2,000ac for sale includes a mix of in-bye pasture, hill ground and woodlandsGalbraith is bringing to the market an extensive area of hill ground in an elevated and spectacular setting between Oban and Crianlarich.
The land at Craig Farm extends to just over 2,000ac and includes a mix of in-bye pasture, hill ground and new and existing woodlands.
The land is situated in a highly scenic landscape of lochs, glens and mountains, just to the north of the River Orchy.

Land potential
Duncan Barrie, a partner with Galbraith, said: "This represents an excellent opportunity to acquire a productive block of hill ground with picturesque views over the surrounding countryside. This is a beautiful area of Argyll and Bute and the river Orchy.
"There is the potential to extend the forestry aspect on the land, subject to obtaining the necessary planting consents, or to continue to use the land for sheep grazing."
The subjects form an attractive block of south-facing hill ground extending to 825.10ha (2,038.10ac) with in-bye pasture adjacent to the River Orchy, and a selection of new and existing woodland plantations.
