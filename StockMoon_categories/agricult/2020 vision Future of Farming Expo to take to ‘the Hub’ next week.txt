2020 vision Future of Farming Expo to take to ‘the Hub’ next weekThe 2020 Future of Farming Expo presented by Kverneland Group Ireland is set to take place in the "Marble City" next week.
Representing the agri implement powerhouse's fifth showing, the event will take place at the Hub, Cillin Hill, Kilkenny on Thursday, February 13, where the latest developments from the Kverneland, Vicon, Siloking and McConnel brands will be on show.
There is free admission on the day, with light refreshments provided during the event, which will run from 1:00pm through to 8:00pm.

The expo follows on from the recent Agritechnica show in Germany where Kverneland Group showed new machines for the first time, along with new features and updates to its current range.
On the arable side, the Enduro cultivator and DTX subsoiler will be launched to the Irish market.
Also on display will be the award winning i-plough, while the new e-drill Maxi Plus Grain and Fertiliser - which is specially adapted where fertilising and seeding in one pass is required - will feature in addition.
On the harvest front the new 5387MT butterfly mower conditioner will be the highlight alongside a range of mower conditioners and plain mowers, the Scandinavian group says.
The 5387MT offers the Kverneland QuattroLinK "race car suspension", semi-swing steel tine conditioner and dual adjustment of the conditioner plate.
Meanwhile the 53100MT BX - in combination with a 3332 front mower - remains the best solution for 10m (33ft) mowing, while the new 9464 mounted rake offers 6.4m (20ft) raking capacity suitable for both farmer and contractor, Kverneland contends.
