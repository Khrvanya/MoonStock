2021 Nuffield Farming Scholarships Trust applications now openApplications have opened for one of the UK's most prestigious agricultural scholarship programmes.
Nuffield Farming Scholarships Trust (NFST) is pleased to announce that applications for 2021 scholarships are now open on the trust's website and will close on July 31, 2020.
Around 20 scholarships are awarded each year, providing successful Nuffield Scholars a substantial bursary toward the travel and research of a topic of interest in farming, food, horticulture or rural industries.
Additional funding also goes towards the attendance of the Contemporary Scholar's Conference, the pre-study briefing and other events.
Nuffield Farming Scholars come from across farming, land-based, food or agriculturally-associated industries.
Findings from scholars' studies have brought relevant and meaningful impact to UK farming that continue to resonate long after a study is completed.
The money awarded to a Nuffield Scholar for their study is not just a scholarship, it's an investment in UK agriculture and in the personal development of the scholar themselves.
Adam Banks, a 2018 Nuffield Scholar and founder of insect farming business Instar Farming, credits his Nuffield Farming Scholarship with helping him grow his business and his profile in the industry.
"My Nuffield Scholarship gave me the opportunity to travel around the world building relationships with people who I probably would never have had the opportunity to meet otherwise," he said.
Trying to launch a business in an emerging and niche industry like insect farming can feel daunting at times, however, Nuffield introduced me to a global community of entrepreneurs all working towards similar goals.
"Since completing my scholarship, I have gone on to develop my business and speak at a range of events, from a local farmer buying group to an international conference at the Natural History Museum."

Mike Vacher, director of the Nuffield Farming Scholarship Trust, added that what scholars learn as part of their study and travels is important not only to the individuals themselves, but UK food and farming industry.
"Food and farming industries in the UK are looking at major changes in the coming years. Nuffield Farming Scholars are ideally suited to contribute their leadership skills and specialist knowledge as our nation looks to improve its food supply and agricultural practice," he said.
"The Nuffield Farming legacy is evident with multiple generations of scholars leading across all sectors of our industry.
We are also very proudly celebrating 2020 as the 'Year of the 1000th Scholar' - an important milestone in our history.
"Every year, applicants impress us with their innovative ideas and passion for their proposed topics of inquiry. We welcome all driven individuals from across the food, agriculture, horticulture and rural industries to apply and encourage those interested to reach out to our main office for support."
How to apply
Those interested in applying for a Nuffield Scholarship are encouraged to begin the process well ahead of the July 31 deadline.
The Nuffield Farming office is able to connect applicants with existing Nuffield Scholars who can provide support and advice about the application process.

Eligibility requirements

Applicants must work within the farming, food, horticulture, rural and associated industries or are in a position to influence these industries;
Applicants must be aged between 22 and 45 years (the upper age limit is 45 on July 31 the year of application);
