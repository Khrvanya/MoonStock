3-crop rule derogation ‘urgently needed’ to manage flood impactsWith thousands of farmers unable to get onto their land to plant crops following Storm Dennis, farming organisations across the UK are calling for an urgent relaxation of the three-crop rule.
The UK Farming Roundtable, which met on Tuesday (February 18), has called for the Government to grant a derogation from the rule and to broaden the extent of the Farming Recovery Fund to help flood-hit farmers with any uninsurable losses as a result of flooding.
Across the Irish Sea, the three-crop rule has already been lifted in the Republic of Ireland, albeit with some conditions.
'Farmland is currently underwater'
A joint statement from members of the UK Farming Roundtable said: "We are facing an unprecedented situation. Relentless rain has meant some farmers won't have been able to get on their land since the autumn.
"A significant area of farmland is currently underwater following two storms in two weeks, compounding the already wet ground conditions from this winter. Many farmers were unable to plant winter crops and are now facing great difficulty planting spring crops.
"There will be many farmers out there really struggling; not just with the immediate impacts of the current flood water but the knock-on effects of damage to farmland and buildings, as well as significant impacts to this season's cropping.

"They will be looking to the Government to be practical and we are urging them to grant a derogation from the three-crop rule, which is completely unworkable for farmers across the country this year.
"We are also urging the government to broaden the Farming Recovery Fund for flood-hit areas to help with any losses they have had from this difficult situation."
