4-year-old girl left terrified by ‘monsters’ after farmhouse burglary ordealNorth Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information following a burglary on a farm in Thorpe Willoughby on New Year's Eve.
The incident happened sometime between 1:00pm and 5:00pm on Tuesday (December 31, 2019) near to the Hambleton Roundabout on Selby Bypass.
Thieves gained entry by snapping the lock of a kitchen window and ransacked every room of the property before stealing a Canadian Ice diamond engagement ring with a white gold band and PS800 of cash.
Police Investigator David Pegg of North Yorkshire Police said: "The victims returned to their home on New Year's Eve and quickly realised that their home had been burgled after finding their front door wide and kitchen window wide open.
Every room had been rifled through and their four-year-old daughter, who saw the aftermath of the burglary, has been left terrified believing that 'monsters' are coming back to get her.
"I appeal to anyone who has any information that could help us to catch those responsible to come forward."
