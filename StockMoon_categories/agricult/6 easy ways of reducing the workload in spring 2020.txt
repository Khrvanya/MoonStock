6 easy ways of reducing the workload in spring 2020The chaos that comes with calving a large number of cows in a short space of time is fast approaching on many spring-calving dairy farms.
However, AgriLand has compiled a list of different ways farmers can relieve some of the pressure at this busy time of the year.
1. Minimise the chances of a disease outbreak
In the midst of the calving season the last thing anyone wants is a disease outbreak.
To avoid this, ensure that your cows are up to date with all vaccines. Where scour - in particular rotavirus - is an issue, a one-shot vaccine can be administered between three and 12 weeks before calving to prevent this.

Also, make sure the calving area, calf housing and feeding equipment are thoroughly cleaned and disinfected before use. In addition, feeding sufficient dry-cow minerals in the lead up to calving will help avoid any metabolic diseases.
Last but not least, feeding adequate colostrum to calves is key to their survival. At least 3L of colostrum per calf should be fed as soon as possible after birth.
2. OAD feeding and/or milking
According to Teagasc, no differences in calf performance or health were observed between calves fed once-a-day (OAD) or twice-a-day (TAD) in trials carried out in Teagasc Moorepark.
However, there was less time spent with calves fed OAD and a 36% overall saving in total calf care time was achieved.
Similarly, to reduce the workload in February, some farmers may opt to milk OAD for the first few weeks during the calving period.
OAD milking has been shown to reduce the labour requirement, while only having a minimal impact on annual milk production.
3. Get cows out to grass early
Trying to get cows out to grass early is another easy way of reducing the workload in the spring.
The downtime between now and when calving is due to start should give you enough time to get set up for the next grazing season.

Make sure all reels are working correctly and all posts are gathered up ready to go for grazing this spring.

Think about where you are likely to graze first; think about which paddocks will have the heaviest covers; and think about those which may be difficult to graze.
Then answer the following questions:

Could any improvements be made in terms of my grazing infrastructure?
Would another gap/entrance be beneficial?
Would installing a spur roadway help?
Are all my roadways up to scratch?
Could another drinker or moving an existing drinker help with grazing next spring?However, AgriLand has compiled a list of different ways farmers can relieve some of the pressure at this busy time of the year.
