It is the most powerful self-propelled forage harvester from the manufacturer thus far.
The version pictured (above and below) is a 'Terra Trac' machine (fitted with a factory-integrated crawler track system). An "intelligent" headland protection system is claimed to prevent damage to the grass cover.

Alongside the new Jaguar 990, Claas launched a package of updates for existing Jaguar models (from the 800 and 900 ranges), as well as a new 4.5m Orbis maize header. Among the updates is a move to Stage 5 engines for Jaguar 900 series machines.
Jaguar 900 series models also get a new armrest console, as well as a new touch-screen Cebis terminal.
In addition, Claas will make a so-called 'Dynamic Steering' system available on these foragers.
