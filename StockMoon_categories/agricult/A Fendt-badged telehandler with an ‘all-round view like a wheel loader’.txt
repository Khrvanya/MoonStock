A Fendt-badged telehandler with an ‘all-round view like a wheel loader’Fendt has teamed up with German-headquartered Sennebogen to offer its first own-brand telehandler (telescopic handler).
The machine was unveiled at this week's Agritechnica show in Germany.
Known as the Cargo T955, this handler's most noteworthy attribute is its lifting cab.
The cab can apparently be raised to a viewing height of 4.25m. A spokesperson said: "Just lifting the cab by a mere 20-30cm gives you the best 360deg all-round view - the likes of which have only been seen on wheel loaders and telescopic wheel loaders.

"There is no dashboard to obstruct the lower part of the continuous windscreen. Instead, you have a floor-to-ceiling view of your surroundings.
"The cab is vibration-dampened, so the driver can enjoy the levels of driving comfort we have come to expect from Fendt. Driving speeds of up to 40kph are available."
According to Fendt, the machine can lift 5.5t; its maximum lift height is 8.5m.
