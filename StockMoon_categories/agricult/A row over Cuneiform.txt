  A row over CuneiformAn ancient artefact is at the centre of a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK. Iran's national museum has threatened to cut all ties with the British Museum to protest a decision to delay the loan of an ancient Persian treasure. The Cyrus Cylinder dates back to the 6th Century BC and is regarded as the world's first declaration of rights. The British Museum says it needs to keep the piece until summer in order to continue its research.

But the head of Iran's state cultural organization said the move was politically motivated.
    
Hamid Baqaie the head of Iran's Cultural Heritage Organisation said his organization would send a letter of complaint to unesco. He also threatened to write to all world museums cautioning them against working with the British Museum.

The cylinder in question was commissioned by Persian king Cyrus, 2,500 years ago. It was loaned to the British Museum for research 10 years ago. It was to be handed back in September, 2009 but the British Museum postponed the handover to February 2010 citing unspecified "practicalities".An ancient artefact is at the centre of a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK.
