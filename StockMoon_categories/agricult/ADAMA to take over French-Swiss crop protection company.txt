ADAMA to take over French-Swiss crop protection companyOne of the world's largest crop science companies, ADAMA Ltd, has today announced it will take over French-Swiss crop protection company, SFP, for an undisclosed sum.
Based in Aix-en-Provence, France and in Sion, Switzerland, SFP was founded in 1987 and has developed a number of focused product positions within the $375 million European plant growth regulator and fungicide markets.
'An attractive portfolio'
Alison Bosher, marketing and technical director for ADAMA in the UK, said: "SFP has an attractive portfolio of straight and differentiated mixture products that it markets in France and other key European countries.
"Among its most significant active ingredients are the plant growth regulators ethephon and chlormequat chloride, and the fungicides prochloraz and cymoxanil, as well as interesting mixtures of each of these.
"The combination of these products, which are highly complementary to ADAMA's existing portfolio, together with our strong commercial network, bolsters our potential for future growth.
