  AIDS vaccine under trial Will the combo drug succeed? 

Clinical trial of a combination vaccine against AIDS has begun in India. The Indian Council of Medical Research, the body governing biomedical research in India, is selecting volunteers for the trial. ADVAX and  tbc-m 4 vaccines have been tested individually and now the researchers are trying to see if they work better in tandem through the prime boost method. In this method, one vaccine is combined with another to boost the effect of the first vaccine. Previous trials of  aids  vaccines have been controversial. In 2005, an  aids  vaccine that had failed in Europe, was tried in India.   

The current trial is being carried out in collaboration with the International  aids  Vaccine Initiative at the National  aids  Research Institute, Pune, and Tuberculosis Research Centre, Chennai.
