  According to reportBirds no more: Eight bird species have vanished from the 25 sq km Salim Ali sanctuary in Ernakulam district, Kerala, said a study by 
Nirmala College in Ernakulam. Changes in their environment, teak plantations for example, may have caused this. The study also recorded the 
number of bird species increased from 132 in the 1930s to 238 in the sanctuary. This included wetland species that increased from 10 to 32, 
possibly because of a new reservoir there. 
Toxic fish: Residues of medicines used to treat high cholesterol, allergies and depression were found in fish near wastewater treatment 
plants serving five US cities. Researchers from Texas said even diluted concentrations of the residues could harm aquatic species.  We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.
