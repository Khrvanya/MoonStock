Additional dates announced for NI dairy antibiotics workshopsA further eight 'Responsible Use of Antibiotics in the Dairy herd' workshops have been organised throughout March.
More than 320 farming family members attended the first cohort of workshops across Northern Ireland.
Organisers say feedback so far has been very positive and added awareness has increased across a range of areas, including how antimicrobial resistance develops, avoiding residues in milk and best practice in using antibiotics without compromising animal health.
Antibiotics have been an essential tool in combating disease for many decades both in human and animal health. However, the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance is a growing concern worldwide.
