Agri-food processing sites ‘among worst for odour and noise’Three agri-food businesses have been named among the worst in terms of complaints for "odour and noise nuisance", according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
According to the agency's list of national priority sites to be targeted for environmental improvement - which features a total of eight sites - Arrow Group in Kildare, Glanbia Foods Ireland Ltd in Laois, Rosderra Irish Meats Group (Edenderry) in Offaly all failed to meet the EPA's environmental standards.
As a result, all eight businesses now face "further enforcement action from the EPA to secure compliance".
The three agri-food sites have been sanctioned primarily for complaints over the smell and noise they produce, as well as failing to properly manage their waste-water discharges.
