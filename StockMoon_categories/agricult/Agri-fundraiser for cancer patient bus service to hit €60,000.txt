IFA president Joe Healy will also be in attendance, along with representatives from Cancer Care West.
The representative for the IFA said: "We have all sorts of prizes tonight. You name it, we've got it. But it's actually the cause itself that attracted the ticket sales; It's a great cause. We couldn't believe how many tickets were sold."
Up to 70 prizes are available for those whose names come out of the hat, including: a weekend away; a tonne of feed; a tonne of coal; and vouchers for fuel, veterinary services, and various types of shops.
