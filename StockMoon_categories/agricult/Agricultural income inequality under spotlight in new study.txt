Agricultural income inequality under spotlight in new studyA focused study on income inequality has found that agriculture is the most unequal sector of the economy in terms of income distribution.
The report - jointly published by the Think-Tank for Action on Social Change (TASC), and the Foundation for European Progressive Studies (FEPS) - indicates that "time spent working" is one of the main reasons behind agriculture's poor performance on income share.
The study, entitled 'The state we are in: inequality in Ireland today', shows that agriculture isn't just the most unequal sector in Ireland - it is also above the average level of inequality in any sector, across seven other 'comparator' countries featured in the study.
According to the findings of the report, agriculture's "low working time" - in other words part-time or seasonal work - is having a considerable impact on income.
Speaking to AgriLand, Dr. Robert Sweeney, researcher on inequality at TASC, said farm size may also be a contributing factor.
It was kind of a surprise to me to find so much inequality in agriculture. Aside from income, there is, of course, a lot of inequality between farmers in other areas.
"Farm sizes vary considerably, which may have been a contributing factor," he said.

Dr. Sweeney added that not all farmers are doing equally well. For instance, he underlined that a dairy farmer "will likely be wealthier than, say, a sheep farmer".
The seven other countries the study looked at were the UK, along with six small, open economies similar to Ireland including: Belgium; Sweden; Denmark; Finland; the Netherlands; and Austria.
The report also highlights the level of employment that the agriculture sector provides nationwide.
5.1% of people are employed in primary industries - in which farming and related activities are included - many of whom are low-skilled workers.
According to Dr. Sweeney, low-skilled labour is also a potential factor.
"If I had to speculate, I would say that income inequality in agriculture is down, mainly, to different farm sizes, and the higher number of low skilled people in that sector," he concluded.
