Aldi extends All-Ireland Angus championships sponsorshipAldi will continue as the lead sponsor of the Aldi Irish Angus All Ireland Bull Calf Championships, following the agreement of a new deal lasting until 2022, the retailer has announced.
Aldi, ABP Ireland and the Irish Angus Cattle Society will sponsor the championships, representing an investment of EUR100,000 over the next four years, a representative for the company has revealed.
Since it started sponsoring the competition back in 2012 in conjunction with its partner companies, a 40% increase in entries has been recorded.
The annual competition sees Ireland's very best Irish Angus bull calves and their breeders battle it out for a share of a generous prize fund.
Since first offering its private-label Angus beef range in 2008, Aldi claims to now account for 33% of Angus retail beef sales in Ireland.
