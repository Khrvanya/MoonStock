Applications open today for energy innovation project fundingThe 2019 SEAI National Energy Research Development and Demonstration Funding programme - a Government-funded initiative which funds innovative energy-research projects - was launched today (Monday, January 21).
The programme was launched by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Richard Bruton.
Up to EUR4 million funding is available this year to fund research project, which aims to help drive Ireland's transition to a clean and secure energy future.
