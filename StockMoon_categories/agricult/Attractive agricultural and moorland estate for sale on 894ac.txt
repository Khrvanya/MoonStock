Adjacent to Emmetts Grange is a Grade II listed courtyard with traditional farm buildings of stone construction with brick quoins, under a slate roof. The courtyard provides a unique and charming aspect to the rear of the house.
Furthermore, these buildings include a tack room (with central heating and hot and cold water), a log store, a garage, a feed store/workshop and a range of stables.
There is also former livestock accommodation that would be suitable for a variety of different uses, subject to the appropriate planning permissions.
