Auction report Fleet of Deutz-Fahr tractors offered for sale in Co. Meath [updated]A significant auction involving tractors and machinery took place today, Saturday, December 7, close to Dunboyne, Co. Meath.
The auction - conducted by Wilsons Auctions - was on behalf of Kieran Lavelle, who is reportedly selling the equipment "due to a change in the farm's machinery policy and a decision to focus on dairy farming".
AgriLand was at the auction to take these photographs and to note the 'hammer' prices. All of the pictures in this report are from the auction itself.

This report focuses on the tractor highlights at the sale.
Important note/update:
Please note that AgriLand originally published this article on Saturday, December 7, in which we indicated that five of the six tractors (detailed below) had been sold. This was based on what was observed at the auction itself.
At the auction, the auctioneer announced that the highest bid for the John Deere tractor was not sufficient; and that he would have to consult with the vendor afterwards. Therefore, we reported that this tractor was not sold (which remains the case - in this updated report).
However, for the single Case IH and four (remarkably well-presented) Deutz-Fahr tractors the auctioneer (upon reaching the highest bid in each case) called 'once; twice; thrice' and audibly brought his gavel/hammer down. We inferred from this (based on a convention observed at other auctions) that these tractors had therefore been sold (subject to the prospective buyers coming up with the requisite funds).
However, after the auction (and shortly after publication of our original report) we were informed by the vendor that none of the six tractors had actually been sold; all are still available for sale. We, therefore, updated the report within a matter of hours to reflect this (and have since added this note - to set out the context of this update/clarification).
All ('hammer') prices were subject to a 'buyer's premium/commission' of 5%.
Some ('hammer') prices were subject to VAT (i.e. VAT must be added to some of the prices below). The VAT status of each lot is specified in the accompanying description.
Any statement of recorded hours may simply be a reflection of what was visible on the machine's odometer or, if that wasn't available, what was claimed in the auction catalogue.

This 2016 Deutz-Fahr Agrotron 6160 CShift (pictured below) was described as follows: 50kph; air brakes; air-suspended cab; front axle suspension; front linkage; 'power beyond'; creeper gears; 650/65R38 rear and 540/65R28 front tyres; 2,872 hours. The hammer dropped at EUR48,000 (plus VAT). However, this bid is now subject to approval/verification and, according to the vendor, the tractor has not yet been sold.



This 2013 Deutz-Fahr Agrotron M650 (pictured below) was described as follows: 50kph; air brakes; air-suspended cab; front axle suspension; front linkage; 'power beyond'; creeper gears; 650/65R42 rear and 540/65R34 front (new) tyres; 5,900 hours. The hammer dropped at EUR42,000 (plus VAT). However, this bid is now subject to approval/verification and, according to the vendor, the tractor has not yet been sold.
