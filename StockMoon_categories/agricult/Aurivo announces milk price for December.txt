Aurivo announces milk price for DecemberThe board at Aurivo has decided to hold its milk price for the month of December, following suit with other co-ops for that month.
The co-op announced today, January 18, that it would maintain its price at 30c/L, including vat.
The Aurivo board acknowledged the more positive market environment in recent weeks, saying it will continue to pay the maximum price to suppliers that market returns will allow.
All co-ops that have so far released their prices for December have decide to hold their base pay-out.
Supplier representative groups had expected that positive market conditions would have allowed processors to hold, or even increase prices.
