Avara Foods to open Telford site to public for open dayOne of the UK's biggest poultry processors, Avara Foods, will open its doors for an open day this Saturday (January 25), hoping to entice young professionals to join its ranks.
The business supplies its chicken, turkey and duck products to several national supermarket and restaurant chains but is looking for fresh talent.
Avara Foods was established in 2018 as a joint venture between Cargill and Faccenda, the company operates a fully-integrated supply chain across agriculture, processing and distribution, and employs around 7,000 people.
The Telford site, where the open day will take place, is one of the company's main processing facilities and employs more than 1,200 people.
On the day, visitors can expect tours of the state-of-the-art factory with its advanced manufacturing technology, a chance to taste some of the delicious products produced on-site, and the opportunity to meet with staff.
The day will also give locals the chance to learn about the range of jobs available at the site and career progression at Avara.
