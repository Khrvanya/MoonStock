Baltic index falls on weaker demand for vessels2 Min ReadJan 23 (Reuters) - The Baltic Exchange's main sea freight index fell to a near one-year low on Thursday, dragged by weaker demand across vessel segments. * The Baltic index, which tracks rates for capesize, panamax and supramax vessels ferrying dry bulk commodities, fell 47 points, or 7.5%, to 576 -- lowest since early February * The capesize index slipped 118 points, or 36.3%, to 207. * The index registered its 30th consecutive session of losses, touching its lowest level since April 3. * Average daily earnings for capesizes, which typically transport 170,000-180,000 tonne cargoes including iron ore and coal, declined $840 to $5,071. * "The market for capesize vessels has turned from bad to worse as prices for low-sulphur fuel oil remain high whilst freight rates deteriorate further," ship broker Fearnleys said in a note on Wednesday. * Spot demand is low as only one of three major Australian miners is currently shipping to China, Fearnleys added. * The panamax index dropped 46 points, or 6.1%, to 714. * Average daily earnings for panamaxes, which usually carry coal or grain cargoes of about 60,000 tonnes to 70,000 tonnes, fell $419 to $6,425. * The supramax index fell by 4 points to 546.
