Beef Plan contacts 3 UK retailers to arrange meetingsThe Beef Plan Movement has recently issued a letter to three of the major retailers in the UK seeking to organise meetings with representatives from each.
A statement on the letter from Beef Plan outlined the purpose of the meetings will be to "highlight the benefits of Irish grass-fed beef and how it would far outweigh any benefit from age restrictions".
A copy of the letter was issued to: Sainsbury's; Asda; and Tesco.
The 'British Retail Consortium (BRC) Global Standards' received a letter also.
The letter - seen by AgriLand - contained three questions on current beef specifications in Ireland.
The questions were as follows:
