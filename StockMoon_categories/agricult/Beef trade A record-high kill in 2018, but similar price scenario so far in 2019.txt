Beef trade A record-high kill in 2018, but similar price scenario so far in 2019While some factories had reopened after the Christmas break last Wednesday, it is business as usual for beef processing plants all over the country today.
Factories will be keen to return to the normal throughput levels witnessed before the Christmas festivities.
Although we are seven days into the new year, it appears the old prices have resumed. Procurement managers are still working off a base price of 375c/kg for steers and 385c/kg for heifers, with little reports of farmers securing higher prices.
While factories are applying pressure to prime cattle, farmers selling P-grade cows can expect to be offered 260-280c/kg. Buyers are starting negotiations with farmers for O-grade and R-grade cows at 280c/kg and 300c/kg respectively.
A closer look at supplies
Some 13,245 cattle were slaughtered in Department of Agriculture approved beef export plants during the week ending December 23 - a decline of 18,179 head. This is a fall of 5,695 head when compared to the corresponding week in 2017.
This fall was expected as many beef processors closed up shop for the Christmas holidays.

During the week ending December 30, steer and heifer throughput led the way at 4,403 head and 4,622 head respectively.
