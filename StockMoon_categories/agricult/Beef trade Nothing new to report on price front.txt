Beef trade Nothing new to report on price frontIt's a case of 'as you were' on the beef price front, with base prices for steers at 375c/kg and heifers at 385c/kg. Some producers have reported an extra 5c/kg for heifers, but the number of farmers achieving these prices are in the minority.
Beef buyers are starting negotiations with farmers for cows at 260c/kg for P-grade cows; poorer-quality cows are achieving lower prices.
In addition, 280-290c/kg is on the table for O-grade animals and 300c/kg is being quoted for R-grade cows. However, the location and demand of individual processing plants plays a role in the price being quoted to farmers for cows.
Moving to bulls this week, factory agents are quoting 330-340c/kg for O-grade bulls, while R-grades are moving for 350-360c/kg; procurement managers are quoting 360-370c/kg for U-grades.
Cattle supplies
Turning to the weekly kill, the total number of 35,267 cattle - excluding calves - were processed during the week ending March 10.
