Beef trade Prime cattle unchanged, but bulls remain difficult in some plantsWhile there is some demand for beef steers and heifers, procurement managers have made no movement on price this week. As it stands, bullocks are still moving at 375c/kg, while heifers are being bought at 385c/kg.
The turbulence when it comes to bull processing has continued in some plants, while others have increased slaughterings. However, weight penalties are still causing problems.
This week, factory agents are quoting 330-340c/kg for O-grade bulls, while R-grades are moving for 360c/kg; procurement managers are quoting 370c/kg for U-grading bulls and maybe 5c/kg higher in some cases.
Most beef cattle buyers are offering 300c/kg for R-grade cows and 280-290c/kg for O-grade types. Looking at cows falling into the P-grade category, these animals are selling at 260-270c/kg.
Cattle throughput
The number of cattle slaughtered in Ireland during the week ending January 27 amounted to 38,049 head, official figures show.
Figures from the Department of Agriculture's beef kill database show that some 138,337 cattle have been slaughtered this year - an increase of 7,822 head on 2018 levels.
