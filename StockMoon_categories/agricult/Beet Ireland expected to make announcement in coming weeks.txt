Beet Ireland expected to make announcement in coming weeksBeet Ireland is expected to make an announcement regarding its plans for the future in the coming weeks. The organisation met last weekend and will release a statement in five to six weeks, AgriLand has been told.
It is unclear how many farmers have put forward EUR1,000 to join a grower co-operative, in the hope of eventually being able to supply beet to a new plant.
However, the group does not have any plans to hold anymore grower meetings in the near future.
EUR1,000 from 1,000 growers
At the beginning of November Beet Ireland declared that it was looking for 1,000 growers to invest EUR1,000 in a grower's co-operative which would form part of the revival of the beet industry in this country.

EUR1 million in the form of a site - at Ballyburn, Co. Kildare - is to be invested into the plan by Beet Ireland, following the collection of the money from growers.
