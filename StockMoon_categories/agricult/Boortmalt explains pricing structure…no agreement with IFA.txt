Boortmalt explains pricing structure…no agreement with IFAIn a strange turn up for the books Boortmalt described its pricing structure for the 2019 season to growers who attended the Teagasc malting barley conference held at two venues yesterday (Enniscorthy and Athy).
AgriLand attended the conference in Athy last night (Monday, February 18). Pierre-Eric Souplet, a markets specialist with Boortmalt in Europe, described how the system will work for 2019.
No agreement has been made between Boortmalt and the Irish Farmers' Association (IFA).
Based on the FOB Creil
The FOB (Free On Board) Creil malting barley price will be used as a reference price.
This is a base price at 20% moisture for unscreened barley, delivered to store and the historic haulage allowance between Boortmalt and some of its growers is included (where applicable).
A bonus of EUR10/t will also be paid for distilling grade barley.
Last week's offers
Offers were made to farmers last week. AgriLand released details of these offers on the day they were announced.

The first offer made on Monday, February 11, was described as the "Model offer". This is based on the average FOB Creil price during the growing or marketing season from weeks 15 to 38. Farmers can place up to 80% of their barley into this option.
A second offer was made last Monday (February 11), which Pierre also explained. This fixed price choice was EUR190/t (base price at 20% moisture). However, this offer is closed.
Rules of commitment
The rules of commitment were outlined. The first was that a protein bonus/allowance will be applicable on all tonnes of malting barley.
Details of two different scenarios are set out below - one where a farmer agrees to commit 100% of their malting barley acreage and the second where a farmer does not commit 100% of their malting barley acreage.
If a farmer engages 100% of their malting barley acreage at their normal yield potential, before the middle of March (possibly March 15) the following will happen:

Boortmalt will support the farmer in the case of a lower yield than the potential committed;
Boortmalt will offer the harvest price for surplus grain, if a yield greater than the original potential yield committed is achieved.AgriLand attended the conference in Athy last night (Monday, February 18).
