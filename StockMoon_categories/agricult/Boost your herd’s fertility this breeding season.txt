Boost your herd’s fertility this breeding seasonAchieve higher conception rates this breeding season through close monitoring of your herd's body condition score (BCS).
The BCS of your herd should be regularly monitored between now and the breeding season to avoid any animals loosing condition or failing to achieve the target range of 2.75 - 3.25 (2.9 average) BCS by mating start date.
Under-conditioned cows or cows with a BCS of less than 2.75 will be slow to regain oestrus and lead to a reduction in your six-week in-calf rate.
As the animals pass through the crush, BCS can be carefully assessed using the flat of your hand across the main primary and secondary reference points. It is important that an overall visual assessment is also given.
Primary reference points:

Pin bones;
Loin or short ribs;
Ribs.

Secondary reference points:

Backbone;
Hip bone;
Shoulder.The BCS of your herd should be regularly monitored between now and the breeding season to avoid any animals loosing condition or failing to achieve the target range of 2.75 - 3.25 (2.9 average) BCS by mating start date.
