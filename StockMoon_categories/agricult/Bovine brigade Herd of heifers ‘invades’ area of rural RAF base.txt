Bovine brigade Herd of heifers ‘invades’ area of rural RAF baseNeighbours of an airbase of the UK Royal Air Force (RAF) got more than they bargained for this morning when "alarms were raised" for an unusual cause - a herd of heifers.
The young cattle broke out from their owner's farm in Shropshire, England, and roamed near an RAF base in Shawbury
After seemingly having a good look around, the animals in question were quickly gathered and led back to the nearby farm from where they broke out in a joint operation of RAF staff, local police and the farmer owner.
