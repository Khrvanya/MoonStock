Brazil’s Marfrig launches global plant-based meat brand1 Min ReadSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian food processor Marfrig Global Foods SA on Monday will launch a global brand of plant-based meat products, according to a statement sent to Reuters on Sunday.  A gourmet hamburger to be served in Brazilian restaurants will be the first product rolled out under the brand Revolution, the statement said. Next year, the veggie burgers will be exported and sold in local supermarkets, the company said. Food processors have been increasing bets on meatless alternatives in response to changing consumer habits. The trend has given rise to non-meat start-ups like Beyond Meat Inc and Impossible Foods Inc in the United States.  In August, Marfrig partnered with U.S.-based Archer Daniels Midland Co to develop processed vegetable meat products. Brazilian Burger King restaurants launched the "Rebel Whopper" in September that contains the plant-based burger jointly created by Marfrig and ADM. Marfrig did not disclose how much it will spend to promote the brand. Reporting by Ana Mano; Editing by Lisa ShumakerAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
