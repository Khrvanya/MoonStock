Commenting on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the minister said: "Managing greenhouse gas emissions will be central to the farm enterprise.
The CAP will be a very different animal when it's looking at carbon as a level of burden for our communities.
Addressing concerns from the floor that agriculture is being unfairly burdened by others who are not pulling their weight, Minister Bruton said: "If this ends up with agriculture fighting with industry, transport or communities, then we will lose.
"We will lose the battle to achieve the structural change that is our responsibility to deliver."
