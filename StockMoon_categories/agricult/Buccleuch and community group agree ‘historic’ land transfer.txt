Buccleuch and community group agree ‘historic’ land transferAn agreement for a transfer of land to the community has been reached between Buccleuch and a nearby community trust.
Edward Morris, estate manager, Borders Estate, said: "We are delighted to see this transfer of land taking place and we wish the community trust every success.
Buccleuch's Borders Estate comprises of 127,000ac; which stretches from the Ettrick and Yarrow Valleys in the Scottish Borders, running almost continuously into Dumfries and Galloway and to the England-Scotland border.
The land, which has been gifted by Buccleuch's Borders Estate to Newcastleton & District Community Trust, is located just north of the English border and encompasses a range of amenity sites in the village.
'A historic moment'
The agreement has been described as a 'historic' moment by the Newcastleton & District Community Trust; with the land involved including a multisport pitch and fitness gym, a golf course and the Holm Show fields.
These sites have already been under long-term use by the community; however, formal transfer of ownership allows the trust to find increased community uses for the land and look at potential improvements of the facilities.
In addition, a mast site has been included to provide the community with an income. Buccleuch said it was delighted to enable the community's plans to utilise the land.

The agreement comes as Buccleuch continues negotiations for the sale of substantial areas of land, including Langholm Moor, to community groups.
"We have been in discussions for some time with groups around Newcastleton and Langholm regarding their aspirations for the local area and we are committed to helping community groups realise their aspirations where we can," said Morris.
Further plans for purchase?
Newcastleton & District Community Trust is continuing to progress plans for the prospective purchase of land in the south of Scotland, with its application being submitted to the Scottish Land Fund and a decision due in May.
"We have had very constructive discussions with Buccleuch about land use and ownership in the area and we look forward to progressing our plans," said Barbara Elborn, secretary of Newcastleton & District Community Trust.
This is a delightful and historic moment for local people.
"We thank them and the Scottish Land Fund for their help and support to enable the community to move forward with its development plans."
