CNH to create more ‘differences’ between its tractor brandsDutch publication Mechaman.nl reports that CNH Industrial, the parent company of Case IH and New Holland, intends to make its tractor brands more different from one another.
According to the Dutch outlet, the comments were made by CNH Industrial's chief executive officer (CEO) Hubertus Muhlhauser (pictured below). Since his appointment, he has apparently been spearheading a new strategic plan.

Mechaman.nl quoted Muhlhauser as saying that CNH Industrial was seeking to grow externally (by acquiring other companies - presumably including manufacturers of machines that could plug gaps in CNH Industrial's existing product portfolio).
Such developments might, for example, see the advent of more Case IH branded equipment, following the recent arrival of a plethora of additional New Holland badged machinery (courtesy of the take-over of Kongskilde).

Most notably, the aforementioned strategic plan will also seek to create "greater differentiation" between the New Holland, Case IH and Steyr tractor brands - not only in appearance but also in technology.
