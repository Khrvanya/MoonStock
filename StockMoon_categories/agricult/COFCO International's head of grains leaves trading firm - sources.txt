COFCO International's head of grains leaves trading firm - sources1 Min ReadPARIS, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Paul Bateson, head of grains at COFCO International since 2018, has left the the Chinese-owned trading firm, market sources said on Thursday. Bateson worked for Bunge and Nidera, also international grain merchants, before joining COFCO International. A spokesman for the firm declined to comment, while Bateson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bateson's departure was reported earlier by Bloomberg. COFCO International, controlled by Chinese state-owned food group COFCO, was established in 2017 following the acquisitions of Nidera and Noble Agri, another agricultural commodity trader. The Geneva-based trading firm has since overhauled its operations and seen a series of management changes as it seeks to expand its presence in major grain production zones.
