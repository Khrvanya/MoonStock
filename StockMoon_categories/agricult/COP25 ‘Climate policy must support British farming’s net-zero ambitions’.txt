COP25 ‘Climate policy must support British farming’s net-zero ambitions’The National Farmers' Union is calling for the next Government to develop climate policy that empowers British farmers to reach their ambition of net-zero agriculture by 2040.
It comes as world leaders and climate ambassadors continue to discuss the need for urgent climate action at the UN climate summit COP25.
In its General Election Manifesto, the NFU emphasises the crucial role the future Government has to play in creating a policy environment that incentivises farm businesses to reduce their impact on our climate and collectively work towards net-zero agriculture.
NFU president Minette Batters said: "British farmers are already producing some of the most sustainable food in the world and we want to do even more. But we cannot achieve net-zero without Government investment.
Any measures farmers take towards net-zero will require investment and significant changes, and we need the future Government to create policy which ensures these steps are not only right for the environment, but right for our businesses too.
"With the appropriate research and a range of incentives to help farmers improve productive efficiency, increase carbon capture and boost renewable energy, we can build on our work producing high quality, sustainable food for the nation.

"British farmers are part of the solution to the climate crisis. We have a huge opportunity in this country to be pioneers in climate-friendly food production - we have the ambition, we just need the right policy to support us."
The NFU's call comes after it hosted its first net-zero advisory panel with renowned scientists and academics to discuss its net-zero report and the short, medium and long-term measures that will be needed for British farming to achieve net-zero by 2040.
