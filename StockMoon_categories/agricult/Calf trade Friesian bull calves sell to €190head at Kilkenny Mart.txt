Price of calves
While calf sales are still in the early days and it is hard to gauge what calves will make over the coming weeks, beef farmers are being urged to base the prices they pay for calves on realistic costs and expected beef prices.
Recent work by Teagasc showed that targeting a EUR200/head profit - under a 24-month steer system - and a factory price of EUR3.90/kg, the value of a Friesian bull calf stands at -EUR8/head when both fixed and variable costs are factored in.

Using the same criteria, Aberdeen Angus and Hereford bull calves are valued at EUR122/head. In addition, cross-bred Jersey bull calves are valued at -EUR107/head.
Speaking at a recent beef event in Co. Kilkenny, Teagasc's head of knowledge transfer, Pearse Kelly, highlighted that there needs to be a sense of reality when it comes to the prices paid for calves.
He highlighted that well-ran dairy calf-to-beef systems are profitable. However, farmers must choose their system carefully and set out targets that are achievable. For example, avoiding certain systems - such as an under-16 month bull system - is important.
