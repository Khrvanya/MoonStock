Calf trade What are calves making at the martsLooking at the latest statistics from the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) - so far this year - some 31,674 calves were registered to dairy dams up to the week ending January 25.
In addition, some 24,925 beef calves have been registered to suckler cows up to and including this date, according to the ICBF.
At mart level, numbers are still on the low side in the grand scheme of things and market prices are hard to gauge so far. Mart managers are expecting larger quantities from mid-February on.
Fermoy Mart
Speaking to AgriLand, Sean Leahy - Fermoy Mart manager - outlined that the sales are still small; however, he highlighted that the trade has been good thus far.
"Sales have been small, but not a bad trade. Most of the Aberdeen Angus and Hereford bulls are selling for EUR200 plus - even for younger types.
"Angus and Hereford heifers are making EUR130-140/head, while strong Friesian bulls are selling in the region EUR120-130/head."
Overall, Friesian bull calves are trading at EUR50-130/head and Sean noted that shippers were in the market for that heavier calf with "a good bit of feeding".
He also noted that farmers were willing to pay over EUR100/head for Friesian bull calves.
"The true reflection of the trade will be in three weeks time - it's hard to fully gauge it yet. We had 70 calves on Tuesday. In a months time that will rise by 700-800 calves; it will go up tenfold.
"And, I think there are plenty of customers out there for that better calf - once they have that bit of feeding in them."

In addition, a number of Belgian Blue heifer calves were on offer; these young heifers made in the region of EUR250/head.
Bandon Mart
Some 300 calves were presented for sale on Monday last at Bandon Mary - an increase on 50 calves on the previous sale.
The mart's manager Tom McCarthy said that the trade was good and exporters forked out prices of EUR50-80/head for Friesian bull calves, while the stronger lots made EUR80-140/head.
Hereford and Angus bulls went under the hammer for EUR160-250/head. However, better-quality - six-to-eight weeks old - whiteheads and Angus calves sold for EUR300/head.
Early-maturing heifers came to EUR130-220/head and up to EUR250/head for strong lots.
"We hard increased activity around the ring this week which led to slight improvement in price. We had some farmers buying, but the majority of the Friesians were purchased by shippers."
Tullow Mart
Speaking to AgriLand, Tullow Mart manager - Eric Driver - noted that calf sales are just getting up and running.
He said: "We're not seeing any great numbers at the minute. But, the lighter Friesian bulls are selling for EUR80-100/head, but older calves with a bit of power in them are selling for EUR100-130/head.
"Some continental good-quality bulls are making EUR360-400/head, with Angus and Hereford heifers trading for EUR100-190/head; bulls will break the EUR200/head mark."
In addition, black Limousin lots are selling at EUR250-260/head, he said.

How much should beef farmers pay for bull calves from the dairy herd? 



Hereford and Angus bulls went under the hammer for EUR160-250/head. However, better-quality - six-to-eight weeks old - whiteheads and Angus calves sold for EUR300/head.
Early-maturing heifers came to EUR130-220/head and up to EUR250/head for strong lots.
"We hard increased activity around the ring this week which led to slight improvement in price. We had some farmers buying, but the majority of the Friesians were purchased by shippers."
Tullow Mart
Speaking to AgriLand, Tullow Mart manager - Eric Driver - noted that calf sales are just getting up and running.
He said: "We're not seeing any great numbers at the minute. But, the lighter Friesian bulls are selling for EUR80-100/head, but older calves with a bit of power in them are selling for EUR100-130/head.
"Some continental good-quality bulls are making EUR360-400/head, with Angus and Hereford heifers trading for EUR100-190/head; bulls will break the EUR200/head mark."
In addition, black Limousin lots are selling at EUR250-260/head, he said.
