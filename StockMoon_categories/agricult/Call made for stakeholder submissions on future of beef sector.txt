Call made for stakeholder submissions on future of beef sectorBeef industry stakeholders and interested parties have been invited to send in written submissions on the future of the sector by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

There is also the possibility that those who make submissions may be asked to appear before the committee to discuss the submission and relevant issues.
Commenting on the matter, committee chair Pat Deering said: "The Agriculture Committee has spent a significant amount of time examining the beef sector and its vulnerability in light of Brexit, as well as the possible opportunities that a more diverse global market could offer Irish beef farmers.
