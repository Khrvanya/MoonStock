Cardigan mart closure ‘another blow’ for industryThe announcement by J.J. Morris Auctioneers that Cardigan Animal Market will close next month, has been described as another blow for the industry by the Farmers' Union of Wales.
According to the auctioneer, the final market will be held on Monday, September 9. It is believed that the closure of Cardigan mart will not affect markets in Crymych and Whitland.
The mart ran sales for fat lambs and cull sheep and calves every Monday. As well as sales for store cattle, weaned calves, grazing cows and breeding stock on the first and third Monday of the month.
Rising costs, reduced animals and TB outbreaks in the area were cited as reasons for the closure.
It comes less than a month after it was announced Cowbridge Mart would close, leaving some farmers with a 45-mile trip to sell their stock.

Commenting, FUW deputy president Brian Thomas said: "This announcement comes just weeks after we heard that Cowbridge market is closing and can only be described as another blow for our industry.
The auctioneers have valid reasons for closing the site and it won't have been an easy decision for them to make.
"The closure of any local mart removes a vital lifeline from the community and also makes it necessary for farmers to travel far greater distances to sell their stock.
"Sadly this is a sign of the times and I fear for the future of some smaller livestock markets."
