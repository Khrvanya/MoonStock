The People's Bank of China (PBOC) announced a day earlier a new batch of 500 billion yuan of re-lending and re-discount quotas - lending money to other banks in the Chinese financial system - to counter the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak on small businesses. The central bank also said it will step up funding support to key industries and areas such as travel agencies, restaurants, hotels and transportation firms, and will keep issuing cheap specialized re-lending quotas to local banks until June 2020.
