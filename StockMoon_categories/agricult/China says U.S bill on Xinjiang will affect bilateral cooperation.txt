China says U.S bill on Xinjiang will affect bilateral cooperation1 Min ReadBEIJING, Dec 4 (Reuters) - China's foreign ministry said on Wednesday the U.S. bill targeting camps for Muslim minorities in Xinjiang will affect bilateral cooperation in important areas. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying made the remarks in response to a question on whether the bill will affect the ongoing trade negotiations. She said no one should underestimate Beijing's resolve to safeguard its interests on matters including Xinjiang.
