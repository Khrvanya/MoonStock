China says it is committed to resolving issues in trade deal with U.S.1 Min ReadBEIJING, Dec 13 (Reuters) - China's Foreign Ministry, when asked about the trade deal with the United States, said it is committed to resolving the issues but the deal must be mutually beneficial. Spokeswoman Hua Chunying made the comments on Friday at a daily briefing. The United States and China are coming up against a natural deadline on Dec. 15 when a tariff hike will come into effect. Washington has set its terms for the first part of the so-called "phased deal", offering to suspend some tariffs on Chinese goods and cut others in exchange for Beijing buying more American farm goods, U.S. sources have said. Beijing has so far remained silent. (Reporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Himani Sarkar)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
