  Climate  jamboreeWe don't look close to a post-Kyoto accord. Barack Obama seems to be having second thoughts about the US taking climate commitments. But event managers are hard at work.  

The Denmark based event management company Adamas Events has started sending e-mails "welcoming  you to COP15 Copenhagen 2009". 
  

"In case you want to arrange an event for your delegates or business partners during the time of COP15 Copenhagen, we hereby offer our local knowledge and know-how," the message said.
