Co-Op Food boss to address Northern Ireland food industryJo Whitfield, chief executive for Food at the Co-Op will be the keynote speaker at the 23rd Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association's (NIFDA) Annual Dinner - the largest annual gathering of the Northern Ireland food processing industry.
The event, which is run in partnership with Danske Bank, will be held on Thursday, October 17 in the Hilton Hotel, Belfast.
Over 250 people are expected to attend the dinner, which is recognised as an opportunity for food and drink industry leaders to discuss how the industry and wider food chain can address challenges and achieve successful growth.
Speaking ahead of the dinner, Michael Bell, executive director of NIFDA, said: "These are challenging times for our local economy and for the industry - just weeks away from Brexit and the risk of a potential 'no-deal'.
"NIFDA continues to lobby the UK Government on behalf of our members, working on a number of committees to put forward the case for our food and drink sector, which overall employs in the region of 100,000 people.
Food and drink is the largest manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland and has continued to grow at a time when many other industries are contracting.
"Whilst we cannot ignore the challenges and uncertainty surrounding Brexit, our focus remains on producing high-quality food, ensuring continuity of supply for our customers and adapting to evolving consumer expectations.
