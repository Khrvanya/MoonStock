Commentary Dairy commodity prices and global milk supplyOver the last couple of weeks, the European dairy quotations have seen the recent trend of firmer butter and skim milk powder (SMP) continue, while future markets through next year have been a little mixed.
This is according to Peter Meehan, the senior commodity analyst at INTL FCStone, who provided AgriLand, last week, December 2, with the following commentary on dairy markets.

Commenting on the current state of the dairy markets, Peter said: "The European butter quotation gained 1.7% over the last two weeks - climbing to an 18-week high of EUR3,620. Despite the gains, European butter remains 17% below year-ago levels.
"European Energy Exchange (EEX) butter's future, meanwhile, have come under a little pressure this week, with the December 2019 to July 2020 contracts down 1.6% - for an average price of EUR3,643.
European SMP continued its 'march higher' with both the European SMP quotation and EEX SMP futures seeing gains.
"The European SMP quotation moved up by 1.6% to EUR2,560 this week - 57% above where it was this time last year.
"EEX SMP futures were up 0.9% over the last two weeks across its December 2019 to July 2020 contracts; for an average price of EUR2,637."
