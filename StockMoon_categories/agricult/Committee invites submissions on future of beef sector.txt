At the time, the committee announced that it was aiming to identify what policy adjustments were needed to ensure the beef sector continued to play a "key role" in the growth of the agri-food industry.
The agriculture committee has spent a significant amount of time examining the beef sector and its vulnerability in the light of Brexit, as well as the possible opportunities that a more diverse global market could offer Irish beef farmers.
Speaking last month, the committee's chairperson, Pat Deering, said: "This call for submissions is part of the process of engagement that we hope will contribute towards supporting a strong beef industry.
"I would encourage stakeholders and interested parties to make their submissions in order to ensure that their voices are heard at this crucial time for the industry," he added.
