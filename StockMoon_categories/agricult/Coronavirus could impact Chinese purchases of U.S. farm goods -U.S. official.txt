Coronavirus could impact Chinese purchases of U.S. farm goods -U.S. official1 Min ReadWASHINGTON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The coronavirus outbreak in China could reduce Chinese purchases of American agricultural products this year under the U.S.-China Phase 1 trade deal, White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said on Tuesday. "We expect the Phase 1 deal will allow China to import more food and open those markets to American farmers, but certainly as we watch this coronavirus outbreak unfold in China it could have an impact on how big, at least in this current year, the purchases are," O'Brien told an event at the Atlantic Council.
