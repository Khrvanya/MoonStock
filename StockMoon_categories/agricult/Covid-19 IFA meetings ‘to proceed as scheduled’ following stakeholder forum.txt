"Like all families, farm families are very concerned about the virus.
There is an additional concern about the potential impact the virus would have at farm level should a farmer be missing from the farm for any period due to illness.
"It is extremely important that appropriate measures are put in place, and adhered to, but it is important that measures are proportionate and are based on advice from health professionals," the IFA spokesperson said.
HSE mass gathering guidelines include notes to: ensure there are sufficient hygiene facilities available; ensure there are supplies to enable the regular cleaning of surfaces; and to advise potential attendees and staff not to attend the event if unwell.
