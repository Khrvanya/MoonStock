He added that it will also aid in "renewing the strong bonds that exist between Ireland with both Portugal and Spain and fostering business relationships against an overall backdrop of celebrating the global Irish abroad and their achievements all over the world".
"I look forward to seeing the Cristo Rei statue which is participating in the Global Greening initiative.
In the context of the UK possibly leaving the EU on the 29 March, the Irish Government remains firmly of the view that the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal and protect the Good Friday Agreement and the integrity of the single market is to ratify the withdrawal agreement.
"Due to the uncertainty, my itinerary takes on an important added dimension.
"My political meetings and trade promotion events will be marked by the Government's firm intention to secure and strengthen our markets for Irish agri-food products outside the UK."
