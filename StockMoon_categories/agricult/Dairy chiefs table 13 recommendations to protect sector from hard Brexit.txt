Dairy chiefs table 13 recommendations to protect sector from hard BrexitRepresentatives from Dairy Industry Ireland (DII) met with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Michael Creed, last week in an effort to address how the dairy sector - on both sides of the border - would be exposed as a result of high tariffs and regulatory barriers in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
In the event of such a scenario, DII has warned of the "potential" for major trade and economic disruption to farmers and the industry as a whole.
At last week's meeting DII presented the minister with a list outlining 13 recommendations to protect the sector.
Some of its chief propositions included: a transition and freeze on the imposition of tariffs even in a no-deal scenario; retaining the status quo on origin labelling for milk; clearance for the inward and outward processing of milk on both sides of the border; and supports to ensure issues around exports, transport and veterinary are streamlined.
DII also sought the following:

Companies be allowed to claim VAT as an input credit at the same time as declaring their liability in order to minimise cashflow needs;
Introduction of trade support measures;
Introduction of direct supports for dairy processors looking to re-tool and re-invest in plant and machinery;
Avoidance of regulatory divergence in standards to ensure unhindered entry of product into UK, EU and world markets;
Farmers receive direct income aid in the event of sterling depreciation following a no-deal Brexit;
Structural and adjustment support measures for farmers where necessary;
A multi-annual framework for funding Brexit mitigation within a temporary EU state aid framework;
Introduction of an enterprise stabilisation fund;
And the introduction of additional marketing and innovation supports for companies looking to reformulate, repackage or innovate their product lines for new markets.In the event of such a scenario, DII has warned of the "potential" for major trade and economic disruption to farmers and the industry as a whole.
