Dairygold cuts February milk priceDairygold has confirmed that it has reduced its milk price for February supplies.
Following a meeting of the board today (Tuesday, March 19), the co-operative has confirmed that its base price for February milk supplies is 31.19c/L including VAT and bonuses.
This is based on standard constituents of 3.3% protein and 3.6% butterfat,
The February price is a reduction of 1.0c/L on January's base milk price, according to a spokesperson for the processor.
This equates to a farm gate milk price of 35.98c/L based on average February milk solids for Dairygold milk suppliers, the representative added.
"Dairy markets have retreated, with butter returns falling and, while protein returns have increased, they are not compensating for the fall in butter returns.
The Dairygold board reviews milk price on a monthly basis. The society has supported milk price over market returns for many months which is not sustainable.
"Unfortunately, it is now necessary to bring milk price closer to market returns," the co-op spokesperson concluded.
