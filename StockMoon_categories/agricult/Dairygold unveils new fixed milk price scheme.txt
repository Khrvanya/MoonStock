Dairygold unveils new fixed milk price schemeThe board of Dairygold has approved a new fixed milk price scheme - FMPS 4.
According to the co-op, the new offering is designed to offer milk suppliers a voluntary option to help manage milk price volatility and deliver price certainty on a fixed volume of their milk supply.
The scheme follows the success of the society's three previous fixed milk price schemes in 2016, 2017 and 2018, according to the co-op.
The dairy processor is writing to all milk suppliers this week offering a fixed base price of 31.5c/L, including VAT, full balanced scorecard, and sustainability bonuses of 0.65c/L, set at reference milk constituents of 3.3% protein and 3.6% butterfat.
This is equivalent of 35.05c/L at the society's 2018 average protein and butterfat results.
