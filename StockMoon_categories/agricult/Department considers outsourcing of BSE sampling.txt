According to the Polish Press Agency (PAP), the State Veterinary Institute informed the World Organisation for Animal Health that symptoms had been discovered in a cow in the region of Lower Silesia, in the south-west of the country along the Czech Republic border.
The discovery symptoms were noticed in the animal on Thursday, January 24, and the disease was confirmed to be present by laboratory testing on Thursday, January 31.
PAP reports that the animal was killed and disposed of.
"According to the legislation of the World Organisation of Animal Health, BSE in an atypical form does not affect the status of Poland as a country with negligible BSE risk," said Prof. Krzysztof Niemczuk, director of the State Veterinary Institute, quoted in PAP.
