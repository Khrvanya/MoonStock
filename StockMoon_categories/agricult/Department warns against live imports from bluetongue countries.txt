Department warns against live imports from bluetongue countriesAnyone considering importing ruminant animals from bluetongue-affected countries should only do so if absolutely necessary, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has warned.
This is because such a move is the most likely route of introduction of the bluetongue virus into Ireland.
The department has warned that even animals with bluetongue vaccination records may harbour bluetongue, adding that infected animals may not show any clinical signs and may only be detected through testing their blood for the virus.
The high-risk period for Bluetongue in Ireland is during the vector season, which is between April and early December each year.This is because such a move is the most likely route of introduction of the bluetongue virus into Ireland.
