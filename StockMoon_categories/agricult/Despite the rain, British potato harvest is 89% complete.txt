Despite the rain, British potato harvest is 89% completeBritish farmers have persevered in the face of adversity to complete 89% of the potato harvest during the wettest year since 2012.
Due to the success of the harvest and volume of the stored crop, Christmas roasties and crisps are expected to be safe.
However, the challenge for farmers still unable to lift crops due to wet or flooded ground will now be cash flow and the cost of labour while machinery lays idle.
Head of arable market intelligence David Eudall said: "Farmers have worked through challenging conditions to harvest the majority of potatoes planted this year, which is a testament to their resilience.
"However, for those who couldn't lift earlier in the year, the saturated or flooded ground is affecting their ability to access the crop. Particularly in the north-west of the country, Yorkshire and Lincolnshire."
Current data shows that 2-3% of the crop is now unlikely to be lifted due to saturated soils degrading quality.
"This figure could rise as we head into December if weather conditions don't improve. For the remainder of potatoes in the ground, it will remain a question of whether quality will hold up for lifting in the New Year.

"Financially, it will be a challenging period for those who were unable to lift crop during the drier weather and growers will be monitoring drainage and the depth of winter frosts carefully, as these will affect what's salvageable."
Historically, 2012 was the last wettest year when 375mm of rain fell in the UK, but not as wet as the year 2000 when a total of 498mm hit the country, according to data from AHDB's weather hub.
