Doyle unveils new measures to improve forestry biodiversityThe opening of three new measures to support biodiversity of Irish forests were announced today (Tuesday, January 22) by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Andrew Doyle.
Commenting on these measures, the minister said that they come directly from the mid-term review of the current National Forestry Programme.
These new measures will serve to further enhance the sustainability of Irish forestry by supporting these key biodiversity initiatives.
According to Minister Doyle, the review has already shown "significant" improvements in the biodiversity of Irish forestry - including a 20% increase in the planting of broadleaf trees last year.
"Existing and new forest owners should examine these measures closely when considering planting or the management of their existing forests."
The new measures are as follows:

A new scheme to support 'Continuous Cover Forestry' (CCF), which allows for the production of commercial timber while retaining forest cover at all times;
A new Deer Tree Shelter (DTS) and Deer/Hare Fencing Scheme which aims to support land owners who wish to plant broadleaves in areas where there is a risk of deer damage;
Changes to the Woodland Improvement Scheme (WIS) to introduce grant aid to carry out a second thinning intervention for broadleaf forests.Commenting on these measures, the minister said that they come directly from the mid-term review of the current National Forestry Programme.
