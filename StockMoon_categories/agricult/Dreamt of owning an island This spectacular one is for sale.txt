Gardens and grounds
Lying within a perimeter fence, the enclosed garden and grounds at the house extend to about 2.4ac and include manicured lawns and mature trees. There is a small gravel area next to the house with trees and shrubs.
The land comprises about 100ac of pasture, and about 16ac of miscellaneous land. It is laid out in enclosures divided by stock-proof fencing, with hedging and mature trees providing shelter.
Adjacent to the public road there is water via a mains supply and outdoor livestock handling facilities. A pond is situated in the centre of the island.
The extensive block of farmland lies within a perimeter fence and is well-suited for the grazing of livestock and production of silage/hay.
