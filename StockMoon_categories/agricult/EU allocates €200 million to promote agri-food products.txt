EU allocates ˆ200 million to promote agri-food productsThe European Commission has announced it will allocate a total of EUR200.9 million in 2020 to fund promotion activities for EU agri-food products both within the EU and abroad.
According to a statement from the European Commission, EU policy on the promotion of agri-food products is designed to help the sector take advantage of the expanding global agri-food market, raise awareness on quality schemes and help producers should they face market disturbances.
The funding announcement comes following last week's news that Bord Bia's application to the European Commission seeking a fund of EUR3 million to promote Irish suckler beef in key European markets was denied.
Commenting on the funding, the EU Commissioner for agriculture and rural development Phil Hogan said: "Europe's reputation in the world for agri-food products is unparalleled.
The EU is not the top world agri-food exporter by accident. Our promotion policy supports EU producers in making their products known both in the EU and outside but also in facing market difficulties.
"The trade agreements in place also create the conditions to increase their exports to high-growing markets.
"The recent conclusion of the EU-China bilateral agreement on geographical indications is yet another example of the Commission's work to create opportunities for producers and high-quality EU products."
