Emergency funding released for Yorkshire farmersThe Prince's Countryside Fund has announced that it will donate PS50,000 from its emergency fund to help farmers and rural communities affected by the flooding in North Yorkshire.
At least 30 farms in Reeth and Arkengarthdale have been severely damaged with a further 80 damaged to a lesser degree.
Many have lost buildings, animals, stone walls, feed and crops to the floods, with the cost of damage expected to soar into the millions.
The money from the Prince's Countryside Fund will be distributed through The Addington Fund, a charity which was set up in response to the 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease epidemic.
The Addington Fund is also working with ForageAid, which supports farmers whose livestock has been affected by an extreme weather event by providing forage or bedding to those in need.

Prince's Countryside Fund director Claire Saunders said: "The flooding in Yorkshire has been localised but is very severe, with farms having lost hundreds of sheep, miles of dry-stone walls being destroyed, and machinery washed away.
The Prince's Countryside Fund aims to support the people who live and work in our countryside and we hope that this emergency funding will help to get those affected back on their feet.
"Rural and farm businesses are key to supporting thriving countryside communities and we want to help get those affected up and running again as soon as possible."
Addington Fund chief executive Bill Young said: "We are delighted, that as usual, the PCF is one of the first charities to act.
Farmers in such situations tend to suffer in silence and this will enable us, in conjunction with our fellow charity Forage Aid to act swiftly.
"Our first concerns will be to help with dead stock disposal and ensuring animals have enough uncontaminated feed and forage to get through this difficult period.

"Both charities have the infrastructure in place to react quickly and our aim will be to help get these farms ready for what could be a difficult winter anyway with so much uncertainty in the market place. We are very grateful to Claire and her team for identifying the need and acting so rapidly."
