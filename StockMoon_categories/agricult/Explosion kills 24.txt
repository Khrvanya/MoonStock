  Explosion kills 24Firecracker factory was operating illegally
an explosion  in a firecracker factory in Maharashtra's Jalgaon district killed 24 people, including six minors, and 
injured 35 others.  

The police are yet to ascertain the cause of the explosion on April 10 at Savitri Fireworks, at Parola, about 60 km from Jalgaon city. "The 
factory's licence was suspended in October last year, but we were not informed about it," said Kunal Kumar, collector of Jalgaon. According to 
Kumar, whenever the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation revokes the licence of a firecracker factory, it has to inform the district 
administration in writing. Savitri Fireworks is owned by Govind Eknath Shirole, Shiv Sena leader and president of Parola municipal council. The 
police have registered a case against the owner and the factory's top officials.   

S M Mannan, deputy controller of explosives, who is looking into the incident, refused to comment saying he was not authorized to speak to the 
press. In February this year, an explosion in another illegal firecracker factory in Beed district had killed seven workers (see 'Explosion kills young 
girls',  Down To Earth, February 16-28, 2009).    We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us. Together we build journalism that is independent, credible and fearless.
