Extreme tractor run chartered for charity to Mayo…from LondonPreparations are well underway for a tractor run with an "extreme" twist - which will travel from the UK capital of London all the way to Co. Mayo in 2020.
Mayo organisation Extreme Tractor Runs is currently in the process of organising "one of its biggest vintage tractor runs to date" in the form of its London2Mayo Charity Tractor Run.
The tractor run will start in London on April 5, 2020, and arrive in Mayo on April 11, 2020.
According to the organisers, all funds raised will go to the Cancer Fund for Children's Capital Appeal to build Daisy Lodge in Cong, Co. Mayo.
This is a respite centre for children with cancer which needs full fundraising. At present, there is only one such centre on the island in Newcastle, Co. Down, which sees some 500 families avail of this service annually.
Cancer Fund for Children can only provide one in seven families from the Republic of Ireland with a short break at present - which is why the charity has made the decision to build a second Daisy Lodge in Cong, Co. Mayo, according to Extreme Tractor Runs.

It is envisaged that building on Cancer Fund for Children's therapeutic break centre Daisy Lodge, Co. Mayo, will commence in the next 18 to 24 months - during which time the charity will continue to raise EUR14.5 million needed to make the plan a reality.
