In all, the Torion line-up consists of seven models - available in three body sizes.
According to Claas, the 1410 is powered by a 155hp DPS (Deere Power Systems) engine. Drive to the axles is via a hydrostatic Varipower transmission.
The 1410's (articulated) tipping load capacity is 9.1t.
A 7in in-cab touch-screen is a standard fitting. Driver-assistance aids include a programmable bucket-return function and defined lifting and lowering limits, that allow the boom to return to a pre-set position.
Tractor line-up
Heading the line-up of Claas tractors at the event will be a 410hp Axion 950.
It's powered by an FPT (Fiat Powertrain Technologies) Cursor-9 engine. Constant torque is apparently achieved at between 1,300 and 1,500rpm. The minimum idling speed is just 650rpm.

The latest Axion 900 series specification includes a choice of two operating systems - either the touch-screen CEBIS control terminal or the new CIS+.
Also on display will be tractors from the Arion line-up; buyers can choose the full CEBIS touch-screen controller, the new CIS+ set-up or the standard CIS system.
Completing the line-up will be models from the small Atos range, which comprises six models. The three-cylinder 200 models have power outputs of 76, 88 and 97hp. The four-cylinder 300 variants are rated at 88, 102 and 109hp.
Drive is through either a 10F 10R mechanical, 20F 20R Twinshift or 30F 30R Trishift transmission, with either a mechanical or Revershift reverser.
