FUW to host consultation events on Sustainable Farming Scheme plansThe Farmers' Union of Wales (FUW) has announced plans to host a series of meetings to discuss the Welsh Government's Sustainable Farming and Our Land consultation.
The consultation, which was launched by Rural Affairs Minister Lesley Griffiths in July, outlines proposals for future farm and rural support which have been revised in light of the response to the 2018 Brexit and Our Land consultation.
It proposes that future support should be designed around the principle of sustainability in a way which brings together the 'wide-ranging and significant economic, environmental and social contribution or farmers'.

The proposals would see support distributed through a single Sustainable Farming Scheme based on:

The principles of providing a meaningful and stable income stream;
Rewarding outcomes in a fair way;
Paying for both new and existing sustainable practices; and
The flexibility to apply to every type of farm.


Farmers' Union of Wales president Glyn Roberts said: "We welcome the fact that the consultation document acknowledges many of the concerns raised by respondents to last years Brexit and Our Land consultation, and focuses on farmers and food producers.

"Concerns highlighted by the FUW last year about the dangers of setting a fixed timetable and ploughing ahead with proposals at a time of complete uncertainty over Brexit and its impacts, and undertaking detailed modelling and economic assessments of proposals before coming to any decision, also appear to have been taken on board."
Roberts said that this acknowledgement and the consultative tone of the document would help to discuss the proposals with the industry and urges farmers to join the FUW at its consultation meetings.
Whilst we hope that the Welsh Government will indeed extend the consultation period, until we have had clear confirmation that this is the case, we will do our best to ensure that farmers understand the proposals.
"I would, therefore, urge anyone with an interest in the future of agriculture, and our rural economy to join us at one of our meetings to discuss what is being proposed," he said.
