Farmland, stables and a helicopter hanger…soon to ‘fly’ off the marketMoyview, located at Rinroe, Enniscrone, Co. Sligo (Eircode: F26 XD99), is a magnificent residential and agricultural estate, set on beautiful, mature grounds and extending to about 131ac (53ha) in total.
It is a private estate with a spectacular coastal situation, with about 1.4km of coastline, and is located in the west of Ireland and on the banks of the tidal River Moy Estuary.
Comprising a house, residential accommodation, outbuildings, farmland and a coastline, Moyview offers a well-established estate - the sale of which is being facilitated by Savills.

Approximate locations from the property include: Enniscrone 6km; Ballina 9km; Ireland West (Knock) Airport 47km; Sligo Town 56km; Sligo Airport 60km; Galway City 121km; and Dublin Airport 248km.
Amenities aplenty
The present owner's family purchased the estate in 1993 and have carried out a significant programme of renovation and redecoration to the house, cottages and outbuildings. A stud farm was previously run at Moyview by the family.
The farmland, which is presently all in grass with extensive road frontage on the eastern side and good internal farm roads, is let on a conacre basis to a number of local farmers for silage and grazing.
The ploughable pasture lies within a ring-fenced block and is generally level, with a gentle westerly elevation and rises from the estuary on the west to about 26m (85ft) on the south-easterly corner.
There is a mains water supply to the land and electric fencing.

The land can be classified as follows:

Ploughable pasture/silage ground: 120ac;
Woods: 1ac;
Miscellaneous: 10ac.


A range of outbuildings are situated to the south of the main house. There is a combination of traditional and modern construction, which provide accommodation for livestock and general-purpose storage.
