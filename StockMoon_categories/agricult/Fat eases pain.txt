  Fat eases painPolyunsaturated  fatty acids (pufas) have scored yet another point in the "which is better" contest with monounsaturated acids (mufas)--and this time as a painkiller.

While  pufas  are found in fish oil, soybean, corn, cottonseed, sesame and sunflower oil, dietary sources of  mufas, are not far behind with must-eats:   olive, canola oil, avocados, peanuts, nuts and seeds. Studies have encouraged the intake of both with high levels of benefits. The present study found that resolvins, compounds derived naturally from omega-3-fatty acids (pufas),  can mitigate pain caused by inflammatory diseases such as arthritis. Add this to the list of lowering blood cholesterol, reducing risk of heart attacks by slowing plaque and blood clot formation by omega-3 fatty acids alone and  pufas emerge the winners. This was published online on April 11 in  Nature Medicine.

Ru-Rong Ji and colleagues from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School at Boston in  usa  injected resolvins RvE1 and RvD1 into the spinal cord of affected mice at very low doses (0.3-20 nanogramme). The mice were found to overcome inflammation subsequent to treatment.  

Present treatment for inflammatory pain involves use of either opioids or  cox  (cycloxygenase) inhibitors.  cox  is an enzyme that helps cells release a biological mediator   at sites of injury to cause inflammation.   "cox  inhibitors increase chances of gastric and duodenal ulcers and renal complications," said S K Kulkarni, pharmacology professor at Panjab University in Chandigarh. A glaring example is the increase in cardiovascular complications which led to withdrawal of Rofecoxib from the market by Merck and Company, the US-headquartered pharmaceutical, on September 30, 2004.   "Opioids can lead to addiction," he added. 

Ru-Rong Ji believes the resolvins "will prove more potent than other painkillers and yield long-term benefits to patients."Polyunsaturated  fatty acids (pufas) have scored yet another point in the "which is better" contest with monounsaturated acids (mufas)--and this time as a painkiller.While  pufas  are found in fish oil, soybean, corn, cottonseed, sesame and sunflower oil, dietary sources of  mufas, are not far behind with must-eats:   olive, canola oil, avocados, peanuts, nuts and seeds.
