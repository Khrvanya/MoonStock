Safety comes first
When taking a photo of livestock, always remember that safety comes first. Please be extremely careful when taking your CalfLife images.
Remember to be very careful around calves when cows are present. Animals can be unpredictable so take your shots from behind a gate or barrier. Even the quietest cow can attack if she feels her calf is in danger.
How the competition works
Get your entries in before the closing date this Sunday, March 23.
After the closing date, a public vote on will open on the Glanbia Agribusiness Facebook page.
There will be 1 overall winner of the competition and 10 runners up.
