First cases of African swine fever discovered in VietnamAfrican swine fever (ASF) has apparently been discovered for the first time in Vietnam on three farms in recent times.
Located in the Hung Yen and Thai Binh provinces, to the south-east of Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, pigs on all three farms have been culled, according to international media outlet Reuters.
"The disease is not infectious for humans, so people and farmers shouldn't panic," Pham Van Dong, head of the department, reportedly told a press conference in Hanoi.
"Consumers can continue to use (pork) products and shouldn't boycott these products," Dong said.
