Forestry industry to double supplies by 2035 – FIIThe Irish forestry industry is forecast to double its supply of raw material by 2035, compared to its 2017 levels, according to the newly-established Forest Industries Ireland.
Forest Industries Ireland (FII), the new trade association for the forestry and timber industries, was officially launched today (Wednesday, January 9) in the Merrion Hotel Dublin.
FII
A new business sector within Ibec, almost all of the major forestry and timber companies in Ireland are members of FII, drawn from across the industry. These include the largest timber processors as well as companies involved in the establishment and management of forests.
Stemming from this forecast growth by 2035, the industry estimates:

The doubling of industry's combined turnover from EUR800 million today to EUR1.6 billion by 2035;
The creation of an additional 6,000 rural jobs on top of the 12,000 jobs already driven by the industry;
A sizeable increase in the economic contribution of the sector from today's EUR2.3 billion per annum;
21,000 forest owners who supply the raw timber product - as well as the many timber contractors and hauliers that harvest and transport it to the sawmills - will earn an estimated EUR6.4 billion, which is a further boost to rural economies, according to the association.Forest Industries Ireland (FII), the new trade association for the forestry and timber industries, was officially launched today (Wednesday, January 9) in the Merrion Hotel Dublin.
