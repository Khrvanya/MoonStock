GRAINS-Soybeans edge higher after hitting 2-month low amid virus scare2 Min ReadSYDNEY, Feb 3 (Reuters) - U.S. soybeans edged up on Monday after hitting a two-month low earlier in the session as fears that an outbreak of coronavirus will reduce demand from top consumer China. * Market sentiment was buoyed after China's central bank unexpectedly lowered the interest rates on reverse repurchase agreements by 10 basis points on Monday, as authorities stepped up measures to relieve pressure on the economy from a rapidly spreading virus outbreak. * The death toll from the new coronavirus in China's Hubei province rose by 56 to 350 on Monday, Chinese state television reported citing official figures, as investors braced for volatility when Chinese markets reopen after the Lunar New Year break. * The most active soybean futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade were up 0.2% at $8.74-1/2 a bushel, as of 0207 GMT.
