Gardai appeal for info following implement theftGardai are investigating the theft of a log-splitter in recent times and have appealed for information on the matter.
The implement was stolen from Bengour West, Newcestown, Co. Cork on Saturday, January 9, according to a spokesperson for An Garda Siochana.
"The log-splitter would have to have been towed away when it was stolen," the representative added.
If anyone has any information or may have been offered to buy a log-splitter over the last few weeks, we would ask that they contact Bandon Garda Station on: 023-885-2200.
Meanwhile, last week Gardai issued an appeal for information following the theft of a trailer and two ride-on lawns from the midlands.

"During the night of February 23/24, 2019, two John Deere ride-on lawnmowers were stolen in the Rhode area. Also stolen was an Ivor Williams Tuff trailer.
"This trailer is double axle, 8X4, with Peter Hosey's name written on it.
