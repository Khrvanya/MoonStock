Glanbia releases milk prices for February suppliesFollowing today's milk price by Lakeland, Glanbia has become the second processor to announce its prices for its February supplies.
Glanbia will pay its member milk suppliers 31.5c/L, including VAT, for February manufacturing milk supplies at 3.6% butterfat and 3.3% protein, down from last month's figure of 32c/L.
Glanbia Ireland (GI) has maintained its base milk price for February at 30c/L, including VAT, for manufacturing milk at 3.6% fat and 3.3% protein, which it says is "in line with current market returns".
GI will also make an interim market payment of 1c/L (including VAT) on all February milk supplies (excluding Fixed Milk Price Schemes paying above 31c/L).
Glanbia Co-op will make a support payment to members of 0.5c/L, including VAT.
"Brexit uncertainty has led to short-term changes in purchasing patterns. Protein prices have improved, but market returns have not recovered from the reduction in butter prices over recent months," said chairman Martin Keane.
For the last three months - reflecting January, December and November milk prices -  the processor has offered 32c/L, including VAT, for manufacturing milk supplies at 3.6% butterfat and 3.3% protein.
