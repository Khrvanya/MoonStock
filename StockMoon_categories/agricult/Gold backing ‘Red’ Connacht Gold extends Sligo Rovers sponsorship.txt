Karen McGarty, communications and brand manager for Aurivo, said: "We are delighted to continue our relationship with Sligo Rovers through our sponsorship of the Bit O'Red Under 19 side again this year.

Welcoming the sponsorship renewal, Martin Heraghty, Sligo Rovers chairman, said:
"In preparation for this announcement and looking back on the beginning of the partnership with Aurivo and the Connacht Gold brand, we then had a number of emerging players in the under 19 side including Jack Keaney, John Mahon and Ed McGinty - all three players are established players on the squad now and we are seeing even more talent coming through on the team.
The partnership is supporting our players pathway for future success and it is vital for Sligo Rovers to have sponsors such as Aurivo's Connacht Gold brand to help fund the academy team.
"We have five academy teams - four male and one female - and they all have aspiring players who are committed to moving up to senior football.
"There is a huge sense of community with this sponsorship deal and we are delighted to have Aurivo's Connacht Gold as our official sponsors of the Under 19 side again this year, which will help us continue to develop our underage team," Heraghty concluded.
