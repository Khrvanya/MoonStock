Grain price Rapeseed reaches highest price since March 2017Paris rapeseed futures reached their highest price since March 2017 this week. On Tuesday (January 7), the price closed at EUR416.50/t - the highest since March 2017.

New crop wheat gaining in the UK
Nearby LIFFE wheat hasn't moved any big amounts since the end of last week.
However, November wheat in the UK is bridging a gap. On Friday morning, January 10, new crop wheat (November) was trading at PS162.45/t. That was PS8.45/t ahead of May which was trading at PS154.00/t.
The chart below from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) shows the spread between the prices.
The new crop premium can be at least partly attributed to a fear of a smaller UK crop following a wet winter which saw less winter crops planted.

Further a field, the first Brazilian maize crop of the year is approximately a month away from harvest in February and soil moisture levels have been at a five-year low since September.
Planted area had increased in Brazil and projections were for a rise in production. As supplies may now tighten this may help to increase prices in the region and in turn have an impact on other markets.
