Grain price Wheat drifting downwardsWheat prices drifted downwards this week on LIFFE, MATIF and Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) markets. In fact CBOT wheat went from a high of 566.75c/bu on February 18 to 529.25c/bu on February 27 - a drop of 37.5c/bu.
Concerns over the coronavirus were no doubt having an impact on markets, while large production estimates for the season ahead also played a role.
The spread of the virus to Europe has impacted on markets as traders take into account the effect it may have on consumers' habits, as well as the effect on logistics.
Milder winter
Looking at grain production in the Black Sea, a milder winter has allowed crops to avoid frost kill and the amount of grain available for export is expected to rise.
Those exports are already up on last season. Ukraine grain exports are up by 23% so far - at 40 million tonnes. Wheat exports have reached 15.6 million tonnes and according to some reports may finish at 20 million tonnes.
Russian wheat exports are expected to reach 32.2 million tonnes. Exports for July to January were down 17% at 21.8 million tonnes (January 23).
