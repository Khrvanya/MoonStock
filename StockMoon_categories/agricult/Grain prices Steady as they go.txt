Grain prices Steady as they goMarkets remained steady this week and while prices dropped slightly, this drop wasn't significant and really just added to the bumpy line that has developed in markets over the past few weeks.
Around the world
Increase in winter plantings
Reports from Ukraine show an increase in the winter crop area planted. 8.945 million hectares are estimated to have been planted to winter crops this season, an increase of 7.5% on last year.

Harvest rolls on in the southern hemisphere
In Argentina, the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange reported that as of January 9, 89.7% of the soybean crop had been planted out of a projected 17.9 million hectares. Corn planting is estimated to be 82.7% complete and projected to reach 5.8 million hectares.
