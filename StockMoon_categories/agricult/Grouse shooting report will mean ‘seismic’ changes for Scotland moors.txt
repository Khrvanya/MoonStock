Grouse shooting report will mean ‘seismic’ changes for Scotland moorsRural organisations have warned that recommendations made by a Government-commissioned review of grouse moor management will cause a "seismic" change for grouse moors across Scotland.
Following the publication of the review group's report, a joint statement was issued by: The British Association for Shooting and Conservation; the Scottish Countryside Alliance; the Scottish Gamekeepers' Association; the Scottish Association for Country Sports; and the Scottish Land and Estates.
The statement said: "The recommendations of the Werritty Review will mean a seismic change for grouse moors across Scotland."
Fear of red tape
The statement by rural organisations added: "This report has recommended a barrage of measures that will leave the grouse shooting sector engulfed by legislation and red tape. On top of that, penalties for wildlife crime in Scotland are about to get much tougher.
"The sector has already willingly embraced change and improvements in how it operates.
"We believe further enhanced training and codes of practice covering muirburn, mountain hare management and medicated grit are the best solution rather than onerous licensing provisions and we will be seeking an urgent meeting with Government to discuss these key areas.
The review group has recognised that there is no case for the banning of driven grouse shooting. They also accepted that licensing of grouse moors in general is hugely contentious, complex and unnecessary at this time. Nor is there scientific evidence to justify such a measure.
"Should it be introduced in the future, it would push an important rural business sector beyond breaking point.

"Grouse shooting plays a vital role in helping to sustain communities and delivers multiple social, economic and environmental benefits. It would be a tragedy if the massive private investment that underpins these benefits is put at risk by a package of regulatory measures that will herald fundamental change.
Raptor persecution
"Scotland already has the most stringent laws to deal with raptor persecution in the UK and they're about to get even tougher with proposed jail sentences of up to five years and wide-ranging new financial penalties - which we support.
"There has been huge progress in recent years to combat raptor persecution and incidents are now at historically low levels.
"We are committed to playing our part to help eradicate the problem but are deeply concerned that law-abiding rural businesses will be buried under an avalanche of regulation and added costs as a result of this review. That may well force people out of business and put families' livelihoods at risk.
At a time when climate change and the environment is of paramount importance, we take great pride in the environmental and conservation contribution made by grouse moors through carbon capture and the careful management of Scotland's much-loved heather clad landscape.
"Inflicting an even greater burden on moorland managers would jeopardise this.
"We welcome the fact that the review recommends greater transparency and independence around the satellite-tagging of birds of prey. However, its proposals do not go far enough in seeking to create an open and accountable system," the statement concluded.
