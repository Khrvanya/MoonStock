HGV ‘on hold’ over improper restraintsGardai stopped a heavy goods vehicle (HGV) carrying an articulated dumper which apparently did not have adequate restraints to ensure it was properly secured.
The lorry was stopped between the M8 and N24 routes in Co. Tipperary earlier today (Thursday, January 24).
Upon closer inspection, members of An Garda Siochana subsequently found that the driver of the vehicle in question did not have a permit to transport the hefty plant machinery in question.
It was also found that the lorry had defective tyres. The luckless driver was given a court summons to contend with, Gardai confirmed.
Revealing the incident on social media, the An Garda Siochana Tipperary Facebook account stated: "Gardai in Cahir stopped this HGV carrying an unsecured load on the M8.
The driver didn't have a permit to carry the load and the tyres had defects.
"The vehicle was grounded, with court to follow," the statement added.
