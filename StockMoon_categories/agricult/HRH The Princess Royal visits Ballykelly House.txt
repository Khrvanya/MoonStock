The Princess Royal viewed the department's new PS21 million building that boasts the latest technologies and takes an innovative approach to multi-site working.
New headquarters
The proposal to relocate the then Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) headquarters was first announced in 2011 as one of four projects to move Civil Service jobs out of Belfast.
The move to relocate to Ballykelly House was a flagship project and the first time a Government Department moved its headquarters to a rural area, with the intention of stimulating rural economies.
