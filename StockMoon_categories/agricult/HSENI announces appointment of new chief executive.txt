HSENI announces appointment of new chief executiveThe Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland (HSENI) has announced the appointment of Robert Kidd as its new chief. Kidd took over the role on Monday (January 28).
He joins HSENI from the Department of Justice Firearms and Explosives Branch where he has worked since 2011.
Robert Kidd started his career in the Police Authority before moving to the NI Statistics & Research Agency. Following this, he worked in the regional development office of the Department of Social Development.
Farming's track record
With one of the worst safety records of any industry, it's likely farming will be one of the areas to come under the scrutiny of the new chief executive.
A report published by HSENI last year highlighted that on average around 100 farm accidents occur every month in the region - a figure which only included incidents in which medical attention had been required.
