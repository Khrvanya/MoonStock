Heifers sell to a top price of ˆ1,600head at Ballinrobe MartCattle numbers were reported to have increased at Ballinrobe Mart on Wednesday last, January 16. A good trade was reported - especially for the quality lots on offer.
Tom Maguire - the mart's manager - said: "The trade has followed the pre-Christmas period, with the emphasis very much on quality.
"Anything 'nice' is making plenty and anything plain is a bad trade - the very same as before Christmas. We had 100 cattle here on Wednesday and that would be typical for this time of the year.
"There is a degree of uncertainty about the whole suckler and beef game. Having said that, quality cattle are still achieving high prices."
