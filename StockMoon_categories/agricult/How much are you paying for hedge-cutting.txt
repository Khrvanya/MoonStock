How much are you paying for hedge-cuttingFarmers have until the end of February to carry out hedge-cutting on their land.
As ground stands in relatively good order, many may be looking at cutting remaining hedges or some that may have been left on the long finger before now.
In this short article, we provide a quick glimpse of a selection of prices (charge-out rates) being touted (in advertisements) around the country. These figures are simply those that were observed at the time of writing.
In Co. Cork, EUR40/hour (plus VAT) is being charged for a flail hedge-cutter. This was also the case in counties Laois and Meath, while a price of EUR42/hour (including VAT) was quoted in Co. Tipperary.
