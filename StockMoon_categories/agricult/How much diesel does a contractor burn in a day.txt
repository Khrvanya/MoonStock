How much diesel does a contractor burn in a dayThe Association of Farm & Forestry Contractors in Ireland (FCI) recently published a document that detailed fuel (diesel) usage for a number of high-profile contracting activities.
Based on research carried out by the organisation, the figures suggest that a contractor cutting and ensiling pit silage (with all the associated equipment) typically uses 3,050L/day.
That's based on the following (pit silage) assumptions:

Self-propelled forage harvester - 1,000L/day;
Loader and mower (combined) - 800L/day;
Five tractors and trailers (each) - 250L/day;
Total - 3,050L/day.Based on research carried out by the organisation, the figures suggest that a contractor cutting and ensiling pit silage (with all the associated equipment) typically uses 3,050L/day.
