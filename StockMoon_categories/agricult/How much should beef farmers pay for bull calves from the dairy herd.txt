How much should beef farmers pay for bull calves from the dairy herdIreland's dairy-beef industry has found itself propelled into the fast lane. Since the quotas were abolished in 2015, the national dairy herd has increased in size.
As a result, there has been a proportional increase in the number of dairy calves coming on stream for beef production.
Therefore, as calving kicks into gear on many dairy farms across the country, many beef farmers - who operate dairy-beef systems - will be in the market for calves over the coming weeks.
Speaking at an event in Co. Kilkenny last night (Tuesday, January 15), Teagasc's head of Drystock Knowledge Transfer Pearse Kelly outlined that there is money to be made from these systems; but advised farmers to proceed with caution when it comes to the price they are paying for calves.
Looking back over the last eight years, Pearse highlighted that there are 40% more calves being born in the dairy herd now than there were in 2010.
However, there are beef x dairy calves being born too. And, if we compare 2018 to 2010, there is a 72% or 275,000 head increase in the number of these calves coming on stream.
Pearse outlined that these are relatively low-cost systems to get into.
"Farmers could go out and buy 50 calves for very small money, but you will very quickly spend EUR50,000 on those 50 calves; but they can be profitable when you hit key performance targets."
Profitable calf-to-beef system:

Excellent management required from start to finish;
High output required;
Excellent calf-rearing skills;
Good health and vaccination plan;
Excellent quality silage required;
Weight gain from grass maximised;
Meet weight for age and market specs;
Pay an appropriate price for calf.As a result, there has been a proportional increase in the number of dairy calves coming on stream for beef production.
