IFA to begin ‘peer-to-peer’ farm safety initiativeThe Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) is to roll out a 'peer-to-peer' farm safety initiative in 2019, which the association says will see farmers "undertake practical measures that will reduce the risk on their own farm".
The IFA will use the branch structures within its 29 county executives to implement the programme, which will feature groups of farmers coming together to emphasise farm safety issues.
These groups, which will consist of between three and five members, will meet in a particular farm in that group, where they will discuss any "near miss" that had taken place in the previous 12 to 18 months.
The groups will then inspect the farm, focusing on particular safety areas.

The IFA has decided that these farm safety groups will focus on the following areas:


                            // googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1511797470075-0'); });
