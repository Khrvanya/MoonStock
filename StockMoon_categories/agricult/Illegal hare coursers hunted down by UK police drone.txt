Drones
In Ireland, back in November, 43 Civil Defence volunteers completed a drone pilot training programme. This brought the total number of trained pilots up to 60 in the Civil Defence in 20 operational units across the country.
In particular, drones have assisted Civil Defence volunteers when An Garda Siochana has requested support from Civil Defence.
Coursing
Hare coursing under proper regulation is legal in Ireland and is administered by the Irish Coursing Club (ICC) which is a body set up under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958, according to the National Parks and Wildlife Service.
Legal provisions for coursing enable the regulatory authorities to control coursing and reduce the attraction of illegal, unregulated coursing activity.
It is important to note that all greyhounds are muzzled during these coursing events, according to the service.
