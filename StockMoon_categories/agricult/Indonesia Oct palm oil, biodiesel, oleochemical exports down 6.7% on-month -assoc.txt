Indonesia Oct palm oil, biodiesel, oleochemical exports down 6.7% on-month -assoc1 Min ReadJAKARTA, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Indonesia's palm oil, biodiesel and oleochemical exports fell 6.7% on a monthly basis in October to 3.04 million tonnes, the Indonesian Palm Oil Association (GAPKI) said in a statement on Monday. "CPO (crude palm oil) production in October was lower than September's which we suspect was due to below normal rate of rainfall," the group said, adding that domestic consumption rose. This resulted in a slight drop in stock of palm oil to 3.71 million tonnes at the end of October, from 3.73 million tonnes at end-September, it added.
