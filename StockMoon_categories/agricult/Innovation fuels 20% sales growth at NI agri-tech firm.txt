The deal allowed the group to manufacture goods closer to some of its key export markets. The move is also expected to drive future growth.
Devenish also reached a significant milestone in August 2018 when the firm completed a refinancing of its business through a long-term funding package that will underwrite its research and development programme and support growth across the group.
The package included a pioneering facility of EUR40 million - the largest ever support for agri-business in Ireland by the European Investment Bank.
