The walls are of stone construction with a corrugated roof and there is mains electricity passing over the lands.

There would be a good possibility of local housing needs, what with site potential and the necessary constraints in place.
Further information
The purchaser will be required to fence the western boundary which extends to approximately 110m within four weeks of completion and before any stock is placed on the land.
Commenting on the market, Luke said: "It would be local farmers / young farmers who are looking to avail of grants that will have interest in these lands.

"With the 21ac and the old cottage/barn, someone may look to create a small holding, renovate the existing barn or apply for planning to extend/rebuild."
The property is for sale by auction on March 15 at 2:00pm at Peacockes Hotel, Maam Cross, Co. Galway. The guide price is EUR40,000.
