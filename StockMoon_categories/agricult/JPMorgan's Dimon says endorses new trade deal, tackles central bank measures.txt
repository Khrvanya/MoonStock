JPMorgan's Dimon says endorses new trade deal, tackles central bank measures1 Min ReadWASHINGTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The head of the Business Roundtable trade group of top U.S. chief executives said on Wednesday that he endorses the revised U.S. Mexico Canada (USMCA) trade deal after top negotiators brought the hard-won agreement across the finish on Tuesday. The nod of the deal by Jamie Dimon, chief executive at JPMorgan and head of the Business Roundtable, comes one day after the leaders of the three countries signed the overhaul of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which labor unions, industry groups, lawmakers and even environmental groups fought hard to improve.
