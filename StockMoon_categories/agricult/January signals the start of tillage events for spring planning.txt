January signals the start of tillage events for spring planningJanuary is a busy month for tillage events as farmers prepare for the season ahead. Planning is essential and these events will provide information on margins, varieties, grain price and different agronomic practices.
An added benefit is that many of these events qualify as Knowledge Transfer (KT) events.
Farmers who are part of a Knowledge Transfer group may attend two national events, which can then be used as attendance for two knowledge transfer meetings.
Teagasc Spring Tillage Seminars
The spring seminars will cover: crop planning and margins; spring cereal varieties and sowing rates; crop nutrition to achieve savings; and integrated pest management (IPM).
Attendees are advised to check with their advisor or KT facilitator before the event to ensure that it is an approved KT event.
