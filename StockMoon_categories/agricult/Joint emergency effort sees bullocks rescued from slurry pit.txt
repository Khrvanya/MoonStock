"Last night Fermoy Gardai and County Cork Fire Service from Mallow came to the aid of a farmer who had 12 bullocks trapped in a slurry pit.
The 'steaks' were high, so we were happy to help. Neighbours, guards and firefighters rolled up their sleeves and rescued all the animals.
"After this, it was back to the 'calfeteria' to warm up. We all need a dig-out occasionally, we get our best outcomes when people work together.

Getting one last play on words in, the Gardai concluded: "We won't overdo the puns, because you've 'herd' them before."
'Different type of rescue'
Cork County Fire Service also commented on the incident over social media, adding: "Mallow Fire Brigade were called out to a different type of rescue last night.
"Thankfully all animals were rescued successfully."
