Knackery gate fees range from ˆ10 to ˆ130 nationwideA recent survey has revealed that the cost of removing fallen animals off the farmyard can range from EUR10 for a calf in Co. Meath to EUR130 for a two to four year old animal in Co. Clare.
The survey was conducted by the Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) and all fees quoted include collection.
Commenting on the survey, the IFA animal health chairman, Pat Farrell, said the cost variation highlights the impact a lack of competition is having in some areas.
He added that this is exposing farmers to exorbitant and unjustified charges.
Average costs for collection of fallen animals are as follows:
