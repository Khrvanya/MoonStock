"The global dairy markets have shown signs of solidity in recent weeks and, as a result, Lakeland Dairies is in a position to pass on improved returns directly to our 3,200 farm families.
While sentiment in the market has improved, particularly for powders, there continues to be market uncertainty around the shape of a trade deal between the UK and the EU as well as ongoing trade and geo-political tensions.
"Lakeland Dairies will continue to monitor the market situation closely over the coming weeks," the spokesperson concluded.
Other milk processors are expected to announce their respective prices for December over the coming days and weeks.
