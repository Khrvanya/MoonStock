Lakeland increases milk price for January suppliesLakeland Dairies has become the latest processor to announce its milk price for January supplies, deciding to increase its price following a board meeting today, Thursday, February 13.
In the Republic of Ireland, a base price of 31.81c/L including VAT and lactose bonus will be paid for milk supplied in January
The base price has been increased by 0.5c/L. Qualifying farmers will also receive the usual out-of-season payment, the processor has said.
In Northern Ireland, a base price of 25.25p/L will be paid for January supplies. The base price has been increased 0.25p/L.
Commenting on the price, a co-op spokesperson said:
"While European and US milk production has returned to growth in recent months, the global dairy market fundamentals are reasonable with supply and demand pretty well balanced. However, there is a growing concern in the market on the back of the coronavirus.
Over the past month, sentiment in China has become weaker as authorities there move to get a handle on the virus. This has resulted in a slowing of consumer sentiment and distribution channels.
"Lakeland Dairies will continue to monitor the market situation closely over the coming weeks," the co-op spokesperson concluded.

Meanwhile, yesterday, Kerry Group decided to hold its offering from last month.
The group has set a price of 31.5c/L including VAT. Based on January milk solids, the price return is expected to be 36.1c/L, the processor said.

That payment was paid in the middle of last month, and was calculated based on average annual milk supply for 2015 to 2019 inclusive.
