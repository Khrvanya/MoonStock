Lamb retail sales up 8.1% as production hits peakSales of fresh and frozen lamb have grown strongly in the last three months, AHDB has revealed. However, prices continue to follow the five-year average, falling at a prime time of year in production.
Kantar data for the 12 weeks to August 11 shows sales grew by 8.1% in volume, compared to the same period last year.
Recent unsettled weather was said to have helped boost sales of roasting cuts, which were shunned by consumers during last year's heatwave, and historically have helped the lamb category.
Additionally, the volume of lamb purchased per buyer increased by 5% year-on-year, with the average UK household buying 1.5kg of lamb in the last quarter.
AHDB Beef and Lamb strategy director Will Jackson said: "The increased retail sales results will be welcome news to sheep producers.
As temperatures are cooling, there's potential that more British shoppers will turn to hearty lamb dishes to warm themselves into the autumn.
"And, although Love Lamb Week has drawn to a close, the September phase of our lamb marketing campaign will continue to support lamb sales in our country."

This week, the Standard Quality Quotation (SQQ) fell by 7.8p/kg in GB, mainly down to a 22.2% increase in the number slaughtered as lamb season gets into full swing.
Farm-assured lambs fetched 168.8p/kg and non-assured managed 164.3p/kg.
Similarly, cull ewe prices fell by PS3.31/head compared to the week before. The price is currently following five-year trends.
In June, sheepmeat imports were down by 36% and exports were up by 35%, partly due to less meat coming from New Zealand.
