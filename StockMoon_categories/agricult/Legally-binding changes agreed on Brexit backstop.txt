Legally-binding changes agreed on Brexit backstopThe European Commission and the UK have agreed new measures on the Irish backstop following last-minute talks between President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker and UK Prime Minister Theresa May.
The talks were held in Strasbourg last night in an effort to avoid a no-deal scenario and the UK crashing out of the EU with no agreement.
Announced at 11:00pm last night (Monday, March 11), the package of measures outlines three legally-binding changes.
These are:

A legal instrument interpreting the Irish protocol which has "legal force and a binding character";
A joint statement reinforcing the political declaration on the future EU-UK relationship which underlines both sides' efforts to negotiate a free trade agreement quickly, and to work towards alternative arrangements like technology to replace the backstop;
A "unilateral declaration" by the UK that, if the backstop comes into effect, negotiations break down and there is no hope of agreement, the UK can "instigate measures" that could ultimately "dis-apply" the backstop.The talks were held in Strasbourg last night in an effort to avoid a no-deal scenario and the UK crashing out of the EU with no agreement.
