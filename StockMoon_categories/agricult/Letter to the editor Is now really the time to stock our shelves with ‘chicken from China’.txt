Letter to the editor Is now really the time to stock our shelves with ‘chicken from China’To my utter disbelief, I discovered during recent days that chicken is being imported from China and sold in some major retailers [here in Ireland].
I was shocked to see chicken from China for sale in local stores - in Co. Laois. This chicken, I can only guess, must be virtually untraceable. It makes no sense on any level.
The link between poultry and its ability to carry disease and viruses is undeniable. When you factor in the current outbreak of Covid-19, which appears to have originated in China, how is this acceptable?
Why would we take such an unjustifiable risk with our national bio-security at this time?I was shocked to see chicken from China for sale in local stores - in Co. Laois. This chicken, I can only guess, must be virtually untraceable. It makes no sense on any level.
