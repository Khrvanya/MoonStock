Livestock unit for sale promises productivity and scenic beautyHillhead of Catter Farm is a productive and commercial livestock unit set amidst the beauty of the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park.
The land covering 543.4ac is for sale by Galbraith. The property includes an extensive range of farm buildings and a beautiful three-bedroom traditional farmhouse.
It is located only one mile from the popular village of Croftamie to the east. The village of Drymen, 2.5 miles to the north, offers an excellent range of local amenities. Glasgow is 17 miles to the south east.
Spectacular setting
The expansive and picturesque farmland at Hillhead of Catter is classified by The James Hutton Institute as Grade 3.2, with some smaller areas of Grade 4.1 and Grade 5.
"This is an excellent commercial livestock unit situated in a spectacular setting within the national park, an area nationally and internationally renowned for the beauty of its scenery," said a partner with Galbraith Duncan Barrie.
"The farm is for sale as a whole, or in two lots, and as result we expect the holding to appeal to local farming operations keen to expand, but also to buyers from further afield looking to relocate to this beautiful part of the country and run a commercial beef and sheep enterprise," he said.
