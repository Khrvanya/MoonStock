Lung Guard Have you the best defence against calf respiratory disordersAuctus has included a new respiratory additive into its powerful range of Calf Milk Replacers. Lung Guard has been added as an optional extra in the Opti-mum and Champion products.
Auctus Calf Milk Replacers
All Auctus Calf Milk Replacers, as standard, have the inclusion of:
Triple Shield Protection - which increases the growth of intestinal micro flora, reduces the incidence of digestive scours and minimises the growth of harmful bacteria including e-coli, clostridia and salmonella;
Sodium Butyrate - which acts as a stomach buffer in the abomasum, giving further protection against harmful bacteria and pathogens such as cryptosporidium and coccidiosis; and
An extremely strong vitamin and mineral inclusion to push calf development when the calf's genetic function is being layed down within the first six months of life.
Lung guard
Lung Guard, however, will even strengthen these products further to help counter respiratory disorders.
Respiratory distress can be detected in 20% of animals and is caused due to: environmental reasons in buildings with ventilation and weather issues; or stress resulting in an impact on the immune system.
Calves or ruminants tend to be sensitive to respiratory disorders due to low pulmonary volume and low immunity as baby animals.
