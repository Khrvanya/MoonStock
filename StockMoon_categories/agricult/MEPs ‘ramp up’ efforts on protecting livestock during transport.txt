MEPs ‘ramp up’ efforts on protecting livestock during transportThe European Parliament has voted in favour of renewing the EU law on protecting livestock during transport.
It was outlined that the law is currently being poorly applied only in some of the EU states.
The MEPs agreed that unannounced and risk-based checks should be emphasised and tougher penalties should be imposed on people for non compliance.
Some of the suggestions from MEPs included minimising transport time and emphasis on transport of carcasses rather than live animals.
The Parliament made calls for the EU Commission to  impose penalties on member states that fail to apply EU rules correctly. Penalties mentioned included confiscating vehicles and compulsory retraining for staff.
