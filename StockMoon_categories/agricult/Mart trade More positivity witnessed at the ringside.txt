Mart trade More positivity witnessed at the ringsideA more positive atmosphere is surrounding the mart trade in recent weeks, with a good demand from farmers sourcing cattle for pasture due to the large availability of grass and favourable conditions in some parts.
Weanling prices have continued in the right direction and this has been welcomed by farmers. While lots suitable for further feeding are popular, so too are the lighter weanlings.
Mart managers have described the cull cow trade as steady, with top-quality lots coming in just shy of the EUR2.00/kg mark.
However - on the other hand - the trade for plainer, lesser-quality cattle remains sluggish.
Tullow Mart
According to the mart's manager, Eric Driver, the trade was positive in Tullow Mart on Friday last, February 8. He also noted that there was plenty of demand around the ring for forward store-type animals.
Friesian cull cows sold in the region of EUR1.00-250 over, while continental cows were reported to be a slightly easier trade. Feeder cows sold for EUR150 over to a top of EUR500 along with the weight.
Looking at the bullock trade, forward store Hereford and Angus lots sold for EUR190 along with the weight; EUR2.10-2.15/kg was paid for some of the younger continental bullocks. Friesian bullocks were reported to sell in the region of EUR1.75/kg.
Lighter continental bullocks weighing in excess of 400kg made EUR2.00-2.25/kg, while "exceptional" steers made up to EUR2.45/kg.
Hereford and Angus forward and beef heifers sold for EUR1.85-1.90/kg and up to EUR2.20/kg for good continental lots. Plainer Angus and Hereford store heifers sold in the region of EUR1.75/kg.
In the calf ring, a steady trade was reported with shipping calves making EUR50-90/head. Some "well-reared" Friesian calves made EUR120-140/head. Some of the lighter Friesian calves sold from a base of EUR25/head.
Eric also noted that continental heifer calves made EUR210-350/head, with some "exceptional" bulls making in excess of EUR350/head; Hereford and Angus heifers made EUR120-200/head, while bulls were reported to sell for EUR270-280/head.
Kilkenny Mart
A sale - consisting of 550 animals - was witnessed in Kilkenny Mart, Cillin Hill on Thursday last, according to the mart's auctioneer, George Candler.
He said: "The presence of more buyers resulted in a lift in prices all round. Most lots were increased by EUR20-40/head compared to last week, with some quality continentals increased by EUR50/head as opposed to last week's returns.
