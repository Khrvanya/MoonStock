Mart trade Upward momentum continues for quality stockThe mart trade has continued its upward momentum in recent days. This is especially the case for the quality lots on offer.
Good grass growth and favourable weather conditions have continued in some parts and this is having a positive effect at the ringside.
As has been the case in recent weeks, the number of cattle presented for sale has increased. Mart managers have noted there has been an increased demand for weanling bulls which require further feeding.
In addition, mart managers reported a steady trade for cull cows, with some lots breaking the EUR2.00/kg mark.

A sale - consisting of 880 animals - was witnessed in Kilkenny Mart, Cillin Hill on Thursday last, according to the mart's auctioneer, George Candler.
He said: "The trade is remarkably firm especially when you consider the uncertain climate we find ourselves in.
