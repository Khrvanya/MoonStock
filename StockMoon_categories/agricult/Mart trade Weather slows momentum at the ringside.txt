Mart trade Weather slows momentum at the ringsideThe recent spell of wet weather has slowed the positive momentum that was present at the ringside - but only just.
While mart managers have outlined that weather has had a negative impact in recent days, the trade is best described as steady.
Cows still remain in a good position, while both short-keep bullocks and heifers are a good trade; however, the trade for weanlings has eased in recent days.
