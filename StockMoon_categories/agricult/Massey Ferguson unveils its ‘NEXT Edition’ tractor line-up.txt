Massey Ferguson unveils its ‘NEXT Edition’ tractor line-upMassey Ferguson will launch its new 'NEXT Edition' tractors at Agritechnica 2019 in Germany next month. They are described as "high-specification" models.
'NEXT Edition' specification will be available on four Massey Ferguson models - the 110hp 5711 S Dyna-4; the 130hp 5713 S Dyna-4; the 200hp 7720 S Dyna-VT; and the 255hp 7726 S Dyna-VT.

These special-edition tractors combine elements of the 5700 S Essential and 7700 S Exclusive packages with "further features".
"We just simply looked at our customers' needs in these segments - considering our best-selling tractors, as well as the preferred options, equipment and transmissions," said Francesco Quaranta, vice-president of the Sales & Marketing division (Massey Ferguson Europe & Middle East).
"These tractors have a unique 'NEXT Edition' emblem on the bonnet, as well as an exclusive plate inside, which shows its special-edition build number.
The 'NEXT Edition' models come in the iconic MF red colour, but with distinctive black grilles. Alternatively, you can choose a full black livery for the same price.
He added: "The two new 5700 S Dyna-4 'NEXT Edition' models have an increased specification [over standard 'Essential' models].
