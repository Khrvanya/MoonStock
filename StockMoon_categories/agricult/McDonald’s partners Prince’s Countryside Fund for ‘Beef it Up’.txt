McDonald’s partners Prince’s Countryside Fund for ‘Beef it Up’McDonald's UK has entered into a three-year partnership with the Prince's Countryside Fund to support family farm economic resilience.
The fund, in conjunction with McDonald's, will be launching the 'Beef It Up' campaign in 2020 -  a series of group workshops aimed at livestock farms in the fund's Farm Resilience Programme alumni network.
These workshops will address topics including: animal health and welfare; farm safety; economic resilience; and environmental management.
The 'Beef it Up' workshops are aimed at helping farms to improve their practices and sustainability performance, by "introducing them to practical steps they can take to immediately make changes to their production systems".
It's hoped that the partnership between McDonald's and the fund will "improve the prospects of family farm businesses across the UK at such a critical time".

"I am thrilled that the Fund will be working again with McDonald's, in order to help us improve the prospects of family farm businesses across the UK at such a critical time," said Claire Saunders, director of The Prince's Countryside Fund.
Meanwhile, Nina Prichard, head of sustainable and ethical sourcing at McDonald's UK & Ireland, commented: "Our supply chain is absolutely critical to our success - we couldn't serve the food that we're famous for without the support and hard work of 23,000 British and Irish farmers.
"This partnership is an important move in supporting them and securing their futures. Farming is part of the fabric of our society, and we are delighted to be working with The Prince's Countryside Fund on this resilience programme," she added.
