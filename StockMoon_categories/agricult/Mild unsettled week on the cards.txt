Mild unsettled week on the cardsA mild, unsettled week is in store for the country, according to Met Eireann.
Today will be mainly dry and bright with good sunny spells, the national meteorological office has forecast.
There are expected to be a few isolated light showers near north-west and north coasts. Highest temperatures will peak at 8deg to 11deg with light or moderate west to north-west breezes.
Early tonight will be cold and dry with clear spells and a sharp frost with some icy patches. Lowest temperatures will drop to -1deg to +3deg.
Around midnight, rain will develop in the south-west and will spread eastwards over much of the country by dawn along with freshening south to south-east winds.
Drying conditions will be generally poor in the week ahead due to frequent bouts of wet and windy weather, while spraying conditions will also be limited with changeable and blustery conditions at times.
Meanwhile, regarding field conditions, all soils are saturated at the moment and some poorly-drained soils are waterlogged.
Some moderate drained soils may become waterlogged at times over the coming week.
Tomorrow
Tomorrow will be cloudy and blustery with outbreaks of rain and fresh, gusty south to south-east winds. The rain will clear eastwards through the late afternoon and evening with clear weather following and winds becoming westerly.
Highest temperatures will hit 10deg to 13deg, according to the forecaster.

A longer spell of rain will affect most areas on Wednesday evening with sleet on hills.
Little change is expected on Thursday, with a similar mix of bright sunny spells and occasional showers - again the showers mainly in the west.
Strong south-west winds will ease during the evening and a slight ground frost may occur overnight.
Then rain and strong south-west winds will spread to all parts during Friday.
The rain will be heavy too with winds gusting to gale force; however, it should stay mainly mild, Met Eireann predicts.
