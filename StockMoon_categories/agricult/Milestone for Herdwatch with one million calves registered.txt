Sandra was the winner of a free 12-month Herdwatch PRO membership, a voucher from its partner in Dovea Genetics, an essentials calving kit from AgriDirect.ie and some Herdwatch goodies thrown in for good mix.
Commenting, Sandra said: "Since we started using Herdwatch in 2018 we have saved a huge amount of time on paperwork."
Herdwatch product owner and Co. Clare native Gearoid Kenny said: "I am very proud to be part of the Herdwatch team, and even more proud that the first calf and the millionth calf were both from Clare!
