The new Minister for Agriculture will be farmer and DUP MLA for Lagan Valley Edwin Poots.
The role of Minister for Justice is being taken up by leader of the Alliance Party Naomi Long.
Meanwhile, DUP representative Diane Dodds has been appointed Minister at the Department for the Economy, while Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy will take up the role of Minister for Finance.
Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) MLA Robin Swann is the new Minister for Health, who will take on a current dispute with health trade unions.
