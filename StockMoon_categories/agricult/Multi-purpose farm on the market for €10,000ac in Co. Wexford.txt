Multi-purpose farm on the market for ˆ10,000ac in Co. WexfordApproximately 155ac has come on the market at Quitchery, Ballymitty, Co. Wexford. The section of land includes a yard, outbuildings and a stone building.
The Ballymitty property is an out farm and was previously in use for beet production. It is currently used for dry stock, grazing and growing maize, said selling agent John Radford of Sherry FitzGerald Radford.
"The owners have a large dairy enterprise in Bannow and have acquired land locally. They are consolidating," he said.
"This property is presented in one block with a very realistic guide price of EUR10,000/ac which is an accurate guideline for the area. The property offers good accessibility, is multi-purpose and can be sold in one or more lots.

"The south Wexford land boasts superb fertility with exceptional facilities along with the derelict stone farmhouse and road/lane network," he said.
