Penalties are incurred by farmers who breach the limits of 170kg of nitrogen per hectare or the limit for those who hold an approved derogation is 250kg of nitrogen per hectare.
Farmers who exceeded the limits or came close to the limits in 2018 should consider applying for a derogation in 2019 which caters for farming to apply livestock manure on a holding (including by the animals themselves) above 170kg N/ha/year up to 250kg N/ha/year, the department representative advised.
