NFU Cymru Welsh Council re-elects president and deputy presidentNFU Cymru president John Davies and deputy president Aled Jones have been re-elected to their roles following a meeting of NFU Cymru's ruling body, Welsh Council.
Davies, a beef and sheep farmer from Powys, and Jones, a dairy farmer from Mid Gwynedd, were unanimously re-elected to their positions for a further two years.
Speaking after his re-election on Tuesday (January 21), NFU Cymru president John Davies said: "There can be little doubt that it has been an eventful last two years for our industry but I have taken great pride in fighting for Wales' farmers during every day of my tenure.
I am under no illusions that huge challenges still face Welsh farming, but I remain committed to lobbying politicians in Cardiff Bay, Westminster and Brussels on the issues that matter to our members - not least bovine TB, water quality and future trade.
"But we also need to be positive and seize the opportunities that come our way. I firmly believe that climate change presents a real opportunity for Welsh farmers to rise to the challenge and become the most climate-friendly food producers in the world."

NFU Cymru deputy president Aled Jones said: "It has been a privilege to serve the NFU Cymru membership over the past two years. One of the most enjoyable elements of my work has been travelling across Wales meeting farmers and hearing the issues that are affecting their businesses and their families.
"I pledge to continue my work over the next two years voicing the concerns and issues raised by our members with politicians, stakeholders, broadcasters and retailers."
The meeting of NFU Cymru Welsh Council also saw the union finalise its wider officeholder team: Wyn Evans, Livestock; Abi Reader, Dairy; Hedd Pugh, Rural Affairs; Kath Whitrow, Less Favoured Area; Andrew Davies, Combinable Crops; Richard Williams, Poultry; Haydn Evans, Organics; Elwyn Evans, Tenants; Peter Francis, LAS Legal Board.
NFU Cymru director John Mercer said: "I would like to congratulate John and Aled on their reappointments, along with those who have been appointed to positions on NFU Cymru's boards and working groups.
"There can be little doubt that this is a crucial time for our industry, but I feel that the officeholder team we now have in place is well equipped to tackle the challenges we face head-on and ensure a bright future for Welsh food and farming."
