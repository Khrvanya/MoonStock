NFUS presses politicians for solutions to biofuel suitabilityThe National Farmers' Union of Scotland (NFUS) is calling for politicians to provide solutions to issues related to the reliability of biofuel.
In a statement, the NFUS pointed out that fuel is a reserved issue in the UK, and the organisation was seeking support from both the UK and Scottish Governments to find solutions.
Back in December, the NFUS wrote to Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps MP to highlight the problem.
The NFUS said it welcomed the decision by fuel manufacturer Petroineos at the end of last year to reduce biofuel content as a short-term solution.

The NFUS is asking the Government for the following:

A fuel replacement scheme to enable farmers who have problematic fuel on-farm to receive a fuel uplift and refill of alternative fuel suitable for their needs;
A review of the specification and testing protocols to ensure fuel produced within the UK is fit for purpose and reliable;
Further research into the behaviour of recycled oil and animal fats within diesel, and to assess if specific fats should be excluded from diesel.


Back in December, NFUS representatives attended a meeting with industry experts in December to discuss the specifications, standards and testing protocol of fuel.
"Fuel problems remain a top priority for our members and time and resources continue to be dedicated towards finding practical solutions and apply lessons from this event to ensure fuel issues such as this cannot impact agriculture again," said Zoe Meldrum, NFUS policy advisor.
"Members' evidence has been fundamental in understanding the problem, and more than 400 contacted NFUS in November and December, and we thank them for the invaluable information," Meldrum added.
Farmers who've experienced issues with biofuel are encouraged to take a NFU survey, which can be found here.
