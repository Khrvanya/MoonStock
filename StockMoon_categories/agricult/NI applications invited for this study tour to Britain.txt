NI applications invited for this study tour to BritainNorthern Ireland dairy farmers have the chance to see for themselves how two large Yorkshire enterprises manage their staffing and stock.
According to the last official figures, the average Northern Ireland dairy herd comprises 94 cows - one cow bigger than the UK average and exactly twice as high as the EU's 47-strong average herd size.
The region's growing herds have resulted in a range of new challenges for farmers with managing staff often proving as challenging as managing cows.
The tour, run by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA), will include visits to two large scale dairy farms in Yorkshire - A. & E. Banks and Son and Metcalfe Farms.
Both businesses milk over 650 cows selling more than 11,000L/cow/year.
Each business employs large numbers of staff, many of whom are part-time and have little previous farming experience. Both have very detailed protocols for each activity on the farm.
The trip will look at how the farms achieve key performance targets and at the protocols which have been developed to help achieve these.
This study tour is part of the Farm Innovation Visits Scheme which is being delivered by DAERA's College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise (CAFRE).
