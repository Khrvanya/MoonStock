NSA and British Wool launch campaign to fight back against anti-meat slursBig players in the British sheep industry are going to war against anti-farming campaigners, hoping to 'set the record straight' with a series of meetings designed to arm farmers against vegan and environmentalist propaganda.
The meetings, which will be run by the National Sheep Association (NSA) and British Wool will explore facts and statistics about the UK sheep industry, demonstrating the sector's role as part of the solution - rather than the cause - to climate change. The meetings will also take on other hot topics - such as sheep welfare and red meat consumption.
The meetings, titled 'Setting the sheep farming record straight', will be open to all sheep farmers.
Travelling the length and breadth of the country, events will take place in each of NSA's UK regions.
NSA chief executive Phil Stocker said: "Most involved with sheep farming recognise the criticisms recently thrown our way are completely unfounded. However, having the factual arguments to lead debates to defend our industry is a key part of the sector joining together to evidence this.
"The NSA believes that the UK public deserves to know the truth about the high standards of our farming and the positive impact UK agriculture has on the environment.
Too often in recent months, our story has been hidden behind damaging, inaccurate research based on worldwide intensive farming systems, so attendance at a meeting such as these that we are proud to present this autumn and winter could be vitally important as we aim to spread this message.
"I am very much looking forward to being a part of these meetings and would encourage all sheep farmers and the wider livestock industry to join us.."

British Wool producer marketing manager Gareth Jones added: "British Wool is looking forward to joining NSA for these important meetings and is looking forward to reminding attendees of the high standards of welfare followed by UK sheep shearers.
"We are also keen to share information on the environmental benefits of wool, an incredibly key message in today's climate."
A full list of meetings with dates and locations can be found on the NSA website. All meetings are free to attend and open to all involved in the sheep sector, whether an NSA member or not.
