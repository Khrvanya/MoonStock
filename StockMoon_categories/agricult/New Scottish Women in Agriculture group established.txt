New Scottish Women in Agriculture group establishedFollowing on from the recent publication of the Scottish Government's Women in Agriculture Task Force report, the industry group Women in Agriculture Scotland (WiAS) has been formalised.
The task force, which is co-chaired by Sutherland farmer Joyce Campbell and Scotland's Cabinet Secretary for Rural Economy, Fergus Ewing MSP, issued its final report in November 2019.
Joyce Campbell said: "I welcome the formalisation of this group and I urge everybody within Scottish agriculture to recognise that by supporting women to realise their full potential, we will create a fairer and more successful industry."
WiAS
WiAS was formed five years ago and aims to support, inspire and develop women in Scottish agriculture to achieve their aspirations and create a more progressive, successful and inclusive industry.
