New TAMS energy grants worth ˆ10 million announcedA series of new grants available for Irish farms under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) on-farm investment scheme has been announced by Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine Michael Creed.
The new measure will make EUR10 million worth of grants available for energy efficiencies and renewable energy technologies, following a comprehensive review of the TAMS scheme designed to increase its focus on sustainability.
Speaking today (Friday, March 15), Minister Creed said:
A comprehensive review of the investment items available under TAMS has been carried out by my department.
"The review factored in the latest available technologies to further drive energy efficiency at farm level and reduce electricity use on farms.
"This is part of the wider drive to position Irish agriculture as a global leader in sustainability and these investments will further enhance those credentials".
The new grants will be available for farmers from the next tranche of TAMS opening April 5 next.
Eligible investments include:

Solar PV Installation on Farms - to extend current availability under the scheme to all sectors. Grant aid in this initial pilot phase of up to EUR9,300 or up to 60% of the overall cost will be available to fund a 6kWp solar system;
LED Lighting - all lighting funded under the scheme will be required to be LED lighting. LED Lighting uses a fraction of the electricity consumed by conventional lighting. The current specifications for TAMS II include lighting in all new farm structures. In future, only LED lighting only will now be grant aided.The new measure will make EUR10 million worth of grants available for energy efficiencies and renewable energy technologies, following a comprehensive review of the TAMS scheme designed to increase its focus on sustainability.
