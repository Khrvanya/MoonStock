His experience has earned him the respect and trust of the whole industry, making him the ideal leader for a programme which will set new standards for collaboration between Government and producers.
He's been part of the Livestock Information programme from the early days, and I'm confident in his ability to lead the company to success as it moves into delivery, taking the programme from the drawing board and into the real world."

Through John's leadership, the programme will continue to pioneer a new and closer way of working between government and industry that will cement the UK's reputation for producing high quality, sustainable and trusted products.
John Cross added: "Livestock Information is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to transform the way traceability is managed in the livestock industry.
"The massive strides this programme has made since its inception will soon start to produce real-world results which will positively impact producers at all levels.
"As a farmer myself, I know what the sectors need world-class traceability to deliver, and as someone who's supported the programme for many years, I can see the way we can make those changes come about in a user-friendly way. I'm thrilled to take up this opportunity on behalf of the farming industry as a whole".
