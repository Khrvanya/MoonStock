New grain marketing forum planned for Cereals 2020Cereals Event has introduced a new feature for 2020 focusing on grain marketing.
The Grain Exchange will cover every element of grain markets, from innovative crops and new market opportunities, to budgeting and risk management.
Event director Alli McEntyre said: "The Grain Exchange is an incredibly useful new element and we are really looking forward to the seminars we have lined up.
They will provide growers with all the grain market information they need to drive profitability and stability in the years ahead.
Running across both days of the event, the seminar programme will feature a number of industry experts, including Amy Reynolds from the International Grains Council.
"The UK is now a market of its own, so price relationships are going to be important," she said.
"There is every possibility that its output could be impacted by this season's plantings - certainly for wheat, which could be a relatively small crop - meaning imports will likely be higher. So watching global markets is certainly something for UK farmers to do.
"The information and knowledge available in the Grain Exchange will be useful to any farmer and could help them implement vital changes to their businesses for the future."

Now Brexit is a reality, trade patterns will probably change markedly, particularly given the likely impact on the livestock sector and therefore feed consumption, explained McEntyre.
"So getting an overview of how grain markets are going to work will be incredibly useful for growers."
A risk management strategy is essential for UK agri-businesses, especially as they begin to expand into global markets, added Martin Boshell, senior business development manager at Cambridge FX, which is sponsoring the risk management session.
"A pro-active approach with the right counter-party can protect profit margins and give the flexibility that a modern business needs," he said.
Other sessions will include 'Beyond the farmgate - meet the end-users', and 'Innovative crops and how to market them'.
Visitors can also pit themselves against the market in an interactive game which puts their skills as a trader to the test.
There is also an opportunity to get involved before the event by entering a competition to predict the price of wheat on the day. There will be a prize for the closest entries, making for both a fun and informative day out, said McEntyre.
The Cereals Event will be held on June 10-11, 2020, at Chrishall Grange, Duxford, Cambridgeshire. For more information visit www.cerealsevent.co.uk.
