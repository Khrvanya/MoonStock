New name unveiled for one of the North’s largest rural land agenciesOne of the north's largest rural land and property agencies has announced it will change its name following its latest acquisition.
H&H Land and Property will become H&H Land & Estates, which incorporates three of the foremost rural land and property agencies in Cumbria - Michael CL Hodgson, H&H King and recently acquired Smeatons.
The new brand encompasses nine offices, 65 employees and dozens of services for property and landowners across the North of England and Scottish Borders.
The firm has steadily grown in recent years, and H&H Land & Estates now has departments covering agricultural services, development and planning, auctioneering, land, farms, rural and residential sales and lettings.
Managing director, Colin Tomlinson explained the decision to rebrand and the vision for the future: "After a consultation, we have chosen a name which embraces all areas of the businesses - H&H Land & Estates - to unify all areas under one brand with a strong identity.
Choosing to rebrand is never a decision made lightly but in doing so we are responding to the increasing complexity of the land and property sector, the changing face of land agency work, and the increasing diversity of customer requirements.
"In looking at our vision we are acknowledging our roots, the needs of clients, the changing marketplace and the demands of the industry.
