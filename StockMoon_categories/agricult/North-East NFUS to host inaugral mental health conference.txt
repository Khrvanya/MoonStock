Commenting on the first North East Mental Health Conference, regional chairman Davie Winton said: "Your health is your wealth and we are delighted to be hosting this conference which we hope many of our members will take the opportunity to participate in.
The huge stresses in our industry nowadays mean that we are all aware of someone somewhere who is suffering.
"This event will help us all better recognise the early symptoms of depression and show us how best to help support each other to get through the dark days. The quality of speakers is phenomenal, and this event should be a real cracker.
Liz Hancock, RGU vice-principal, added: "The university is working in close collaboration with NHS Grampian and the NFU on a piece of research to develop an intervention to enhance the mental wellbeing of the Scottish farming population.
"To date, a full systematic review of literature has been undertaken and members of the farming community have been interviewed to explore opinions on their mental health and wellbeing and what can be done to improve it.
"Work is in progress to codesign an intervention and we look forward to sharing our findings at the event."
