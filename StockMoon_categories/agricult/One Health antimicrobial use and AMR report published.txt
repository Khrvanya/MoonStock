One Health antimicrobial use and AMR report publishedThe Ireland - One Health Report on Antimicrobial Use and Antimicrobial Resistance was published by the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine earlier today (Thursday, January 31).
This report provides for the first time a snapshot of the antimicrobial use (AMU) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in both humans and food-producing animals in Ireland.
The World Health Organisation defines antimicrobial resistance as the resistance of a micro-organism to an antimicrobial drug that was originally effective for treatment of infections caused by it.
Antimicrobial resistance or AMR is a global threat and an urgent challenge, posing a significant risk to human health.
The Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have adopted the 'One Health' approach to AMR and to encourage multidisciplinary collaborative efforts across different sectors such as health, agriculture and the environment to achieve the best health outcomes for people and animals.
Today's report is part of Ireland's National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2017 - 2020, published in October 2017.
The new report shows that data in Ireland on AMU for humans and food-producing animals is improving all the time.
However, gaps remain in the information available, including:


                            // googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1511797470075-0'); });

Although data for approximately 90% of acute hospital and 95% of public-prescription antimicrobial use is available, there is no data for available for private-prescription antimicrobial use;
Surveillance of human AMR reflects invasive infections only - blood stream infections - in acute settings - and not on other infections, such as urinary tract infections and wound infections, outside of the acute setting;
Currently information from national surveillance of AMU does not include information on the appropriateness of the antimicrobials used in either sector;
There is no specific surveillance for AMR in imported food products;
There is also no systematic surveillance for AMR in the environment.This report provides for the first time a snapshot of the antimicrobial use (AMU) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in both humans and food-producing animals in Ireland.
