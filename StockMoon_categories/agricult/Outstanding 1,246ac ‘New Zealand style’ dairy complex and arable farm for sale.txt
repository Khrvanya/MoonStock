Outstanding 1,246ac ‘New Zealand style’ dairy complex and arable farm for saleGalbraith is launching to the open market an outstanding dairy and arable farm, extending to about 1,246.92ac (504.62ha) in total.
Ardgarth Farm and the lands at Balshando and Ledyatt are situated in a private position with a picturesque outlook over the surrounding countryside, just outside Lundie and 9 miles from Dundee, Angus.
Included in the sale is an excellent range of modern purpose-built dairy facilities, a completely renovated traditional four-bedroom farmhouse, a separate two-bedroom cottage, and a productive area of arable and pasture ground.
Lundie is situated just a quarter of a mile from the property, while Dundee is nine miles and Edinburgh is 60 miles.

New Zealand style dairy complex
The property was acquired by the current owners in 2014, with the principal aim to create a modern New Zealand style dairy complex. Milking at the brand-new Ardgarth site commenced in January 2015.
The current farming system is centred on 600 dairy cows which are milked on a 54-point Milflos (GEA) rotary parlour, which was installed as part of the new dairy complex.

It is complemented with cubicle housing and a bulk outdoor feed passage for 660 cows, modern calf and young stock sheds, a large slurry lagoon and three silage clamps.

Duncan Barrie, who is a partner with Galbraith, commented on the opportunity and scale of the property for sale:
"This is an exciting and rare opportunity to acquire a substantial dairy unit located in an accessible location on the Angus and Perthshire border.
"The farm is equipped with a first-class dairy complex and housing for up to 660 cows plus followers. It is rare to see a property with this level of infrastructure and an exceptional range of modern farm buildings come to the open market."
Significant investment
The dairy complex is surrounded by a productive block of farmland which is utilised on a grass-based paddock grazing system with a network of 5,000m of new internal tracks and cow steps which provide access to the majority of the fields from the collecting area at the dairy.
An excellent network of farm roads and cow walkways connect the dairy complex with the land. Each field in Lot 1 benefits from concrete water troughs which are connected to private or mains water supply.

The farmland has benefitted from a significant investment in the soil health via an ongoing programme of drainage and reseeding and regular applications of slurry generated from the dairy enterprise.

All of the arable and pasture land has been soil tested and has gone through a programme of lime and nutrient applications since 2014 to maximise the fertility of the holding.
"In addition there is a sizable area of arable land and excellent grazing ground, with the former having been cropped historically for cereals and other winter harvested vegetables, presenting a well-balanced mixed-farming unit," commented Duncan.
The land is relatively free draining in nature allowing for silage and grazing to be taken late into the year.
A continuous programme of fencing, drainage and reseeding works has been undertaken to provide premium quality forage and grazing, and the majority of the fields have been cropped for cereals and potatoes in the past.
The majority of the arable land has been classified as Grade 3.2 and Grade 4.1 by The James Hutton Institute.
The remainder of the pasture and hill grazing has been classified as Grade 4 and Grade 5 and there are two areas at Balshando Loch and at Ardgarth Hill which have been designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).

There are areas of woodland situated throughout the holding, providing shelter for cattle, some rough grazing and two lochs (Lundie Loch and Balshando Loch), adding to the amenity of the holding.

"The investments made by the current owners have ensured that all of the land is farmed to its maximum potential, complemented by a well laid out infrastructure and attractive and refurbished residential accommodation," said Duncan.
"I expect significant interest in this property from a range of potential buyers."
The farm is for sale as a whole for offers over PS5 million.

Alternatively, the property is also for sale in two lots as follows:

Lot 1: Offers over PS3,825,000; or
Lot 2: Offers over PS1,175,000.

It is complemented with cubicle housing and a bulk outdoor feed passage for 660 cows, modern calf and young stock sheds, a large slurry lagoon and three silage clamps.

Duncan Barrie, who is a partner with Galbraith, commented on the opportunity and scale of the property for sale:
"This is an exciting and rare opportunity to acquire a substantial dairy unit located in an accessible location on the Angus and Perthshire border.
"The farm is equipped with a first-class dairy complex and housing for up to 660 cows plus followers. It is rare to see a property with this level of infrastructure and an exceptional range of modern farm buildings come to the open market."
Significant investment
The dairy complex is surrounded by a productive block of farmland which is utilised on a grass-based paddock grazing system with a network of 5,000m of new internal tracks and cow steps which provide access to the majority of the fields from the collecting area at the dairy.
An excellent network of farm roads and cow walkways connect the dairy complex with the land. Each field in Lot 1 benefits from concrete water troughs which are connected to private or mains water supply.

The farmland has benefitted from a significant investment in the soil health via an ongoing programme of drainage and reseeding and regular applications of slurry generated from the dairy enterprise.

All of the arable and pasture land has been soil tested and has gone through a programme of lime and nutrient applications since 2014 to maximise the fertility of the holding.
"In addition there is a sizable area of arable land and excellent grazing ground, with the former having been cropped historically for cereals and other winter harvested vegetables, presenting a well-balanced mixed-farming unit," commented Duncan.
The land is relatively free draining in nature allowing for silage and grazing to be taken late into the year.
A continuous programme of fencing, drainage and reseeding works has been undertaken to provide premium quality forage and grazing, and the majority of the fields have been cropped for cereals and potatoes in the past.
The majority of the arable land has been classified as Grade 3.2 and Grade 4.1 by The James Hutton Institute.
The remainder of the pasture and hill grazing has been classified as Grade 4 and Grade 5 and there are two areas at Balshando Loch and at Ardgarth Hill which have been designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).

There are areas of woodland situated throughout the holding, providing shelter for cattle, some rough grazing and two lochs (Lundie Loch and Balshando Loch), adding to the amenity of the holding.

The land is relatively free draining in nature allowing for silage and grazing to be taken late into the year.
A continuous programme of fencing, drainage and reseeding works has been undertaken to provide premium quality forage and grazing, and the majority of the fields have been cropped for cereals and potatoes in the past.
The majority of the arable land has been classified as Grade 3.2 and Grade 4.1 by The James Hutton Institute.
The remainder of the pasture and hill grazing has been classified as Grade 4 and Grade 5 and there are two areas at Balshando Loch and at Ardgarth Hill which have been designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).

There are areas of woodland situated throughout the holding, providing shelter for cattle, some rough grazing and two lochs (Lundie Loch and Balshando Loch), adding to the amenity of the holding.
