  Pee for plantsOn the outskirts of  Kathmandu, Siddhipur village has rediscovered the value of urine. More  than 100 toilets in the village divert urine to farms, where it is used  as fertilizer. It is not a new practice, though. The village was  recycling urine before modern fertilizers were introduced. "In the past,  people would urinate in a pit of ash and rice husk under their  staircase. They would then use the composted material as fertilizer,"  said Jiban Maharjan of Siddhipur.

An enterprising farmer, Maharjan is among the first few in the village  who started using urine six years ago. That was the time when Kathmandu   ngo  Environment and Public Health  Organization that promotes ecological sanitation--ecosan in short--had  introduced toilets segregating urine and faeces in the village. Maharjan  asked the  ngo  to instal an ecosan toilet  in his house. He said the potato yield of his plot is equal to what his  neighbour gets from six times as much land. In his experience urine also  makes vegetables larger and more resistant to pests.

By improving yield and reducing use of synthetic fertilizers, urine can  bring additional profits to the farmer. An experiment at an Indian  village showed how. Farmers at Musiri in Tiruchirappalli district of  Tamil Nadu collect urine from a community ecosan toilet and use it as  fertilizer for 750 banana plants. The experiment started by the National  Research Centre for Banana (nrcb), in  collaboration with  scope, a non-profit in  the region, has generated data over five years that shows one can make  an additional profit of Rs 45,175 per hectare by using urine. Of this,  Rs 36,250 is due to increased bunch weight and Rs 8,925 saved on  synthetic fertilizers, said M M Mustafa, director of  nrcb.

Using urine as fertilizer, though, has its limitations. "It is  misleading to say it is a complete solution," said Madhab Nayak,  president of the Fountain of Development Research and Action, a  Delhi-based  ngo  that has tried promoting  use of urine in farms in a Ghaziabad village (see 'Collector's item',  Down  To Earth, November 16-30, 2008). 


Sufficient nutrients?

Nayak  has compared crops' nutritional requirements with urine's nutrient  content. According to the  Handbook of Agriculture, the most  authoritative publication on Indian agriculture by the Indian Council  for Agricultural Research, a one-hectare plot requires 80-120 kg of  nitrogen, 60 kg of phosphorous and 40 kg of potassium for growing wheat.  Nayak explained that urine, though rich in nitrogen, fails to meet the  demands for the other two macronutrients during the first application.  But in the second and third application neither phosphorous nor  potassium is needed. Using urine for the second and third time amounts  to excess fertilizing, he warned.

M Subburaman, director of  scope,  experimenting with urine     fertilization in Tiruchirappalli, said the  trick lies in getting the nutrient combinations right. This was possible  since his team tested the nutrient content of the urine supplied along  with the nutrient requirement of a banana plant per season (see table).  "We found that while urine was meeting the nitrogen and phosphorous  demands, lack of potassium was affecting the plant height and pseudostem  girth," Subburaman said. His team supplemented urine with 75 per cent  of the recommended dose for potassium. "We recorded the highest bunch  weight with this combination," he added.
 
 
 
 
The  right practice 

How one applies urine is also crucial. To  avoid the risk of microbial infection one must take care that urine is  not mixed with faeces and is applied 10-20 cm from the plant, said Helvi  Heinonen-Tanski, professor at the department of environmental science,  University of Eastern Finland. There could be some risk if the urine  contains antibiotics-- soil bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics  and pass on the resistance to bacteria infecting people--but this is  hardly the case, said Tanski, who has written academic papers on the use  of urine as fertilizer.

To make sure it is free of microbes, urine collected at the community  toilet in Musiri is made to pass through sand and charcoal filters and  stored in a tank for a week.  who  guidelines  say no storage is needed when urine is collected from household ecosan  toilets that segregate faeces and urine, as in the case of Maharjan, or  when the user ensures the urine is not contaminated by faeces and by  others' urine. Urine originating from ecosan community toilets should be  stored for at least a month before use.

Urine can be applied diluted or undiluted, depending on the soil and  crop. Mixing urine with water reduces the risk of wilting and excess  fertilization, while crops get irrigated at the same time. "For each  banana plant we found that applying 10 litres of urine mixed with 100  litres of water five times a year gave the best results," said Mustafa.

Maharjan devised his method of applying urine through trial and error.  Inspired by a workshop on urine use organized by the Kathmandu  ngo, he began his own experiments on vegetables,  fruits and flowers. Over six years he found applying urine two to three  weeks before sowing is best. He would furrow a line at the site where  the seed is to be placed, apply undiluted urine and cover with dung  mixed with soil. Two litres for a length of six feet is sufficient for  potato, he said. Once the saplings appear he applies urine (diluted to a  ratio of 1:3) three more times.  

Best for densely populated areas 
If  Maharjan can benefit from urine why not all farmers? What holds back the  use of urine on a wide scale is the logistics of collection and  transportation. "For instance, growing rice on a hectare needs 10,000  litres of urine for the first application. This means connecting toilets  of over 100 families to a plot of this size," Nayak said. So high  density of population is essential. Nayak says urine fertilization  schemes must target peri-urban areas within two km of the point of use.

In Musiri village, the banana plantations are two km from the community  toilet. Each week 250 litres are transported to the field. Since April  bullock carts have replaced cycles for transportation. It could be  easier still. One way to escape lugging urine is to convert it into  struvite, white and odourless powder formed when magnesium is added to  urine. Struvite takes up less volume and is lighter than urine. It is  easy to store and handle. Eawag, the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic  Science and Technology, in collaboration with  un  - habitat  Nepal, chose Siddhipur to assess  the feasibility of converting urine into struvite. The project--Struvite  for Urine in Nepal (stun)--is the first  example of in situ production of struvite in a developing country. 

A  stun  report says struvite, or magnesium  ammonium phosphate, contains 6 per cent nitrogen and 29 per cent  phosphate. The most efficient source of magnesium is bittern, the waste  product of salt making available for free in India. Subburaman plans to  use struvite and discard bullock carts in the long run.     Making  struvite in Nepal costs more because bittern has to be imported. Another   source of magnesium in Nepal is magnesite from mines in Dolakha.  

stun's calculation shows struvite  can  generate in Siddhipur will be much less than than the village's demand.

Can urine go commercial?
"We could do  so much more, if only we had more urine," Maharjan said. He is lucky  his neighbours, who have urine-diverting toilets but no farms, are  providing him their urine.  stun  research  coordinator Bastian Etter is clear where to focus. "Where we see the  potential for struvite is in the city," he said. 

There are some who do not agree. "For experimental and academic exercise  it is fine, but there is little scope for commercial use," said U S  Awasthi, managing director of the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative  Ltd.

Synthetic fertilizers are subsidized by the government--for 2010-11 it is  projected to be Rs 50,000 crore. But urine use is not recognized by the  Fertilizer Control Order issued by the Indian agriculture ministry to  provide for price, quality and quantity control.

In Nepal,  stun  is not ready to give up. It  is launching two projects within a month to promote sustainable use of  urine. In Siddhipur a urine bank is under construction. The second plan  is to make struvite on a larger scale. On the outskirts of  Kathmandu, Siddhipur village has rediscovered the value of urine.
