Police issue warning after Weymouth veterinary burglariesPolice are appealing for help after medicines for animal use were stolen from a veterinary practice in Weymouth - nearly three weeks after an almost identical break-in.
Dorset Police received a report of a "suspicious man" in the garden of an address in Dorchester Road at 2:24am on Thursday (August 8).
Officers attended and discovered that access had been gained to Moorcroft Veterinary Practice.
A cabinet that securely housed the practice's dangerous drugs was forced open and a quantity of ketamine was stolen. Cash was also taken from the till.
It comes almost three weeks after an almost identical offence took at the practice on the morning of Friday, July 19.
On that occasion, the entire contents of the dangerous drugs cabinet were stolen, including ketamine and euthanasia drugs.
Police Constable Tom Arnold, of Weymouth police, said: "A full investigation is underway to establish who is responsible for both this latest break-in and the previous offence.
"I would urge anyone who was in the Dorchester Road area at the time and witnessed anything suspicious to please contact Dorset Police.
The drugs stolen are only normally administered under clinical supervision and as stated following the previous burglary we are sending out an urgent warning to the public about these drugs now being in public circulation.
"Anyone taking them is putting their health at serious at risk. Taken in excess these drugs could lead to serious injury or death. It is therefore imperative that we locate these drugs to ensure no one comes to harm.

"Anyone who thinks they've taken any of these drugs should go straight to A&E and take the packaging with them. You don't know how you will react to a particular drug or medicine. Everyone is different and drugs can affect people in different ways.
"I would like to get a message out to anyone involved in the misuse of drugs in the Dorset area to be aware that the use of such substances can prove fatal to the user."
