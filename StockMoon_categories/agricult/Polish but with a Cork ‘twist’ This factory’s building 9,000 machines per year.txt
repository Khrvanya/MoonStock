Polish but with a Cork ‘twist’ This factory’s building 9,000 machines per yearSaMASZ - a Polish manufacturer that is gaining ground here in Ireland - brought a delegation of Irish dealers and customers to Bialystok (Poland) to get a look inside its new factory.
The company - via distributor Timmy O'Brien (based close to Mallow, Co. Cork) - is keen to build awareness of its brand-name and its products.

Readers might already be familiar with these machines; some have been in this country for several years.

In any case, Timmy is encouraged by the new factory; it's part of an overall investment stretching to over 90 million Polish Zloty (over EUR20 million).

At present, up to 750 people work there (at peak times); there is scope for that to increase significantly in future.

SaMASZ is probably best known for its mowers - both disc and drum-type machines. But it also builds a growing range of tedders, rakes, hedge-cutters and even snow ploughs.

In the vast dispatch yard behind the factory, we spotted a diet (tub) feeder (pictured below). It's actually the result of a collaboration with a local manufacturer (and, unlike the other machines, is built off-site).

The company also has an agreement in place with Maschio Gaspardo, whereby SaMASZ supplies machines to be sold under Maschio Gaspardo's brand-name (and in its colour scheme) in some markets.
All told, SaMASZ lays claim to being a significant player in the agricultural machinery manufacturing sector in Poland.

It, for example, says that it is among the top five in the country - in terms of output. Other key Polish players include the likes of Unia, Pronar, Metal-Fach and Ursus.

Production is now reportedly up to 9,000 machines per year, encompassing anything from basic two-drum mowers right up to contractor-spec 'butterfly' machines.

Here in Ireland, Timmy now has six dealers on board - dotted about the country.
These are:

Agrimann Ltd (Carnaross, Kells, Co. Meath);
Kieran McAteer (Banbridge, Co. Down);
McGrath Agri Contractors (Kiltown, Co. Kilkenny);
Tobin & Cantwell Ltd (Coalbrook, Thurles, Co. Tipperary);
West Waterford Agri (Ballymote, Tallow, Co. Waterford);
WW Doherty Ltd (Adare, Co. Limerick).The company - via distributor Timmy O'Brien (based close to Mallow, Co. Cork) - is keen to build awareness of its brand-name and its products.
