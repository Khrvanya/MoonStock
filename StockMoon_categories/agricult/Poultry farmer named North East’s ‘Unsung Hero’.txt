Making the presentation of an Angela Davidson limited edition print of hens called 'Battery Pac', McCornick praised Hay for the "astute, intelligent and modest way" in which he represented poultry producers across the country.
In particular, he highlighted the "sterling work" carried out several years ago in the face of damaging plant closures and the impact that had on Scottish chicken production.
