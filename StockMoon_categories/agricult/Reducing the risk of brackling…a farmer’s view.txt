Reducing the risk of brackling…a farmer’s viewAs spring barley varieties increase in yield other factors can become problematic. Brackling is one such problem and can cause serious losses at harvest.
David Kehoe - a cereal farmer and contractor - from Co. Wexford spoke at the BASF Technical Conference this week in Co. Kilkenny on strategies that he uses to reduce the risk of brackling in his crops.
David supplies straw to the horse market and as a result needs a high-quality product.
Brackling can affect straw quality, as well as resulting in a reduction in grain yield. The problem can also result in less efficient harvesting of the crop, as cutting can be slower.
David explained six of the most important management practices affecting brackling:

Variety resistance;
Soil and applied potassium (K);
Soil and applied manganese;
Nitrogen rate;
Fungicide choice;
