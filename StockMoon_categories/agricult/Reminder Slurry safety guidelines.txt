Reminder Slurry safety guidelinesYesterday signaled an end to the closed period for spreading fertiliser in Zone A. Last week, AgriLand spoke with Pat Griffin of the Health and Safety Authority.
He explained the HSA's definitive list of safe agitation guidelines and stated: "If people follow [the list] they have a huge chance of not being affected."
He urged people to read the list and plan ahead before spreading slurry.
Safe agitation guidelines from the HSA:

Agitate on windy days;
Remove all livestock and control pets;
Open all doors and control access;
Agitate/ventilate and stay away for 30 minutes;
Work upwind at all times;
Do not enter tanks - even when empty;
Keep tank openings secure at all times;
If possible, avoid agitating alone.He explained the HSA's definitive list of safe agitation guidelines and stated: "If people follow [the list] they have a huge chance of not being affected."
