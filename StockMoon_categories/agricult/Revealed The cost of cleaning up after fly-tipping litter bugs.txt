Revealed The cost of cleaning up after fly-tipping litter bugs2018 might yet be one of the worst years on record for fly-tipping and illegal dumping on land, on streets in towns and in villages across the country.
Information obtained by AgriLand indicates that hundreds of thousands of euro was spent by local authorities cleaning up after litter bugs last year and that a significant number of on-the-spot fines were issued to guilty parties.
The clean-up process has been a very costly exercise for some local authorities.
AgriLand can reveal that Kilkenny County Council, for example, forked out a massive EUR1.3 million last year just to tidy up after fly-tippers and to maintain its street cleaning and bin servicing.
In a statement, the local authority said it received a total of 1,219 complaints in relation to littering and illegal dumping in 2018 - a total of 95 fines were subsequently issued under the Litter Pollution Act 1997.
"A total of 10 cases proceeded to court in 2018 and were successfully prosecuted. Six of the cases related to offences in 2017 and four related to 2018 offences.
"A total of EUR6,515 was collected in litter fines and EUR2,599 collected under court awarded costs," a spokesperson added.
Meanwhile, Cavan County Council said it received 612 complaints in relation to "litter and waste" in 2018 and spent close to EUR1 million (EUR929,819) cleaning up in the aftermath.
The local authority issued 150 fines in respect of the matter and collected EUR10,694 as a result. One case made it to the district court and EUR150 was collected following conviction.
Monaghan
Further north in Co. Monaghan, the local authority there received 324 litter related complaints and issued 80 on-the-spot fines.
Monaghan County Council spent EUR30,000 on a litter awareness programme last year and EUR644,000 was spent on "scavenging activities" in 2017.  A spokesperson also pointed to the fact that 2018 figures have yet to be confirmed.
Meanwhile, AgriLand can also reveal that Monaghan County Council spent EUR1.4 million on clean-up costs last year. This figure was broken down into payment for removal of rubbish; fleet / plant materials; and waste disposal costs.
Dublin
In the capital, South Dublin County Council told AgriLand that it received 3,698 complaints regarding illegal dumping, fly-tipping and littering in 2018.
All such cases are investigated by our Litter Warden Service to establish if there was any identifying evidence and as a result 598 fines were issued.
The spokesperson continued: "A total of EUR46,067 was received in payment against these fines; some of this figure relates to fines issued in late 2017.

15 litter bugs were convicted in the local district court and the county council collected a total of EUR5,685 in penalties. The litter management costs for Kerry County Council for 2017 amounted to EUR602,148.
Limerick
Meanwhile, in Co. Limerick the local authority received 1,876 complaints in relation to littering and illegal dumping.
59 cases proceeded to the district court where 24 convictions ensued and EUR800 was collected in fines.

Louth
In the north east, Louth County Council had 19 prosecutions in 2018 under the litter Pollution Act and collected a total of EUR21,949.20 in fines.
