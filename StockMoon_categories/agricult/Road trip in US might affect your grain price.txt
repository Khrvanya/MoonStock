Road trip in US might affect your grain priceReports over the past number of weeks on plantings and crop condition from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) have baffled farmers and changed the course of grain markets.
This week, live and up-to-date data from the ProFarmer Midwest Crop Tour will be watched with interest.
AgriLand has been following the tour on Twitter, as it provides the most up-to-date information available on the US corn crop.
Over 100 scouts are currently travelling in the midwest region of the US. Along the route they stop every 15 to 20 miles and sample corn fields; the routes are pre-determined. On the first day scouts sampled in Ohio and South Dakota, while also taking in some of Indiana and Nebraska.
Scouts will only be taking samples from planted acres and have been instructed to pass by 'prevent plant' acres.
However, if for example a scout stops in a soybean field and the pods have not yet emerged then that field will receive a zero in that count.

Reports so far - South Dakota
Betsy Jibben (US Farm Report) reported from South Dakota yesterday, August 19, and stated that some scouts were commenting that corn crops were behind in maturity and looked like July corn crops.
