SIMA 2019 Wraps come off new 190220hp MFMassey Ferguson is showcasing its new 7719 S tractor (pictured) at this week's SIMA show in Paris, France.
AgriLand's own Breifne O'Brien is at the event today (Monday, February 25). He took these photographs.
The 7719 S is home to a six-cylinder (6.6L) AGCO Power (Stage V compliant) engine. Rated power output is 190hp; maximum output is 220hp.

The tractor is also fitted with MF's Dyna-VT stepless transmission (which, underneath the skin, is essentially a Fendt/AGCO Vario unit). Maximum travel speed is 40kph; a 50kph top whack is optional.

The standard hydraulic system can churn through 110L/min. This can be optionally upped to 190L/min.
The tractor is available in either 'Efficient' or 'Exclusive' specification - phrases that are already known to MF's dealers and end-users.

It's worth noting that we (AgriLand) first saw Massey Ferguson's 'S' Series tractors early last year.
At that time, the latest incarnations of its high-specification tractor models built in Beauvais (France) boasted new styling, the option of the new Fieldstar 5 touch-screen terminal and a host of new standard features.
To signal these updates, all new, high-spec Beauvais-built tractor ranges would ultimately carry the suffix 'S' in the model number.

"We have already seen that Whelans has formed solid relations with customers over the years. This continues to be a major focus for all of us."
