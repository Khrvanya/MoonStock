SRUC and ADAS to join forces in new partnershipScotland's Rural College (SRUC) and ADAS, the UK's largest independent agricultural and environmental consultancy have joined forces in a new partnership.
The partnership will allow the organisations to pull their research expertise and offer agri-businesses greater access to the latest independent advice and world-leading innovation.
Through the joint venture, new and existing partners will be able to tap into the experts at ADAS and SRUC - which includes SAC Consulting, their specialist consultancy and diagnostic services, as well as education and training courses. The partnership will also be the vehicle for more collaborative research.
The joint venture will operate in fields such as agriculture and climate change; soil health, synthesis of evidence to support policy development; data, ecological modelling and genomics; sustainable diets and food production systems; animal welfare; and sustainable food supply.
Among the new partnership's priorities will be to launch a new digital platform that will provide a shop window to an independent source of knowledge, expertise, tools and services for the rural and food sectors. This new project will be announced in the springtime of 2020.
ADAS has 400 staff delivering in 60 specialist subjects across England and Wales. SRUC, through SAC Consulting, have 24 offices across Scotland and Northern England and offer a range of specialisms in soil nutrition, livestock and agronomy, branding and marketing of food products, and analytical testing.
Colin MacEwan, director of commercialisation and innovation, said: "The combined expertise of both ADAS and SRUC creates an extraordinary wealth of knowledge that will be of vital importance to the future of our food and farming industry.
