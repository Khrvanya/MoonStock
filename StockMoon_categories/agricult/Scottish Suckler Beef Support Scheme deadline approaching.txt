Scottish Suckler Beef Support Scheme deadline approachingEligible farmers and crofters are reminded to apply to the Scottish Suckler Beef Support Scheme (SSBSS) before the deadline of December 31, 2019.
The scheme provides support to specialist beef producers and has an annual budget of EUR38 million for beef calves born on the Scottish mainland and EUR6.6 million for claims from the Scottish islands. 
SSBSS support is available for calves provided they are at least 75% beef bred, born on a Scottish holding and kept there for 30 days.
This means that animals born on or after December 2, 2019, will not be eligible until the next scheme year.
There is no limit to the number of claims eligible farmers and crofters can make by December 31. The scheme rate per animal will be determined by the total number of eligible animals claimed.

'Every penny will be needed'
NFU Scotland's Livestock Committee chairman Jimmy Ireland, who farms at Darvel in Ayrshire, said: "Given what a difficult year it has been for Scotland's iconic beef sector, with finished prices tumbling by almost PS200/head, the beef calf scheme will be more important than ever to a beef farmer's bottom line. Every penny available under this scheme will be needed.
This coupled support payment is a vital element in maintaining our iconic beef sector, which produces sustainable and local beef based on Scotland's natural ability to grow grass.
"I would urge farmers and crofters to take advantage of this support."
