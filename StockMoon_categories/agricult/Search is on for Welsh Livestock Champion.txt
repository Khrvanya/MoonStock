Search is on for Welsh Livestock ChampionNFU Cymru and NFU Mutual are again looking to find the best livestock person working within the agricultural industry in Wales.
Now in its sixth year, the Welsh Livestock Champion of the Year Award seeks to champion dedicated, committed and enthusiastic stockmen and women from across Wales.
The award winner will receive a top prize of PS500 and a Welsh Royal Crystal Trophy.
Wyn Evans, chairman of NFU Cymru's Livestock Board, who will judge on behalf of NFU Cymru, said: "Here in Wales we have some of the best quality beef and sheep in the world, produced to the highest animal health and welfare standards. This award aims to celebrate excellence amongst Welsh livestock producers.
"We want to recognise the key role an exceptional livestock person can make to a livestock farm, and to the Welsh livestock industry as a whole.
Potential winners will be judged on their management of the flock/herd, their animal health planning, breeding programme, their stock handling skills, how they incorporate health and safety into their day-to-day activities on-farm and their vision for the future of the industry.
Mike Thomas, Builth Wells Group Secretary who will be judging the award on behalf of NFU Mutual, said: "The quality of the stockmanship is a major factor in determining the success of any livestock business.
