She worked as a journalist in the Longford Leader for 11 years from 2007 to 2018 covering numerous areas including farming, rural life, legal affairs, current affairs and politics. Aisling also worked as a journalist in the Longford News during 2006 and 2007.
Over the last 12 years, she has spoken about many of the issues that affect Co. Longford and the greater midlands region on national radio.
She also appeared on TV3's Midweek to discuss the court poor-box debacle, which originated at Longford District Court.
Aisling has also covered numerous general and local election counts. Together with her Longford Leader colleague she was one of the last two journalists still standing when the Longford/Westmeath general election count concluded after six days in 2016, in what became known as 'The Seige of Kenagh!'
Apart from her nose for all things news, Aisling has a keen interest in literature and the arts. She also loves to spend time with her six little nieces and nephews and flies the flag with gusto for the Mullinalaghta St. Columba's football team.
