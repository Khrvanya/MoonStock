Sheep conference The importance of good-quality silageOpening the Teagasc National Sheep Conference earlier this week, Prof. Gerry Boyle outlined that, while it is not possible to control what goes on outside the farm gate, every effort should be made to increase efficiencies on individual farms.
Speaking at the conference - which was held in the Tullamore Court Hotel, Teagasc's Tim Keady gave a detailed presentation on SheepNet and its objectives.
During his presentation, he touched on the importance of feeding top-quality silage; the majority of sheep that are housed between mid and late pregnancy in this country are offered grass silage.
He said: "Dry matter digestibility (DMD) is the most important factor that effects silage feed value. A series of studies undertaken at Athenry over the last 15 years can be summarised that, each 5% unit increase in silage digestibility increases ewe weight by 6.5kg and lamb birth weight by 0.25kg."
Grass silage feed value on concentrate requirements during late pregnancy:

DMD is the main factor affecting silage feed value;
Silage chop length affects silage intake by sheep;
Each 5% unit increase in silage digestibility increases ewe weight post lambing by 6.5kg and lamb birth weight by >=0.25kg;
Enables optimum use of concentrate supplementation, thus reducing costs;
Silage feed value must be determined (laboratory analysis) to develop a feed plan.Speaking at the conference - which was held in the Tullamore Court Hotel, Teagasc's Tim Keady gave a detailed presentation on SheepNet and its objectives.
