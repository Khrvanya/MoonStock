Sheep conference What are the causes of lamb mortality in the first week of lifeSpeaking at the Teagasc National Sheep Conference earlier tonight (Tuesday, January 29) in the Tullamore Court Hotel, Teagasc's Tim Keady gave a detailed presentation on SheepNet and its objectives.
SheepNet - a network involving the six main sheep-producing countries in Europe - aims to improve sheep productivity through the exchange of scientific, technical and practical knowledge between all levels of stakeholders in the sheep industry.
SheepNet has compiled many solutions to the needs/challenges to improving ewe productivity and tips and tricks to aid implementation.

During his presentation, he touched on the causes of lamb mortality in the first week of life - neonatal mortality.
Referring to research carried out in Athenry, he said: "52% of neonatal mortality occurs prior to or at birth. In other words, half of your lambs are dead by the time they hit the ground.
"Another 21% will die within 24 hours and 27% of neonatal mortality occurs between 24 hours and seven days-of-age," he added.
Causes:
