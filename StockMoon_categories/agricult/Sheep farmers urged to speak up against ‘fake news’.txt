Sheep farmers urged to speak up against ‘fake news’The National Sheep Association (NSA) is urging sheep farmers to call out so-called 'fake news' and to do their part in correcting the many misleading statements made about the industry.
The association's main concern is the popularity of alternative land management strategies and vegetarian foods as options in the mainstream media.
However, it argues that grass-based sheep production, as is common in the UK, is one of the most environmentally-friendly methods of food production and can instead be part of the global warming solution.
Despite such claims appearing increasingly across the UK, the NSA said that by eating sensible amounts of British lamb from extensive grass-based systems consumers can feel confident their food choice is helping to protect our future.
NSA chief executive Phil Stocker explained: "Contrary to mainstream media messages sheep, by their very existence, are excellent for the planet and are part of the circular recycling of natural elements.
Their reliance on fossil fuels is minimal compared to processed foods based on soya, almonds or palm oil - and we all know that Britain's grasslands are highly appreciated for their association with our native wildlife whether its birds, mammals or insects.
He explained that the confusion comes from journalists and those with a vegan agenda making assumptions based on global statistics to compare different food production systems rather than looking at the impact of British beef and sheep farms.
As a result, there has been a spate of headline-grabbing claims over the last few months such as: "The best thing we can do for the planet is to stop eating meat".

Stocker explained: "UK sheep farms have sheep spread across the countryside - often in areas that simply not suitable for other types of farming - and are used in other systems to help naturally rejuvenate the soil for arable crops.
"Sheep can be used in so many ways to benefit the environment and it's highly dangerous that naivety from mainstream media that risks increasing our environmental footprint."
Livestock is also widely criticised for its methane emissions; which NSA say is, again, misleading.
Stocker added: "Methane shouldn't be ignored; it is an emitted gas that has an impact on global warming. However, we now know that it doesn't behave in the same way as the other major warming gases and the calculations should take this into account.
Methane has a short, rotational life cycle that means, providing livestock numbers remain stable, methane levels won't build and build.
"We are also finding that Nitrous Oxide emissions from grassland are far lower than was previously assumed and it only needs a small application of common sense to conclude that the main problems are caused by fossil fuels - the lower the reliance on fossil fuels, the lower the impact on global warming.
"The focus on red meat is taking attention away from people changing their habits in other areas that could have a far greater beneficial impact on climate change".
