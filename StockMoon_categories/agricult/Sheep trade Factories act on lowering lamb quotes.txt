Sheep trade Factories act on lowering lamb quotesThe recent rise in lamb quotes has ceased with processors moving to take a hold of the market. However, farmers are encouraged to bargain hard when it comes to marketing their animals.
This week, many procurement managers are starting negotiations with farmers at 520c/kg (excluding quality assurance (QA) and producer group bonuses) for lambs.
When QA payments are factored in, this brings prices to 530-535c/kg, while factory agents are currently offering 260-270c/kg (excluding Quality Assurance Scheme bonus) for well-fleshed ewes.
