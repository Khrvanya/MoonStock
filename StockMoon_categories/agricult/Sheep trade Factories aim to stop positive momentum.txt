Sheep trade Factories aim to stop positive momentumWhile prices have been on the rise in recent weeks, factories are attempting to slow this positive momentum. No quotes were available for today, Tuesday. However, there are reports of up to EUR5.70/kg for large numbers.
However, there is a large variation in plants and farmers are encouraged to shop around when it comes to marketing their stock, with regular suppliers of lambs to market in the best position to secure the higher prices.
In the meantime, the IFA has reported prices from EUR5.50/kg up to as high as EUR5.70/kg. This is 20-25c/kg above the price at the same time last year.
Sean Dennehy - IFA sheep chairman - stated that moves by some plants to lower quotes and stall the strong rise in prices was meeting strong resistance from feeders.
Throughput significantly lower than 2018
35,414 head of sheep were slaughtered at Department of Agriculture approved slaughtering plants in the week ending February 3.
This is down by 7,607 head on the same week last year.
