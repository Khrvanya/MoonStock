Sheep trade ‘Factories anxious for lambs and struggling to secure numbers’Procurement managers are starting negotiations with sheep farmers at 500c/kg (excluding quality assurance (QA) and producer group bonuses) for hoggets.
When QA payments are factored in, this brings prices to 510-515c/kg, while factory agents are currently offering 260c/kg (excluding the Quality Assurance Scheme bonus) for well-fleshed ewes.
Kepak is quoting 500c/kg and 15c/kg QA, while both Irish Country Meats' plants are paying 500c/kg and 10c/kg QA. Kildare Chilling had no quote when contacted.
