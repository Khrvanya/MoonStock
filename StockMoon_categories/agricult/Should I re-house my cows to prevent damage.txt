Should I re-house my cows to prevent damageAll good things must come to an end. As the weather deteriorates, the contemplation begins on whether or not farmers should continue grazing or put the cows in until this spell of wet weather is over.
Before considering either option, some questions need to be answered.
How much damage is being done?
Many farmers are known to panic when they see grazing damage being done and immediately house animals. But, it is always important to think before you act.
Every farm is different; some farms are more prone to poaching damage than others. In wet weather conditions like this, a certain amount of poaching damage is inevitable; but, it is knowing when enough is enough that is important.
According to Teagasc, initial poaching damage - unless severe - has very minimal effects on subsequent grass production, as perennial-ryegrass swards are well adapted to coping with poaching damage.
However, it is repeat poaching damage in subsequent rounds which can lower future grass growth rates by up to 20%.
In addition, because the poaching is being done now in the first rotation, it has a greater length of time to recover before the second round.
Have you met your grazing targets to date?
Many farmers have struggled to reach their grazing targets to date; this is mainly due to the exceptional growth rates over the winter and spring.
If your first rotation grazing targets are not met and, you are behind on reaching 60% grazed by magic day, you should consider using some grazing techniques to continue getting grass into the cows' diet and increase the area grazed.
