Slurry spreading How much does it costAs slurry season approaches AgriLand has been pricing the cost of spreading in different parts of the country. There is a large variation in prices with equipment and location.
In this short article, we provide a quick glimpse of a selection of prices (charge-out rates) being touted (in advertisements) around the country. These figures are simply those that were observed at the time of writing.
Farmers who wish to spread with a trailing shoe will pay at the higher end of the spectrum. AgriLand spoke with a contractor in Co. Clare, spreading with a 2,000-gallon tanker and a tractor with a 40kph transmission. The cost is EUR55/hour (plus VAT), while agitation is a further EUR60/hour (plus VAT).
In Co. Meath, a 2,500-gallon tanker with a trailing shoe, behind a 40kph transmission, is costing EUR50/hour (plus VAT), while agitation is EUR60/hour (plus VAT).
In Co. Laois, EUR80/hour (plus VAT) was quoted for a 2,500-gallon tanker, while agitation was costing EUR55/hour (plus VAT).
Guide rates provided by the FCI (Association of Farm and Forestry Contractors in Ireland) recently suggested a charge-out rate of EUR80/hour (plus VAT) for a 2,500-gallon tanker with a trailing shoe.

Moving to splash-plates, in Co. Carlow, a smaller 1,600-gallon tanker behind a 50kph tractor is costing EUR35/hour (plus VAT), while agitation is set at EUR50/hour (plus VAT).
In Co. Laois, EUR40/hour (plus VAT) was quoted for a 2,500-gallon tanker, while agitation was EUR50/hour in the same set up.
A 2,250-gallon tanker in Co. Tipperary was costing EUR48/hour (including VAT).
The FCI's 'guide' rate for slurry spreading with a 1,500-gallon tanker is approximately EUR40/hour (plus VAT).
This would rise to EUR60/hour for a 2,500-gallon tanker; or EUR80/hour for a 3,000-gallon unit.
