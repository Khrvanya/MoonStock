Smoke signals point to ‘red’ for driver in DungannonA driver was "in the red" with members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) after being caught using red agricultural diesel in Co. Tyrone yesterday, Wednesday, November 6.
Stopped in Dungannon as a result of a significant amount of smoke billowing from the car's exhaust, police then discovered the vehicle to be "running on red", promptly seizing the car from the driver in question.
Taking to social media, members of the PSNI based in Tyrone said:
"If you're going to drive down the road with all this smoke belting out of your car, and people walking down the road having to breathe it in, then you'll be stopped.
If it's on red diesel, then it'll be seized.
Noting that the car was seized in Dungannon yesterday, the PSNI post added: "The driver can expect to pay a hefty fine."
