  South AsiaSalt-resistant  Paddy:  A new strain of paddy developed by the Bangladesh  Rice Research Institute  offers hope to coastal farmers who are  abandoning paddy farming due to soil salinity. The new salt-resistant  paddy--BRRI Dhan 47--can withstand 12-14 deci-siemens per metre (dS/m)  conductivity (higher electricity conductivity indicates higher salinity)  while they are tender and 6 dS/m conductivity in its lifespan of 155  days. The strain can be grown in shrimp enclosures also. More than one  million hectares in Bangladesh is affected by salinity.
