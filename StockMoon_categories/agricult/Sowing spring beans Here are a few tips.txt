Sowing spring beans Here are a few tipsTeagasc held a series of winter crop walks last week and gave some pointers to farmers planning on sowing beans this spring. Many have taken to the fields already, while more will venture in the coming days if weather allows.
Fertiliser
It is advised to apply fertiliser before planting. Phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) should be applied according to the soil sample results.
Sowing
Seeds should be drilled to a depth of 10cm (4in) into a fine seedbed. Teagasc advises a target of 36 seeds/m2, in order to establish 32 plants/m2.
Seed rate, as always, should be calculated using thousand grain weight (TGW).
