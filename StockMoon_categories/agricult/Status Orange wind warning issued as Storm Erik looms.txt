Storm Erik will see south-west to west winds reach mean speeds of 65 to 80kph with some severe or damaging gusts of 110 to 130kph.
The highest winds will be in exposed coastal areas, where these values may be exceeded at times. Very high seas are expected as well with some coastal flooding.
Meanwhile, an updated Status Yellow wind warning has been issued for the rest of the country.
The warning, updated at 11:00am today, will be valid from 5:00am tomorrow through to 6:00am on Saturday morning.
In these parts, Storm Erik will consist of south-west to west winds expected to reach mean speeds of 50 to 65kph with gusts of 80 to 110kph.
Again, these values may be exceeded for a while along exposed Atlantic coasts and, with very high seas, this will give the risk of coastal flooding.
