Telescopic handler sales are rising – FTMTAA remarkable level of new telehandler (telescopic handler) registrations have been seen so far in 2019. That's according to the Farm Tractor & Machinery Trade Association (FTMTA).
Gary Ryan, chief executive of the FTMTA, explained: "A total of 161 new telehandlers have been registered during the first two months of this year, which is an increase of 83% on the same time last year.
"The fact that 72 of these units were registered in Dublin and surrounding counties is undoubtedly an indication that many are destined for use in the resurgent construction sector in the greater Dublin area.

"Even so, many such machines were also registered in more rural areas. Indeed, these machines are an increasing feature of Irish agricultural mechanisation."
Interestingly, new telehandler registrations have generally been at "high levels" in recent years, with 374 units registered during the entirety of 2018.
