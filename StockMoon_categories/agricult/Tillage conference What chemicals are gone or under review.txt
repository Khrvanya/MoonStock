Tillage conference What chemicals are gone or under reviewThe chemical toolbox is shrinking and it was one of the topics discussed this morning (Wednesday, January 30) at the Teagasc National Tillage Conference .
While farmers are constantly trying to improve integrated pest management (IPM) strategies on farm, there is a reality that in order to meet high yield and in turn make a profit on tillage farms, a mixture of methods are needed to control weeds, plant diseases and pests.
Chemicals form a part of this IPM strategy. In recent years many chemicals have come under the hammer at EU level.
Steven Kildea - plant pathologist at Teagasc - outlined some of the chemicals that are no longer approved, are under review and could be reviewed in the next one to two years at the conference.
The chemicals he spoke about are listed and categorised below.
