Top Scottish butchery talent celebrated at National Training AwardsSix butchers from across Scotland have been recognised for their skills and progression in the Scottish Craft Butcher Training Awards.
The awards, which are sponsored by the Scotch Butchers Club run by Quality Meat Scotland (QMS) and the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), are in their fourth year.
They play a valuable role in recognising the efforts of young people to develop their butchery skills throughout their careers, as well as those who offer support along the way.
Scottish winners
Ian Hume, a butcher at David Bennett & Son in Dunblane, won 'Mentor of the Year' - an award for the individual who has encouraged a trainee in their development within their workplace.
Hugh Black & Sons, which operates 12 butcher shops across Scotland and is one of the biggest independent butchers in the country, took home 'Training Partner of the Year' - an award for the employer or business which has successfully engaged with Scottish Meat Training and the assessors, to maximize the potential of their trainees.
Sam Fachie from Aberdeen was named 'Level 3 Modern Apprentice of the Year' - an award for those excelling in their training.
Sam has seen the Modern Apprenticeship programme further his career, recently becoming the manager of Davidsons Specialist Butchers in Dobbies, Aberdeen, after reaching Level 3 of his Modern Apprenticeship.
