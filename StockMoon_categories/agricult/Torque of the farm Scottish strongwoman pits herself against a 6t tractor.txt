Torque of the farm Scottish strongwoman pits herself against a 6t tractorRecord-breaking Scottish strongwoman Kim Best has borrowed one of her employer's 6t tractors while training for her next event.
The 26-year-old, who works as a lab scientist for Scotland's Rural College at its Veterinary and Analytical Laboratory at Moredun's Pentlands Science Park in Midlothian, paid a visit to SRUC's nearby research farm to keep up her strength.
Kim, who is originally from Tain in the Highlands, recently broke the world record in the Yoke Walk, completing a 10m course with 350kg on her back in just 24.42 seconds.
She now has her sights set on Scotland's Strongest Woman 2020, which takes place in Motherwell on May 3.

Kim said: "Two weeks ago I got the amazing offer with my work to head up to one of the farms and have some pulling practice with one of our tractors.
This was so much fun to try - the traction of the tyres and the ground inside the shed made life a bit difficult to pull but once the tractor was rolling pulling felt awesome - [a] real power moment.
"I love having a job where what I do every day has a positive impact on the lives and welfare of animals, in addition to the amazing support from my team."
