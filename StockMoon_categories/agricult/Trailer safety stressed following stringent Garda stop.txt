"Fermoy Roads Policing stopped this vehicle early this morning. The driver used a makeshift breakaway cable made from electrical cable.
Where trailer brakes are fitted, they must be in working order - including a breakaway cable. If the trailer becomes detached, the cable will activate the trailer brakes and allow the vehicle and trailer to stop safely.
"The nylon rope used as a secondary coupling here would cancel out the cable," the Gardai said.
