Tullamore Show entrants to feature on last of 6-part seriesA six-part documentary series is being shown on TG4 titled 'Beidh Aonach Amarach'. The show follows competitors 'going for glory' at Ireland's country shows and fairs.
Last in this series is what TG4 claims is "the biggest one-day livestock show in Europe" - the Tullamore Show.
The camera will be following the secretary of Tullamore Show and the FBD National Livestock Show, Freda Kinnarney, and asking her about the planning and logistical operations involved in making sure the show goes smoothly.
Freda Kinnarney was born on the land which the show takes place and has spent a lifetime involved in every aspect of farming and agricultural life.
Freda married PJ Kinnarney in 1977. They have three children who all now work in different parts of the country while still keeping a strong connection to the land.
She has covered almost every role in the Tullamore Show over the past 25 years.
"It got to the stage that my work with the show was getting more demanding, and I had to decide was I staying with the show or continuing with my work life outside the show."
