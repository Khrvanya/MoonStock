U.S. Senate finance panel to consider USMCA trade pact on Tuesday1 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Finance Committee will meet on Tuesday to consider legislation to implement the new North American USMCA trade pact, the panel said in a statement on Friday. It said it would meet at 9:30 a.m. (1430 GMT). The U.S. House of Representatives signed off on the deal with Canada and Mexico on Dec. 19. Approval by the Senate committee would clear the legislation for consideration by the full Senate. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said the chamber would likely take it up after an impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.
