UK Government lays out ‘No-Deal’ immigration plansThe UK Government has set out what its immigration procedures will look like in the event of a 'No-Deal' Brexit.
The Government this week confirmed free movement as it currently stands will end on October 31.
A tougher UK criminality threshold will be applied for EEA citizens in order to keep out and deport those who commit crimes.
European migrants
The changes will be introduced alongside a new European Temporary Leave to Remain scheme (Euro TLR) for EEA and Swiss citizens and their close family members.
Citizens of those states moving to the UK after post-Brexit and up until the end of 2020 will be able to obtain a temporary immigration status lasting three years.
This will give businesses certainty that they will be able to recruit and retain staff after Brexit.
Points-based system
Home Secretary Priti Patel said: "On October 31, we will leave the EU come what may.
"Introducing tougher checks and ending free movement, as it currently stands, will allow us to take the first, historic steps towards taking back control of our borders.
In the future, we will introduce a new points-based immigration system built around the skills and talent people have - not where they are from.
Further measures to be introduced after 31 October 2019 include:


                            // googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1511797470075-0'); });

Applications for the scheme will open after the UK leaves the EU and will involve a simple online process and identity, security and criminality checks.
EU citizens will receive a digital status lasting three years allowing them to work and rent property.
Those wishing to stay on in the UK after their temporary status expires will need to make a further application under the new points-based immigration system.
Employers and landlords will not be required to distinguish between EU citizens who arrived before and after exit until the future immigration system is introduced from 2021.
For EU citizens who are living in the UK by October 31, 2019, and their families, they have until at least December 31, 2020, to make an application to the EU Settlement Scheme.
