UK dairy marketing campaign scoops international awardA UK dairy marketing campaign has been recognised as one of the best in the world at the World Dairy Summit in Istanbul.
The 'Department of Dairy Related Scrumptious Affairs' campaign, which was jointly funded by AHDB and Dairy UK, was awarded the International Milk Promotion Group Yves Boutonnat Trophy.
The campaign was chosen from a shortlist of three contenders, including the French and Swiss, as the best dairy advertisement.

The campaign used humour to remind people of their love of dairy, focusing on taste, enjoyment and the moments that make life better.

Targeting 20 to 35-year-old parents, the promotional activity featured social media, on-demand TV, digital outdoor billboards and cinema advertising, and was seen by 52.5 million people when it ran earlier this year.
Domestically, the campaign helped to drive a fall in the number of people cutting their dairy consumption, reduced intention to consume plant-based substitutes and increased the number of young parents who were certain to buy dairy products.
Stu Baker, AHDB senior marketing manager said: "I take huge delight knowing that the campaign is not only helping to shift attitudes towards dairy at home, but we've also been recognised as the creme de la creme on the world stage."

Commenting on the results, Dr. Judith Bryans, chief executive of Dairy UK added: "We're absolutely thrilled to have won this year's Yves Boutonnat Trophy.
"The Department of Dairy Related Scrumptious Affairs has been an excellent vehicle for creating positivity, humour and relevance about dairy amongst millennials, which has been reflected in our strong results yet again this year."
