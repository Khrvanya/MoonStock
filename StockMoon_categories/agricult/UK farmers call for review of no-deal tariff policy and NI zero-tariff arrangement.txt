UK farmers call for review of no-deal tariff policy and NI zero-tariff arrangementA British farmers' representative group has written to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, urging him to review the UK's no-deal trade tariffs - in particular for the island of Ireland.
The National Farmers' Union (NFU) has called for an urgent review of the UK government's no-deal trade tariff policy that would come into effect if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.
Under the current no-deal applied trade tariffs, the UK would be forced to trade on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, meaning UK farmers would face higher fees on exports such as 48% on lamb and 84% on beef, the NFU has said.
In the letter, NFU president Minette Batters reaffirmed the NFU's view that a no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for British farming and that any exiting of the EU must be smooth and orderly.
The NFU listed a number of requests for the prime minister regarding the trade policy.
These include:

Adjust the zero tariff that has been set on eggs, some dairy products, horticultural products and grains;
Review the zero-tariff arrangements for the land border on the island of Ireland;
Ensure detailed arrangements are in place for robust and timely market monitoring to understand the impact of the tariff regime and to enable remedial action adjusting tariffs if necessary.The National Farmers' Union (NFU) has called for an urgent review of the UK government's no-deal trade tariff policy that would come into effect if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.
