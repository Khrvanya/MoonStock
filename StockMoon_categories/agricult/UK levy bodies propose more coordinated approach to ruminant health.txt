UK levy bodies propose more coordinated approach to ruminant healthThe UK's levy boards have launched a consultation on proposals to form a Ruminant Health and Welfare Group to deliver a simpler, more co-ordinated approach to sheep and cattle health.
The consultation will be facilitated by:

The Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB);
Quality Meat Scotland (QMS);
Hybu Cig Cymru - Meat Promotion Wales (HCC); and
Livestock and Meat Commission for Northern Ireland (LMC).

Feedback will be used to assist with defining and supporting the next steps.
The bodies would like to hear from businesses and trade organisations involved in the cattle and sheep industry, including producers, processors, animal welfare groups, pharma businesses, academics and experts in the field of ruminant health and welfare.
Gwyn Jones, chairman of RUMA and AHDB Dairy Board, said: "Domestically, we face ongoing challenges over health and welfare and continuing high levels of endemic disease which erode reputation and public trust as well as margins.
In terms of the export of meat and dairy, there is a recognition that improving animal health and welfare status would enable the UK to access more markets.
"Discussions have been taking place across the cattle and sheep industry and with UK Governments over the last 12 months over how we can collectively accelerate the pace of progress on endemic disease in ruminants.

"There is broad agreement that a simpler, more co-ordinated approach to ruminant health and welfare is needed and that a united industry voice would be powerful and influential, in deciding spending priorities and champion innovation and best practice.
"The formation of an industry Ruminant Health and Welfare Group has been proposed to deliver this."
Alan Clarke, QMS chief executive, said: "Our farmers have some of the highest welfare standards across the globe however we are increasingly being faced with a backlash of ill-informed anti-red meat propaganda.
"The formation of this proposed group will help to strengthen the story we have to tell and enhance our high animal health and welfare standards. I'd encourage everyone across the industry to respond to the consultation to help form the next steps."
Ian Stevenson, LMC chief executive, added: "Regulatory responsibility for animal health and welfare is fully devolved however endemic diseases do not respect borders. It is, therefore, important that we work together to tackle ruminant health and welfare across the UK.
"Through a coordinated effort, sharing knowledge and experiences it is hoped that we will collectively be in a better position to meet the challenges that lie ahead."
Those interested can take part in the consultation on the AHDB website. The consultation closes at 5:00pm on Friday, October 25.
