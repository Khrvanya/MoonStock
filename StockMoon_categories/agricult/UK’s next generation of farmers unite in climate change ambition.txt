UK’s next generation of farmers unite in climate change ambitionThe UK's four farming Next Generation forums have come together this week to discuss how they can work together towards a lower carbon future.
The workshop, which followed the NFU's publication of its 'Achieving Net-zero' report earlier this month, considered what the industry's young farmers can do, what opportunities may arise in the future and what barriers will need to be overcome.
NFU Next Generation forum chairman Simon Gadd said: "Climate change is arguably one of the greatest challenges of our time and as the future of the industry we need to take it upon ourselves to start our journey towards net-zero now.
There are plenty of things we can do in the short-term to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions; precision farming, improving feed efficiency, better waste management and improving soil structure are just a few.
"There are also opportunities to increase carbon storage and renewable energy on farms.

"There will also be plenty of challenges, and working in partnership with the Government will be key to overcome these.
"For example, ensuring rural areas have full connectivity and broadband access will enable farm businesses to improve productivity - one of the pillars of the NFU's net-zero aspiration.
It's not just Government. The retailers and processors have a real role to play in reducing waste across the supply chain.
"The NFU's report is a starting block for the net-zero conversation to happen. The measures we take may be different from farm to farm, but by coming together we can share ideas and better understand how we can collectively step up to deliver climate-friendly food for the public"
