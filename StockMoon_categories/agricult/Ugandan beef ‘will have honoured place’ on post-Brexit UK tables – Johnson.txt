Ugandan beef ‘will have honoured place’ on post-Brexit UK tables – JohnsonUgandan beef cattle "will have an honoured place on the tables of post-Brexit", according to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
The prime minister made the remarks while giving an opening address at the UK-Africa Investment Summit in London last week on Monday, January 20.
Commenting on future prospects for trade, Johnson said:
"Of course we want to build a new future as a global free trading nation; that's what we are doing now and that's what we will be embarking on, on January 31, this month."
Continuing, the prime minister said: "I want to intensify and expand that trade in ways that go far beyond what we sell you or you sell us.
We want to go far beyond though, I have just told President Museveni of Uganda that his beef cattle will have an honoured place on the tables of post-Brexit Britain.
"But I want to go beyond that. Because what I am really talking about is building a partnership that benefits all of us."
