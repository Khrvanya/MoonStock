Update 1,984 new tractors registered in the Republic of Ireland last yearWe previously reported that registrations (which broadly equate to sales) of new tractors are "holding steady".
Figures (albeit provisional) released during recent weeks indicated that a total of 1,762 new tractors had been registered during 2018 - down 34 units on the figure for 2017 (1,796).
However, the Farm Tractor & Machinery Trade Association (FTMTA) has since been in contact - with an important update.

It appears that some tractors had previously been omitted from the total figure - possibly due to inconsistencies in the original raw data received by the FTMTA from the Revenue Commissioners.
It is now apparent that the number of new tractors registered in the Republic of Ireland last year (2018) was higher than previously reported - and by a significant margin. The revised figure is 1,984 units.
This table (below) shows the revised registration figures - on a month-by-month basis.

Update: New tractor registration figures for 2018 to be revised...upwards 




It appears that some tractors had previously been omitted from the total figure - possibly due to inconsistencies in the original raw data received by the FTMTA from the Revenue Commissioners.
It is now apparent that the number of new tractors registered in the Republic of Ireland last year (2018) was higher than previously reported - and by a significant margin. The revised figure is 1,984 units.
This table (below) shows the revised registration figures - on a month-by-month basis.
