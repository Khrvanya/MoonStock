Speculation is rife, though not yet confirmed, that the agreement involves Versatile's recently-unveiled Nemesis range (pictured).
The Nemesis was designed and developed by the Versatile team with an "emphasis on optimal value, performance and comfort".

The tractor is powered by a Cummins Stage V compliant QSB 6.7L engine and features a fully-electronic powershift transmission supplied by ZF. The Nemesis comes in three models (the 175, 190 and 210 - denoting the horsepower ratings).
Future models will feature a ZF CVT transmission, with power options up to 250hp.
"Many farms [in North America] use a tractor of this size for a wide range of tasks, including primary field work and front-end loader applications," explained Adam Reid, vice president of Sales and Marketing.

There are eight cab-mounted halogen lights and six hood-mounted lights.
Versatile says that the new styling of the Nemesis "establishes the design language for future products". The factory in Winnipeg (Canada) is now embarking on production of these tractors.
