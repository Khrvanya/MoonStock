"Increasing number of farmers realise the benefits and value added to their business from using a computerised feeding system," the statement added.
Commenting on her appointment, Una said: "I am really looking forward to the challenge of growing the Volac Ireland business further over the coming years.
At Volac, we place a huge emphasis on strong working relationships with farmers, merchants and co-ops.
"I am keen to build on these relationships - many of which Pat Cahill successfully initiated and developed over the years."
Volac recently invested EUR3.3 million in a milk replacer finishing plant at Mullagh, Kells, Co. Meath, which will employ up to 21 new manufacturing jobs.
The investment was supported by the Irish Government through Enterprise Ireland on this significant and strategic investment.
Una's appointment comes as Pat Cahill leaves Volac Ireland after close to 30 years' service.
