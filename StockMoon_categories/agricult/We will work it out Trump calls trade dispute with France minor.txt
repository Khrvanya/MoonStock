We will work it out Trump calls trade dispute with France minor1 Min ReadLONDON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was sure "a minor dispute" with France on trade could be worked out after he threatened to impose duties of up to 100% on imports of champagne, handbags and other French products. "We'll be talking about a lot of things including NATO and including trade ... We have had a minor dispute but I think we will probably be able to work it out," Trump said, sitting alongside French President Emmanuel Macron at a meeting of NATO leaders. "I am sure within a short period of time things will be looking very rosy, we hope. That's usually the case between the two of us - we get it worked out."
