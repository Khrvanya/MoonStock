It will open for registration from Wednesday, August 14 until 5:00pm on Monday, September 30 and allow professional users to safely and confidentially dispose of unwanted, out-of-date or now unlicensed pesticides and other chemicals.
FUW policy officer Bernard Griffiths said: "If you find that you have out of date or now unlicensed products on your farm, which can be difficult or expensive to dispose of correctly, then we would urge you to register for this scheme.
"Of course pesticides form an essential and everyday role in the agricultural community but if stored, used or disposed of incorrectly, they can have a devastating impact on people, water and wildlife."
