What are the 7 key characteristics of a highly-profitable dairy farmerThe expansion of the national dairy herd has paved the way for dairy farmers to increase their margins in recent years. The abolition of the milk quotas coupled with better systems has allowed dairy farmers to increase their farm's bottom line.
Speaking at Irish Grassland Association's (IGA) Dairy Conference - which took place earlier today in Co. Cork - agricultural consultant and land agent Mike Brady outlined that a high-profit dairy farmer earns more than EUR100,000 profit/year.
During his presentation, which was titled 'key characteristics of highly-profitable dairy farms', he highlighted that this figure is based on a 40ha holding.
This is the national average size of Irish dairy farms milking 100 cows and achieving a net profit based on Teagasc Moorepark research figures of EUR2,500/ha.
