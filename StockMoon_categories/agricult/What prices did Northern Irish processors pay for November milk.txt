Commenting on the price, a Lakeland Dairies spokesperson said:
"The global dairy market has remained steady over the past number of weeks. Demand for products remains a challenge in some areas but there have been signs of stability in recent weeks, particularly for powders.
As we approach 2020, the fundamentals in the dairy markets are reasonable with demand stable.
"Lakeland Dairies will continue to monitor the market situation closely over the coming weeks," the cooperative spokesperson concluded.
