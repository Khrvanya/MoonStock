Where will the deluge of dairy bull calves go this springWith calving season just around the corner, concerns are mounting that calf rings in marts will soon swell with dairy bull calves.
However, as significant levels of uncertainty continue to linger over the profitability of beef enterprises, some farmers have suggested alternative options for the incoming dairy calves.
Spokesperson for the Beef Plan Movement, Eamon Corley, explained to AgriLand what he believes are viable alternatives for dairy bull calves.

The introduction of a 14-day-old slaughter option for the lowest quality calves;
The easing of export regulations for calves.However, as significant levels of uncertainty continue to linger over the profitability of beef enterprises, some farmers have suggested alternative options for the incoming dairy calves.
