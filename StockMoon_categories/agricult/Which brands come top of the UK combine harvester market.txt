Which brands come top of the UK combine harvester marketClaas is the top-selling combine harvester brand (for new machine sales/registrations) in the UK - by quite some margin.
That's according to data from the UK-based AEA (Agricultural Engineers Association).
It has released figures relating to sales for the 2017 season; the data covers registrations from September 2016 until August 2017.
Why, you might ask, are we revealing the brand-by-brand figures for 2017 (rather than 2018)? Official bodies are not permitted to release such data due to EU competition regulations until a full 12 months have elapsed.
The data shows that Claas sold (registered) 263 new combine harvesters, accounting for 48% of the market.
