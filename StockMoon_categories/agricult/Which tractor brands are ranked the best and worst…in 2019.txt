Which tractor brands are ranked the best and worst…in 2019A 'European dealer satisfaction survey' for 2019 has turned up some interesting findings; in which major tractor manufacturers (brands) have effectively been ranked against several criteria.
There is also an aggregate (overall) ranking, which pits the big brands head-to-head.
The data is from a CLIMMAR survey. CLIMMAR is a network of farm machinery dealer organisations across much of Europe.
The survey encompassed participating dealers from 10 countries. Over 1,000 respondents reportedly took part - up significantly from the last such survey in 2018.
Brand-by-brand results
For overall (average) dealer satisfaction, Fendt was the highest-ranked manufacturer (14.4% - across all combined criteria).
Source: CLIMMAR
Next up was Kubota (14.1%); followed by John Deere (13.5%); and then Same (13.4%). Languishing lower down the table were Massey Ferguson (12.5%) and New Holland (11.9%).
'Brand image'
Among the individual criteria (that contribute to the overall ranking), perhaps the single most important was 'brand image and impact'.
Dealers were also asked to rate each manufacturer solely on this basis. The results are shown in this chart (below).

Fendt was also the highest-ranked manufacturer on this specific criterion (17.4%). Next up was John Deere (16.7%); followed by Kubota and Valtra (both at 15.0%).
'After-sales service and warranty'
Another important criterion was 'after-sales service and warranty'. Dealers' rankings (for this specifically) are detailed in this chart (below).
