Why do some farmers make the switch to once-a-day milkingA growing number of farmers are giving serious consideration to once-a-day (OAD) milking; that was the general consensus at today's Teagasc once-a-day milking conference in Co. Tipperary.
Following on from the success of last year's event, another packed house in the Horse and Jockey Hotel was witnessed.
Farmers - a mixture of established dairy farmers and potential converts from beef farming - attended the event to hear about the 'pros' and 'cons' of OAD milking.
Many travelled to find out if OAD milking could be a potential solution to ease some of the pressures associated with modern-day, spring-calving, dairy systems.
In the coming weeks, dairy farmers will enter into a peak-pressure period - which will only intensify with a move towards a 90% six-week calving rate.
The benefits and potential downfalls of OAD milking were discussed at length. Brian Hilliard, the organiser of today's event, has undertaken extensive work in this area over the years.
Why consider OAD milking?
While there was a lot of interest in the conference, only 70 farmers in Ireland currently operate a OAD milking system.
During Brian's presentation, he said: "We had more and more queries last year because of the labour issues on farms; some farmers can't get good labour. This was especially evident last year, given the difficult [conditions].
"Lifestyle is another huge factor when it comes to OAD milking. Some people are tired of being tied down milking cows twice-a-day (TAD), seven days a week, but OAD really changes that. It also might make farming more attractive to their sons or daughters."

Brian also touched on walking distance from the parlour as a reason why farmers are making the switch, stating "it's a lot easier moving cows long or hilly distances when milking OAD and there is less lameness".
"Some people have switched so they can make better use of an outlet farm; some farmers are establishing a second unit and milking OAD on this block," he explained.

Other reasons Brian highlighted included: an off-farm job; drystock or beef farmers converting to dairy farming; and as a way of retiring and reducing the workload.
