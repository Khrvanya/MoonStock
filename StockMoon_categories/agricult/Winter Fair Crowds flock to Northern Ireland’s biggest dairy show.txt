Winter Fair Crowds flock to Northern Ireland’s biggest dairy showThousands of farmers have already made their way through the doors of this year's Royal Ulster Winter Fair today (November 12, 2019).
Competition in the ring is likely to be stiff this year with cow numbers up 11% this year with 154 animals entered.
Last year's supreme champion breeder Cyril Dowling has made it back up the A1 again from Dublin, but this with FM Renita. This year's entry is by Baldonnel Flashmatic - the same sire as last year's winner.
Reserve champion locally-bred Ardmore Janet 110 from Crumlin Ayrshire breeder John Hunter is also back again along with the 2018 Jersey and Dairy Shorthorn champions.
Today's show (December 12) also marks the 34th year the show has run in association with its sole sponsor Danske Bank.
