Woodland Trust helps tree restoration on farmland near Kilkeel30 tree cages are being installed in Kilkeel as part of a woodland restoration project in the area.
Michael Topping from the Woodland Trust in Northern Ireland is working with contractor Patrick McLean and a private landowner to replant trees in farming landscapes.
Woodland Trust has said that its aim is to protect and maintain tree cover in Northern Ireland. This project is just at the trialing stage at the minute, but with the ultimate goal of collaborating with more farmers in the future.
The cages will protect up to 120 native trees, such as oak and downy birch, from browsing cattle, as the lands continue to be grazed.
Fight against climate change
Eventually, these trees, once fully grown, will support a greater diversity of wildlife and provide natural shelter for cattle and sheep.
