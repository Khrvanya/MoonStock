‘46% of Irish soils require lime, 59% are deficient in P and 49% are deficient in K’It is no secret that having soils at optimum pH and at the correct levels for phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) can improve the quality of grass grown on Irish suckler and beef farms.
However, speaking at the recent suckler cow conference in Castlebar, Co. Mayo, Teagasc's John Noonan outlined that 46% of Irish soils require lime, 59% are deficient in P and 49% are deficient in K.
Therefore, there is plenty of scope for improvement and he recommended getting soils sampled and - from there - slurry and fertiliser can be targeted at specific paddocks in order to increase P and K levels if needs be; he also noted that lime should be spread where required.
"25% extra production can be achieved by getting P, K and lime levels right," he explained.
More from grass
Grass is plentiful on the majority of beef farms at the minute and every effort should be made to get some of this grass into animals' diets.
While heavier farms may still have soft ground conditions, lighter stock can be turned out. If weather deteriorates, animals can always be re-housed.
However, grass will be very beneficial to the animal and getting stock out to pasture is a saving on winter feed supplies and reduces the housing period.
Housed animals cost more money in terms of feed; grass is five times cheaper than meal and three times cheaper than silage.
John noted that farmers need to target 280-300 days at grass. Naturally, every farm is different and the weather has a big part to play when it comes to this target, but maximising the grazing season is very important, he said.
