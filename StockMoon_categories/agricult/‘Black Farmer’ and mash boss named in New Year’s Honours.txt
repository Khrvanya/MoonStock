‘Black Farmer’ and mash boss named in New Year’s HonoursThe 'Black Farmer', a vet who helped Scotland achieve TB-free status, and a prominent Northern Ireland agri-businesswoman are among those in food and farming on the 2020 New Year's Honours List.
The New Year's Honours recognises the outstanding achievements of people across the UK.
Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones - also known as 'The Black Farmer' - will be made an MBE for services to British Farming.
Emmanuel-Jones was born in Jamaica but moved to Birmingham with his parents in 1961.
His successful television career gave him the capital to buy Higher West Kitcham Farm, on the border of Devon and Cornwall in St. Giles on the Heath, Launceston, which he continues to farm.
He was given the nickname 'The Black Farmer' by locals who helped him, which inspired him to set up a food brand of the same name.
He has since become involved in setting up the Black Farmer Scholarship, which aims to help and encourage ethnic minorities to work in the rural community.
The scholarship was featured on Channel 4 series 'Young Black Farmers', which sees him show a group of nine inner-city school leavers from ethnic minorities how to work on his Devon farm.

Co. Down woman Tracy Hamilton (pictured centre) co-founded prepared vegetable firm Mash Direct as a means to make her family's farm profitable.
Today, the business is one of the most successful examples of farm diversification in the region, exporting its potato and root vegetable products as shipped as far apart as New York and Dubai.
Since it was founded in 2004, Mash Direct has grown from 70ac to 1,400ac and now employs almost 200 people.
Hamilton was awarded an MBE for her services to the Northern Ireland Agri-Food Sector.
Gloucestershire dairy farmer Tim Merrett, was also among those in line for an MBE.
Merrett is one of three farmers working closely with rural education charity Countryside Classroom to facilitate farm visits for local school children and will be given the honour for his services to education.
The charity uses the visits to teach children about food, farming and the natural environment.
Peter Barfoot, founder and chairman of Barfoots of Botley made the list for services to Sustainable Farming.
The Hampshire semi-exotics grower started out in 1976 and today farms 7,000ac in the UK and 2,500ac in Senegal. In 2007, 35 million cobs were harvested from the company's farms in Hampshire.
Other well-known faces in farming include Royal Highland and Agricultural Society chairman Willie Gill, who will be made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his services to the Agriculture Sector in Scotland.
