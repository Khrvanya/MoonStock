‘Chris’ the record-breaking sheep diesA sheep that broke records in recent years for the world's heaviest fleece has died, it has emerged.
The sheep, named "Chris", died on Monday, October 21, aged 10, according to Australian animal charity Little Oak Sanctuary.
Chris was discovered wandering the bushlands of Canberra, in Australia, in 2015 with an enormous fleece weighing 41kg - a record-breaking weight.
According to Little Oak, it is estimated that the sheep had been lost for five years, leading to the build-up in his fleece.
It was marvelled that the animal managed to survive with the build-up in wool as even one year of fleece growth can be dangerous for sheep in very hot weather, characteristic of the Aussie bushlands, due to heat stress and flystrike.
Arrests following discovery of migrants in cattle truck
Meanwhile, five men have been arrested as part of a National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation into a crime group suspected of hiding migrants in a cattle truck in a bid to smuggle them into the UK from mainland Europe.
