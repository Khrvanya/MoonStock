‘Cream of crop’ expected at Cork AgTech ConventionThe upcoming Agtech Convention promises to bring the "cream of the crop" from the agricultural technology sector to the limelight.
Being hosted in conjunction with Local Enterprise Week 2019, the free event - which takes place at the Fota Island Resort on March 6 - is aimed at promoting the technology requirements of the agricultural industry, according to organisers.
The Cork event, titled 'AgTech - The Future of Sustainable Agricultural Business', will outline the importance of AgTech to solve many of the issues facing the agricultural industry.
The line-up for the event includes the CEOs of a number of Irish agritech firms.
Founder and CEO of Herdwatch Fabien Peyaud will give a keynote speech on the future challenges and opportunities perceived in the continued evolution of AgTech.
Other prominent CEOs will be part of an "AgTech Start Up Panel" including Dr. Eoghan Finneran, CEO of FarmEye and Padraig Hennessy, CEO of Terra NutriTech.
