‘Make your voice heard’ National survey launched on rural policing and crimeRural campaigning organisation - the Countryside Alliance - has launched a national survey ahead of the Police and Crime Commissioner elections in May 2020.
The survey will close on March 29, 2020, with the objective of gaining insight into what rural people think about rural policing and crime.
Crime has always been a key issue throughout the countryside, but it has risen further up the agenda of rural concerns over the last few years.
The extent of rural crime is only part of the problem. It has been said that for many people, whether they have fallen victim to crime or not, the simple fear of crime can have a detrimental effect on their quality of life.
It has been suggested that anticipation of crime has the potential to cause greater harm than the actual experience of crime itself. This is due to the effect of long-term stress and other mental health considerations.
All of this is only exacerbated by rural isolation.
Effective partnerships
"Good rural policing is about far more than numbers of police officers on the ground," said Sarah Lee of the Countryside Alliance.
If we truly want to tackle rural crime, then we must form effective partnerships between the police, rural communities and other authorities.
"We are seeking the views of those who live, work or regularly visit rural areas on crime and policing.

"Take part in our rural policing survey and tell us about any crimes that have been committed against you, including ones that were not reported to the police.
How did they make you feel? Did the police respond appropriately?
"It is important that you make your voice heard ahead of the Police and Crime Commissioner elections on Thursday, May 7; if you want to influence how rural policing is prioritised in your community."
The Countryside Alliance will be presenting the results of this survey to all of the candidates of the forthcoming Police and Crime Commissioner elections to ensure that they understand the needs, concerns and priorities of rural communities.
The survey is short and responses are anonymous. A link to the survey can be found here.
