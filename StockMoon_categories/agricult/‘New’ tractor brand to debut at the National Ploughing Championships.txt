‘New’ tractor brand to debut at the National Ploughing ChampionshipsA tractor brand that is new to Ireland will likely be unveiled at this year's National Ploughing Championships (close to Fenagh, Co. Carlow) next month.
The entity is Basak Tractor - a Turkish manufacturer that is attempting to expand into western Europe. The company already showed off its wares at the Royal Highland Show in Scotland some time ago (June 20-23).

This tractor (pictured above and below - at the Royal Highland Show) is the Basak 5120; it's the newest offering from the company.

This model is apparently home to a (circa) 120hp (3.6L) Deutz engine and a ZF transmission that incorporates a partial powershift.
The Turkish-based manufacturer is also expected to bring a telescopic handler (pictured below) to this year's National Ploughing Championships.

It's worth noting that Basak has been involved in the tractor business since at least the 1960s - originally in a licensing agreement with Ford.
Later it moved on to building Steyr-branded models in the mid-to-late 1970s, before starting to manufacture its own-brand machines in 1996.

In 2012, the company became part of Sanko Group (which reportedly employs over 14,000 people). The tractor factory is located in Sakarya; annual production capacity is apparently up to 10,000 units (though actual production levels are some way shy of this).

The company's stated mission is to "supply quality and efficient tractors - to increase market share".
Meanwhile, preparations are ongoing for this year's National Ploughing Championships - the 88th in the event's long history. It will kick off on Tuesday, September 17, and run until Thursday, September 19.
