‘Simplified’ Countryside Stewardship scheme opens for 2021 applicationsApplications for the Countryside Stewardship (CS) scheme have opened today (February 11), offering the chance for more farmers to be paid for their environmental work.
The scheme rewards farmers for environmental work ranging from restoring wildlife habitats and creating woodlands to managing flood risk.
A spokesman for Defra explained applying this year was the best way to prepare for the Government's future Environmental Land Management (ELM) Scheme.
Under the proposed scheme farmers will be rewarded for producing 'public goods', such as better air and water quality or improved access to the countryside.
The Government will be rolling out a national pilot in 2021 to test how ELM works on the ground, with the scheme expected to be fully operational by the end of 2024.
CS provides a stepping stone to this future, paying for environmental enhancements now as area-based payments are phased out.
Those signed up to CS who secure a place in the ELM pilot from 2021, or wish to enter the scheme when it is fully rolled out from 2024, will be able to leave their agreements at agreed exit points, without penalty.
Farming Minister George Eustice said: "Paying farmers for protecting the environment and enhancing animal welfare is front and centre of our future farming policy and entering a Countryside Stewardship Scheme is a good stepping stone to that future policy.
There is nothing to be gained by holding back. We are guaranteeing that anyone who joins our new scheme in the future will be able to leave their CS agreement early in order to do so.
For the 2019 claim year, final payments started to arrive with customers four months earlier than in previous years after the Rural Payments Agency made the change for agreement holders to receive one full revenue payment, rather than a 75% payment followed by a 25% payment.
Rural Payments Agency chief executive Paul Caldwell said: "We are continuously making Countryside Stewardship easier to apply for and simpler to administer, with full CS payments arriving in bank accounts much earlier this year than in previous years.
The application window this year is a great opportunity to get into a scheme that is improving all the time, and which rewards farmers and land managers for their vital work to protect our countryside and enhance the environment for generations to come.
"I'd encourage farmers and their agents to complete their applications and claims promptly and ensure they are submitted by the deadline."
Farmers and land managers who are new to taking on environmental work or with expired or expiring Environmental Stewardship agreements can apply for:
