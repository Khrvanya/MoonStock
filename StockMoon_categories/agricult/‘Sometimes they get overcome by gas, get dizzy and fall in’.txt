‘Sometimes they get overcome by gas, get dizzy and fall in’Farmers will begin to spread slurry around the country next week. First and foremost in their minds should be safety.
Spreading slurry is one of the most dangerous tasks on a farm. From 2008-2017, 210 people died on Irish farms and 10% - 20 people - of these deaths occurred by drowning or gas poisoning.
According to the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), drowning is the most common cause of death involving slurry. Children and the elderly are most at risk.
From 2000-2010, 30 of child farm fatalities were caused by drowning in slurry or water. 8% of deaths to elderly farmers in this time were caused by drowning.
Hydrogen sulphide has no smell and one lung-full of this gas can kill instantly.

Pat outlined a set of slurry-spreading guidelines to AgriLand earlier this week.
