In a letter from Junker to the European Council's President Donald Tusk, he said: "The negotiators reached an agreement on a revised protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland and a revised political declaration on October 17, 2019.
"Both were endorsed by the European Commission. The prime minister of the UK also signalled his approval of these documents to me today."
DUP doubts
Meanwhile, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has issued a statement this morning, Thursday, October 17, outlining that the party "could not support what is being suggested".
The statement from Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds noted: "We have been involved in ongoing discussions with the Government.
As things stand, we could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues and there is a lack of clarity on VAT.
Concluding, the statement added: "We will continue to work with the Government to try and get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland and protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the UK."
The statement from the DUP comes ahead of today's EU summit in Brussels.
