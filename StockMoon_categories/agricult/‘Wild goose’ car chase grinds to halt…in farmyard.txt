‘Wild goose’ car chase grinds to halt…in farmyardA car chase which turned into a "wild goose chase" came to a dead end in a farmyard over the weekend, according to An Garda Siochana.
A car was seen by Gardai turning around and driving away from a Garda checkpoint in Co. Donegal, prompting officers of Letterkenny Roads Policing Unit (RPU) to give chase, tracking the fleeing Ford Focus.
The driver was eventually stopped after driving into a farmyard, bringing the pursuit to an end.
Following a check, it transpired that the driver did not hold a full driver's licence, possessing a learner permit with no learner 'L' plates up.
The car was seized and a Fixed Charge Penalty Notice (FCPN) issued.
Giving an account of the matter on social media, the An Garda Siochana Twitter page said: "Letterkenny RPU: 'We're behind you' - well in fairness you couldn't miss us!
