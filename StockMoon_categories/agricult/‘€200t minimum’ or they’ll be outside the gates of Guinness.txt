‘ˆ200t minimum’ or they’ll be outside the gates of GuinnessGrowers supplying Boortmalt want a minimum price of EUR200/t. It might seem like the same old broken record - malting barley farmers aren't happy, but attending a grower's meeting last night it struck this AgriLand reporter that this time was different.
The farmers in attendance were at the end of their tether and they were unwilling to accept the deal put in front of them which had been negotiated between Boortmalt and the IFA malting barley committee.
Many farmers stated that Boortmalt was "playing them".
One member of the committee stated that he felt they had been "dragged" along until Christmas and now are faced with a deal they are not happy with in February.
Many farmers reiterated this point stating that the deal is in front of them a month before planting.

Call from the floor
The main call from the floor was for a minimum price of EUR200/t for malting barley. Growers stated that they will stand behind the IFA malting barley committee and will travel to St. James's Gate to protest if a better deal is not finalised.
The malting barley committee will meet with Boortmalt again on Wednesday (February 6) and leaving the meeting last night the understanding was that growers will meet once again next Monday night (February 11) and the Monday after if needed.
Chairman of the committee, Mark Browne, was encouraged by the crowd in attendance, but asked members to come back next week with another person to ramp up the support.
