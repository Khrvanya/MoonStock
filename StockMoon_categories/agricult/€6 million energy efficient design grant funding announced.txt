ˆ6 million energy efficient design grant funding announcedApplications to the SEAI Excellence in Energy Efficient Design (EXEED) Scheme are open, Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment Richard Bruton has announced.
A fund of up to EUR6 million is available for projects delivering best practice in the design, construction and management of buildings for optimum energy efficiency.
Successful applicants will be currently in the design phase of planning capital projects for new or existing buildings.
Energy savings in excess of 30% are common and in addition to the energy and climate impacts, the SEAI EXEED certification will assist businesses to become more efficient, competitive and resilient.
In order to qualify for a grant, participants must follow the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) EXEED standard and embed energy efficiency measures in the design of their projects.
The grant is open to public and private organisations who are planning an investment project of any scale or complexity.
According to the SEAI, the grant therefore doesn't support single retrofit projects but rather full asset energy performance.
The energy saving potential is proportionate to the level of ambition, challenge to existing design norms and investment.
According to the organisers, the EXCEED grant support is:
