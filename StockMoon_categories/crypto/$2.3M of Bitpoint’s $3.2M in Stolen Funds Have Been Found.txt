It appeared as though the agency might have been gaining momentum in granting the licensure last week due to the relaxation of restrictions placed on crypto exchange Bitlfyer, but the Bitpoint hack could give the agency a bit of pause.Finance Magnates reported last week that over 100 cryptocurrency exchanges are currently in the process of applying for licensure from the FSA.
