AMF of France Report ICOs Account for ‘Marginal’ Share of MarketThe Autorite des marches financiers, France's financial regulator, has released a report on initial coin offerings. The study reveals that while ICO financing has continued to grow in terms of money raised, it remains "marginal" in proportion to the rest of the market.It says that since 2014, 19.4 billion euros has been raised by selling crypto-tokens. Of this figure, EUR5.6 billion was taken in 2017, and EUR13.4 billion in the first three quarters of 2018.Join the iFX EXPO Asia and discover your gateway to the Asian MarketsThe figure in 2017 is equal to only 1.6 percent of the equity finance market.French startups have raised only EUR89 million raised, from 15 ICOs.
