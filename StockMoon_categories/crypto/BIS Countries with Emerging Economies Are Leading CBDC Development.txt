BIS Countries with Emerging Economies Are Leading CBDC DevelopmentResearches at the Bank of International Settlements, an international financial institution owned by central banks that is designed to foster international monetary and financial cooperation said in a report on Thursday, January 23rd, that 80 percent of central banks all around the work are "undertaking extensive work on central bank digital currencies."The survey, which was conducted to determine global interest in central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), included results from sixty-six central banks collected over the latter half of 2019. The banks were located in both emerging and developed economies.Discover iFX EXPO Asia 2020 in Macao - The Largest Financial B2B ExpoThe results of the survey showed that most of the work being done on central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, is in the experimental and proof-of-concept stages: "the survey corroborates the findings from last year's exercise, especially that a wide variety of motivations drives extensive central bank research and experimentation on CBDCs," the report said.However, "only a few EME (emerging market economy) central banks have progressed to intensive development (e.g. developing the operational arrangements for a CBDC and/or amending laws to allow the central bank to issue one) or pilot projects and have firm intentions to issue a CBDC soon. Nonetheless, their plans appear to be accelerating compared with earlier expectations."Emerging market economies report stronger motivations and a higher likelihood to issue #CBDC than advanced economies.

The continued high level of uncertainty is not surprising, given that most central bank mandates predate many forms of electronic money."Last July, the Financial Times reported that BIS general manager Agustin Carstens said that "many central banks are working on it; we are working on [] supporting them."Central bank group to assess potential cases for central bank digital currencies #CBDC #fintech https://t.co/gosKZ25uCX pic.twitter.com/zopE5tnNpG-- Bank for International Settlements (@BIS_org) January 21, 2020"And it might be that it is sooner than we think that there is a market and we need to be able to provide central bank digital currencies."Still, Carstens explained that "there needs to be evidence for demand... and it is not clear that the demand is there yet. Perhaps people can do what they want by using electronic wallets provided by banks or fintech companies. It depends on the development of payment systems."The debate about central banks issuing digital currencies is not primarily about convenience and digitisation; rather, about fundamental changes to both parts of the system that central banks oversee: money and payments - Carstens #CBDC @centralbank_ie https://t.co/XsdmPdwIrE pic.twitter.com/gQB4frBOKJ-- Bank for International Settlements (@BIS_org) March 22, 2019Indeed, the most recent report issued by the BIS also said that "there is no evidence of a widespread or general move to expand this research into experimentation and pilot arrangements. However, a few central banks with sufficient motivation are proceeding to pilot various designs."Still, "for most people around the world, a general purpose or wholesale CBDC is still unlikely in their jurisdiction in the medium term."
