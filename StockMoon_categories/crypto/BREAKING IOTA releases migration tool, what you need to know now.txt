BREAKING IOTA releases migration tool, what you need to know nowMore than two weeks have passed since the IOTA Foundation received information about the hack of the Trinity Wallet, where according to current information, 8.55 Ti (8,550,000,000,000 IOTA), approximately 2.37 million US dollars were stolen.Within a few hours, the IOTA Foundation officials decided to eliminate the currently still existing central component of the IOTA Tangle, the Coordinator. This led to the consequence that no more value transactions could be carried out.With today's release of the migration tool this situation will not change for the time being. However, there is now a foreseeable time horizon when the IOTA Tangle will run again. The migration tool gives all potentially affected users of the Trinity Wallet the opportunity to migrate their old wallet seed to a new one within seven days. The migration phase will run from 29 February 2020 to 07 March 2020.The purpose of the tool is easily explained. If two people in the migration phase try to migrate the same seed to a new seed, a KYC process will be triggered. Both persons have to identify themselves personally at the IOTA Foundation by means of identity documents. This prevents the hacker from stealing further MIOTA even after the tangle of stolen seeds has been put into operation.As soon as the migration phase ends, the IOTA Foundation will "construct a valid tangle" by creating a new snapshot with the submitted new seeds. Before the coordinator is engaged, the node operators must manually download the snapshot in the next step. Then the coordinator can be switched on again, once the migration phase has ended.All Trinity Wallet users should ask themselves whether they have used the IOTA Wallet in the period from 17 December 2019 to 17 February 2020. If so, the use of the migration tool also depends on which version was used. Only versions 1.2.0, 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 are not affected by the security vulnerability, the MoonPay integration, and do not require the use of the migration tool.In case of doubt, however, it should always be used. The following overview will help you to make a decision.Source: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/408002162841354250/680438207732514892/Chart_Trinity.pngPut simply, three steps are necessary: The Trinity Wallet needs to be updated to the latest version, the migration tool needs to be downloaded, and then follow the tool's explanations.
