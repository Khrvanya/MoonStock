The list includes block trades; a fee holiday through the end of the year; market maker incentive programs to encourage liquid markets; and integrations with ISVs and regulated brokerage platforms.In addition, price formation in these benchmark contracts will be supported by professional tools to detect abusive or disruptive trading practices, including wash trades.CEO Kelly Loeffler confirmed last month that Bakkt plans to start user acceptance testing (UAT) for futures and custody this summer, which was a strong indication on how she's confident to settle the remaining issues with the US regulators. From the Bakkt's perspective, however, this action only aims to ensure providing prospective clients with sufficient time to onboard and test its trading and custody models.And in order to placate the CFTC, the physical delivery and storage of bitcoin will be provided by Bakkt's qualified custodian. This was the issue that has made the agency most concerned about the NYSE owner's product as crypto assets have been vulnerable to the risks of possible theft and manipulation.
