"We submitted the application pretty fast. Binance's Singapore entity has been in close touch with the local regulators, and they have always been open-minded."As Finance Magnates reported, Singapore introduced the Payment Services Act (PSA) last month, updating its existing framework for crypto regulations.With this, the crypto companies come under the direct purview of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which will oversee platforms for provisions in anti-money laundering and counter-terror financing.The new framework also provided the businesses a window of one month to register with the regulator and another six months to seek a payment institution's license.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Binance already has a Singapore entity, and it also serves the traders of the city-state with fiat-based trading options.Apart from Binance, two other exchanges - Tokyo-based crypto exchange operator Liquid and London-headquartered Luno - also showed interest in receiving the same license from the Singapore regulator.Notably, Luno re-entered the Singapore market last November after almost three years of exile.Singapore is one of Asia's friendly jurisdictions for the incubation of blockchain and crypto startups.
