Binance Delists BCHSV, CEO Calls Craig Wright “a Fraud”Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, announced on Monday that it is delisting Bitcoin SV (BCHSV).The announcement came after Binance's chief executive officer, Changpeng Zhao, said that one of the key figures behind the coin - Craig Wright - is "a fraud."Discover Barcelona Trading Conference - A Top Tier Crypto Trading EventWright will be familiar to many in the world of cryptocurrency as the man who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto - the mysterious figure who invented bitcoin a decade ago.A month ago, Wright quit Twitter in a rage after users on the site continually accused him of being a fraud.He followed that up by sending 'cease and desist-style' letters to anyone who said that he was a liar.That caught the attention - and ire - of Zhao."Craig Wright is not Satoshi," the Binance CEO tweeted on Friday.

"This is as simple as breathing for him/her. And we have the pub key. Until then, everyone is Satoshi, except Craig Wright!"
