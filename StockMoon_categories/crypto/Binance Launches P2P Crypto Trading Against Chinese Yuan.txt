The exchange is also planning to open an over-the-counter market, primarily supporting the Chinese yuan.In late 2017, the Chinese government put a blanket ban on initial coin offerings and centralized crypto exchanges, driving all of these businesses out of the country overnight. China was seeing the highest volume in crypto trades prior to the ban.With this, the Chinese crypto traders moved towards the peer-to-peer and OTC markets, which are still tolerated by the Chinese government and Binance is trying to capture both the markets.In September, Binance, which is one of the largest crypto exchanges in terms of adjusted trade volumes, also invested in one of the major crypto-focused media firms in China.Meanwhile, the Chinese central bank is also planning to introduce a digital currency, which can be seen as a digitized version of its fiat.
