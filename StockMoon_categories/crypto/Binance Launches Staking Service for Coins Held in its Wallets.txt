Binance Launches Staking Service for Coins Held in its WalletsCryptocurrency exchange Binance has officially launched its own staking platform, which allows clients to tap into rewards offered by certain types of cryptocurrencies running on proof-of-stake networks.Staking, the company explained, enables users to earn dividends or interest on their digital assets for validating transactions and also allows them to vote on changes in the blockchain. Users are rewarded for simply depositing and holding coins on Binance as they normally would.London Summit 2019 Launches the Latest Era in FX and Fintech - Join Now"With Staking, Binance users will be able to grow their funds by receiving monthly rewards & distributions simply by depositing and holding funds on Binance.
