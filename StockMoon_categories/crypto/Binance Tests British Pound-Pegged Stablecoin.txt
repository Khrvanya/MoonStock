Binance is one of the largest digital asset exchange on the globe and, per Coinmarketcap.com data, handled $2.4 billion worth crypto trades in the last 24 hours.Stablecoins allow exchanges to bypass strict fiat trading requirements and the base physical asset restricts wild price swings as seen with Bitcoin or other digital currencies. These coins gained massive popularity in recent years as they provide fiat-like trading experience.The major exchange is now eying the lucrative market for stablecoins. A subsidiary of current market leader OKEx recently partnered with US-based crypto custodian Prime Trust and launched a stablecoin called USDK.Traditional stock exchanges are also diving into the stablecoin market as Swiss exchange SIX recently revealed that it is working on the development of a Swiss franc-pegged cryptocurrency.Moreover, authorities in many jurisdictions also see potential in stablecoins. Last month, the governor of the Bank of France revealed that the central bank is taking interest in stablecoins while it is still hostile towards cryptocurrencies.Meanwhile, Binance recently came under fire as it is blocking access to its newly launched decentralized crypto exchange Binance DEX for traders based in 29 countries including the United States.
