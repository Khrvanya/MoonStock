It has since set up offices all over the world, such as in Malta, Jersey, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea, to name a few. It has millions of users, and CEO Changpeng Zhao said that he expects to see a net profit of $1 billion at the end of 2018.More recently, it decided in favour of the original Bitcoin Cash in the ongoing Bitcoin Cash civil war.Its presence in these different countries means that it has to be aware of the developing regulation situation in each. KYC is usually a minimum requirement for a licensed financial institution, and Binance's new software is another sign of the institutionalisation of digital currency.However, many would argue that this measure is not in keeping with the philosophy of cryptocurrency (most related companies are not compliant), so it will be interesting to see how Binance's new software affects its business.
