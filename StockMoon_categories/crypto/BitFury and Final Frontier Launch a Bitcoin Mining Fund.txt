However, the situation became worse for all miners as the price of the digital currency plummeted since 2018. With high electricity costs, it turned out to be a loss-making venture for most of the miners.However, the recent rise in Bitcoin prices is encouraging the miners again to indulge in crypto mining.Last year, the San Francisco-based blockchain company raised $80 million from a number of private investors. The company was even valued at $1 billion - making it one of the largest crypto-based ventures on the globe.Bitfury also extended its operations massively in the overseas market recently as, earlier this year, it partnered with Seoul-based Commons Foundations to open and operate bitcoin transaction processing centers in Paraguay.Meanwhile, the Chinese authorities are considering to ban cryptocurrency mining within the country altogether. The state planning agency recently released a draft proposal and included crypto mining in the list of activities which violated the laws of the jurisdiction.
