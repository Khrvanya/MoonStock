After the minute passed, "connections continued undergoing a 1% failure rate of commands until servers recovered at 02:47:00 UTC."The "rolling restart" of the servers that ended the outage may have also caused a temporary delay in response times for some of the exchange's market data REST points.The second pair of outages lasted for 30 seconds apiece and took place starting almost exactly three hours later at 05:48 UTC and 06:10 UTC, respectively.The exchange's post explains that during these 30-second periods, requests to the trading engine were "load-shed" by the trading engine, which was busy at the time. Load-shedding is when action is taken to reduce the load on something; the term usually refers to the interruption of electricity to prevent an overload on the generating plant.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>According to BitMEX' post, the trading engine's preoccupation was not because of a surplus of traffic.
