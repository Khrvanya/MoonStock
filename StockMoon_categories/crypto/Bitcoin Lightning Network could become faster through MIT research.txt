Bitcoin Lightning Network could become faster through MIT researchA group of researchers from three prestigious U.S. universities, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Illinois, have presented the Spider routing solution. This solution will enable payment channel networks (PCN) such as Bitcoin's Lightning Network and Ethereum's Raiden to a better performance, improving scalability and thus expand the potential use of cryptocurrencies.The research concludes that cryptocurrencies cannot extend their usage because they suffer from poor scalability. This prevents them from becoming viable alternatives to traditional payment systems such as VISA. In comparison, the Bitcoin network is currently capable of processing 7 transactions per second (TPS), the Ethereum network 15 TPS and the VISA network an impressive 1,700 TPS.Research indicates that the problem behind the low scalability is the underlying consensus protocol:
