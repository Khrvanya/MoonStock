However, the chart shows that the momentum is currently bullish. If BTC can conquer the 200-day SMA, a rally could follow. Furthermore the Lucid Stop and Reversal Indicator shows an extremely bullish signal. This indicator last showed a buy signal in March 2019, which was followed by a rally in which BTC rose to over USD 10,000.Experienced Bitcoin trader Josh Rager is also bullish for Bitcoin and describes that BTC could reach a new all-time high if BTC closes above the USD 10,100 mark. However, he points out in further tweets that he believes Bitcoin will have to continue to fight hard after the summer and the halving to achieve its long-term goal.$BTC UptrendFixed range Volume Profile shows the importance of Point of Control (POC) for a major range to act as support2018 POC held as support at $6,400sIMO, we should see the 2019 POC act as support at $10,100= Price should stay above $10,100 on its way to new ATH pic.twitter.com/VkpUYqTYrO-- Josh Rager  (@Josh_Rager) January 17, 2020Ethereum Classic has risen by more than 170% in the last 30 days to a current price of USD 9.92. As CNF reported, ETC has activated the hard fork Agharta at block level 9,573,000. The update had the same goal as the previous Atlantis update, which was implemented in September 2019 to increase the interoperability of Ethereum Classic with Ethereum.Agharta has integrated the opcodes of the Constantinople and St. Petersburg upgrades into the Mainnet of Ethereum Classic. Another reason could also be in the ETC futures recently introduced by Binance with a 75x leverage. In addition, the provider SafePal Wallet now supports ETC, thus promoting the adaptation.Chainlink, together with Cosmos (+15.61%), is also one of the big winners and was able to increase by 15.69% to a price of USD 2.79 in the last 24 hours. Chainlink entered into a cooperation agreement with Conflux a few days ago to increase security in Smart Contracts. The cooperation enables a secure connection between Smart Contracts in the Conflux blockchain with information, web APIs and traditional off-chain payment systems.Chainlink is also playing a key role in the strong growth of the decentralised financial economy (DeFi). When DeFi reaches a billion or even trillion dollars, Chainlink and its LINK token could benefit greatly. Chainlink provides distributed oracles that provide off-chain connectivity for Ethereum Smart Contracts.Follow us on Facebook and Twitter and don't miss any hot news anymore!
