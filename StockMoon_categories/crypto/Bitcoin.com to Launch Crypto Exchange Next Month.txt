Traders on the platform will also be able to trade SLP-based tokens."We're on the cusp of something very exciting with SLP tokens. It's the beginning of a world where we can tokenize anything and, as people realize the potential this holds, they're going to start demanding a place to trade their tokens. That's why we'll be supporting SLP tokens on The Bitcoin.com Exchange," Ver added.Ver created Bitcoin Cash after a controversial split of Bitcoin's blockchain. A section of the Bitcoin community was in favor of increasing the block size of Bitcoin's blockchain to increase its efficiency, another opposed it, citing philosophical reasons. Since then, Ver became a proponent of Bitcoin Cash."Bitcoin.com has been around the space for many years now and we hope that the quality products we've already built--our wallet, our merchant app, and so on--help to reassure users and remind them that we're an established brand they can trust," he added.As crypto prices are rebounding since April, many prominent crypto-related businesses are diving into exchange business. Most recently, leading Bitcoin wallet platform Blockchain.com launched a fiat-to-crypto exchange, thus expanding its offerings.
