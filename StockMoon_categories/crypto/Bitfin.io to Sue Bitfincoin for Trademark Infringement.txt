Sorry for this inconvenience !-- Bitfincoin (@BitFincoin) March 12, 2018Bitfin.io, the Estonia-regulated exchange, is now concerned that the resemblance of its brand name with a fraud project might hamper its reputation within the crypto trading community."Bitfin Exchange is taking action against Bitfincoin in order to protect its name and interests," a spokesperson of the company to Finance Magnates."Bitfin, an EU licensed and regulated Crypto Currency Exchange is in no way connected to Bitfincoin, and will seek through legal proceedings to protect its trademarked name as well as distinguish itself from what appears to be unethical practices that tarnish and damage the cryptocurrency world in general."During the boom in the ICO market, shady crypto projects were very common, which primarily targeted inexperienced investors by making big promises.
