The close ties, along with an explosion in the amount of Tether dollars in circulation, caused a number of conspiracy theories to form, alleging that both companies were working together to "print" Tether dollars that had no actual asset-backing; a  years-long lack of a professional audit did not help either company's case in the matter.Things became even more serious when the New York Times published the findings of two researchers at the University of Texas suggesting that there could be some truth to the theories.However, the companies seem to be taking some efforts to dispel the rumors and clean up their images. Potter, who was serving as Bitfinex' chief strategy officer, resigned from the company in June.
