However, Bitfinex wants the supreme court to help it further and deny the NYAG's request to turn over documentation about the loan and line of credit that Tether provided to the controversial cryptocurrency exchange.The document further reads: "The OAG chose to target two virtual currency businesses that have nothing to do with New York investors -- the businesses do not allow New Yorkers on their platforms and do not advertise or otherwise do business here." The lawyers added that the New York State Attorney General's office has not identified, even in a general sense, any victim in New York or anywhere else."Making matters worse, OAG has proceeded under a statute, the Martin Act, governing "securities" and "commodities," neither of which describes the product bought by the supposed "victims" here, a "stablecoin" called tether," the filing adds.
