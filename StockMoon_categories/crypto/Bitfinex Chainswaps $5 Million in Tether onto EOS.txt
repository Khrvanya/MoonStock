The parent company of the project was recently fined with $24 million for selling unregistered digital tokens.Meanwhile, the EOS network is facing serious issues as users are facing periodic problems with network access in the past few weeks. A pseudonymous blockchain developer, Dexaran, also pointed out a vulnerability on the network which was exploited by the hackers to congest the network.
