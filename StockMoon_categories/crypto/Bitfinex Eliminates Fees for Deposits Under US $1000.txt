In other words, the fees were put in place in order to keep malevolent users from jamming up the exchange with numerous, minuscule deposits.According to the announcement, a high number of small deposits "created an excess of tiny wallet inputs that required wallet input consolidation maintenance." The fee reportedly "served to keep withdrawals flowing smoothly for all our customers."However, Ardoino explained that Bitfinex had taken other measures to prevent spam deposits on the exchange: "As we have developed capabilities to deter and thwart deposit-related spam attacks, the small deposit fee is no longer required," he said.The announcement came less than a week after Bitfinex began a partnership with Chainalysis, a New York-based provider of compliance software for real-time monitoring of cryptocurrency transactions.At the time, Peter Warrack, Chief Compliance Officer at Bitfinex, said that "the solution does not share information identifying users, which is kept strictly in-house."
