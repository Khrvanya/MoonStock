In addition, a sizable number of banks are not allowing their customers to use their credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies due to their volatile nature. However, an increasing number of digital asset platforms moved from being crypto-only to offer fiat currency options to customers.One of the prominent players in this space is Israeli-based payments provider Simplex, which allows users to swap between a range of over 1,200 crypto assets. Simplex charges 3.5 percent of a transaction, with a $10 minimum purchase amount. The company also applies various restrictions, including a $20,000 maximum for daily transactions when using a credit or debit card, as well as a $50,000 maximum monthly limit.Specially issued crypto cards are also another option that is quite popular in the crypto space, allowing the purchase of debit cards which can then be topped up with cryptocurrencies and spent at thousands of credit card-accepting merchants worldwide.
