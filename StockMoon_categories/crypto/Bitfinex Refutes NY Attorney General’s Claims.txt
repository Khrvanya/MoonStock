Although those foreign entities may have shareholders or personnel who reside in, or otherwise have contact with, the United States or New York, Bitfinex's and Tether's customers are the foreign entities themselves ... Bitfinex and Tether do not transact with any New York ECPs," the filing stated.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>The firms' attorney also mentioned a few ECPs, which include former Fortress partner Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital, an entity with an address in the New York.According to the company, Bitfinex followed the state's law and terminated its services there in January 2017, followed by a nationwide ban in August for all US-registered entities and retail customers.The filings also argued that although the NYAG's evidence showed that the crypto trading company was serving New York-based clients, it could not establish that any of the investors were harmed by the trading activity."After broad jurisdictional discovery, OAG has not shown that any aspect of the Crypto Capital relationship or the loan transaction -- the basis for the SS 354 Order -- touched on New York in any way. OAG has failed to identify a single New York customer who was misled or even considered representations about tether's backing, nor any New Yorker harmed," the filing noted.An additional filing was also submitted by the company's attorney, appealing to the court to dismiss the case alleging that the NYAG's office did not serve mandatory papers to Bitfinex and Tether.
