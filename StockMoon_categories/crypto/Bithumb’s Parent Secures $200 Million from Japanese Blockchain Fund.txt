That opened a backdoor for the Singapore-based holding company to publically list itself on the US market without facing the strict path of an initial public offering (IPO).Prior to this funding, Bithumb was already eying to expand its international presence and launched an over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk in February for institutional clients. Last year, the South Korean exchange opened an office in London and marked its presence in the middle east by opening a branch in the UAE.However, the exchange also faced a few setbacks as earlier this month; it reported an attack on the platform which was estimated to have involved around $19 million. This raised many questions on the exchange's security as only a few months ago, $30 million worth of cryptocurrencies were stolen from the exchange.The exchange recently addressed the security lapses and publicized the results of a third-party audit which assured the security of its clients' funds.
