Blackmoon and Rivver to Introduce a Crypto-Backed ETxBlackmoon, a blockchain-based fintech company, has partnered with Rivver to create a branded exchange-traded index (ETx) for digital assets."Knowing that one can liquidate his or her investment without an impact to price, is a key risk-metric to any and all investment decisions," the companies write in the press release announcing their partnership. "An STO that supports a thriving and liquid market, immediately increases its perceived value, even if its product, bottom-line or management is not as high a quality as its competitors. The liquidity of the marketplace defines the risk for an investor and the success of the issuer. Without the ease of execution and liquidity, any STO will have limited success, if any at all."Discover iFX EXPO, Your Gateway to Asian Markets!The Blackmoon-issued ETx will "incentivise traders and speculators to take the risk in the market, by offering them a fungible financial product to arbitrage for profit - further adding bids and offers to an STO that would otherwise not exist - effectively creating a balanced and stable price."Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>"We are very excited to be collaborating with Blackmoon," David Benizri, CEO of Rivver, said.
