One interesting thing to note about registering for the exchange is that users can sign up with merely an email address and basic personal information to make the process much quicker. Still, to be fully verified, users are required to provide a government-issued ID to obtain approval and increase trading limits.The PIT will compete with a slew of trading platforms but its parent, which launched eight years ago, claims to offer top-notch trading in many areas.Peter Smith, co-founder and CEO of Blockchain, explains: "The current crypto exchange market is outdated, broken, and skewed against users. We got tired of waiting for a new entrant to deliver the performance today's traders demand. We decided to take matters into our own hands, and built an exchange that puts users first, including the 40M wallets on our platform.""We're incredibly lucky to have assembled a world class team who have been heads-down building The PIT for the past year. The 'PIT Crew' as we call them, has an unmatched level of technical skills and the domain expertise required to develop a product of this caliber," added Smith.
