Only qualified entities with at least $100 million worth in assets owned or invested are allowed to purchase the shares of the ETF.However, the crypto-focused instrument failed to attract the attention of institutional investors as in around three weeks of the launch of the product, only one basket of the 4 Bitcoins worth around $41,000 were traded.Although the company did not clarify any reason behind the withdrawal of the application, it also withdrew its application in January after the prolonged shutdown of the United States government which then increased the chances of rejection of Bitcoin ETF.Meanwhile, another application of similar crypto-backed ETF by Bitwise and NYSE Arca is pending with the regulator for approval. The crypto company recently updated its application naming BNY Mellon as its transfer agent and administrator for the proposed ETF.
