When confronted by them, he said that he had transferred Bitcoin and Litecoin to his accounts for security purposes.When, eventually, his deeds were uncovered, Kim was apologetic.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>"I can't believe I did not stop myself when I had the money to give back, and I will live with that for the rest of my life," he said in an email sent to Consolidated Trading's management team.Though he was sorry for having taken the money, Kim then attempted to pay it back by lying to a bunch of other people. Having been fired from Consolidated Trading, he contacted a number of former clients and told them he had quit to set up a cryptocurrency trading firm.Five of those clients gave him just over $500,000 to trade with. Sadly for Kim, cryptocurrency trading is a dangerous game and he lost - very quickly - all of the money that they had given him.As a result, he will have to pay back all of the money his 'clients' gave him, as well as around $600,000 to Consolidated Trading. The CFTC has also placed a permanent trading and registration ban on Kim.On top of this, Kim will be going to prison for 15 months following a criminal trial in the state of Illinois.So you kids out there, if you don't want to throw your life away like Kim, don't steal cryptocurrency and, if you do, don't then steal more cryptocurrency to try and pay off the people who you stole cryptocurrency from in the first place.
