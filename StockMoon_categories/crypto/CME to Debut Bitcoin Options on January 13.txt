The BTC options will be priced off of the CME Bitcoin Reference Rate, an index that references pricing data from several cryptocurrency exchanges, currently made up of Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit, Kraken, and Gemini. They'll settle into the CME Bitcoin futures contract, which trades under the ticker BTC and equals five Bitcoins.The CME touts the benefits of options as the potential to save on margins, through margin offsets.The CME also provided updated metrics about its Bitcoin futures, which averaged 6,500+ contracts per day in 2019 (equal to around 32,500 Bitcoin), apparently representing institutional interest. Year-to-date volumes have almost doubled since 2018 as the exchange has signed 3,500+ individual accounts and had 22 successful expiration settlements since then."Since the launch of our Bitcoin futures nearly two years ago, clients have expressed a growing interest in options as another way to hedge and trade in these markets," added McCourt.
