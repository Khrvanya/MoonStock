Before the US, the Hangzhou-based company also made multiple attempts to publicly list its stocks on both China and Hong Kong stock exchanges.Canaan's application for an IPO lapsed last November at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx). Earlier this year, reports surfaced that the miner maker might attempt to list its stocks on the Shanghai Stock Exchange under the newly created Science and Technology (Sci-Tech) Innovation Board.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Meanwhile, Canaan's competitor and leading ASIC-based hardware manufacturer, Bitmain, is also reportedly attempting to enter the United States with an IPO proposal after failing in Hong Kong.BREAKINGAccording to public record, Jihan Wu took over Micree Zhan as the legal representative of Bitmain in ChinaUnder China law, this means he serves as the legal embodiment of the company, which is a crucial roleBitmain obviously can't sit still while Canaan filed IPO-- Dovey Yi De Fu Ren  Wan   (@DoveyWan) October 29, 2019
