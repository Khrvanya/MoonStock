In addition, the Cardano Foundation will also leverage COTI's universal payment solution (UPI) to power the ADA payment gateway offering.With UPI, the foundation aims to bring a comprehensive payment solution to combine all existing support systems of traditional payment processors with the added value of digital assets. It will also be used to extend the utility use case for the token - both inside and outside of the Cardano ecosystem.Earlier this year, in an interview with Finance Magnates, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson revealed the ambition of the company to be a payments giant and also believe that it can beat Facebook's proposed cryptocurrency in emerging markets."We have a lot to the mutual trust and support between the Cardano ecosystem partners and COTI. This joint effort is one of the first steps we are taking in delivering a truly universal payment solution and expanding the COTI tech stack beyond our own ecosystem. The ways people exchange value is changing for the better, and the future is looking more promising for payments," Bar-Geffen added.
