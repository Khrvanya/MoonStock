ScarnTrust will provide security solutions for supply chain traceability. On the other hand, Berkman Klein Center, belonging to Harvad University, will support Cardano's ecosystem by carrying out research on decentralized governance.In addition, another of Cardano's recent prominent partnerships, Gen Two AG, has announced the intention to launch a new financial product to the market using its blockchain. DeFi systems are booming, and 2020 could be the year of consolidation for this type of financial service.Cardano has also entered into a partnership with the government entities of Uzbekistan, with the help of Emurgo, both entities will help in the development of Security and Exchange Tokens. Also, they will offer consultancy services to the government, for the development of new projects using blockchain technology.The price of ADA, with respect to the USDT pair, is particularly bullish, after having successfully completed the cup-to-handled pattern, which has implied a change in the price trend.ADA/USDT 4 HOURSSource: Tradingview.comADA completed its turnaround by breaking the neck of the handle-cup formation at $0.038 with a large trading volume.The price reached $0.047 and seems to be stabilizing in the range of $0.041-$0.047.We see a significant increase in trading volume at that level, as shown by the volume profile, so we may be seeing a re-accumulation before the uptrend continues.At $0.041 the 100-period Exponential Moving Average is being set, and there was a strong rebound with a long wick at the candle closure, so we consider that price to be a pretty solid support to break out.In short, the trend is upward, lateralizing within the mentioned range.The $0.047 is the key resistance to continue with the bullish rally, however, a break of the support at $0.041, could imply a reversal of the trend.Last Updated on 26 January, 2020
