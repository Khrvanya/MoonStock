Circle has developed its own set of guidelines for listing cryptocurrencies, which include criteria based on a coin's technology, team, business model, and market dynamics.In addition to the new assets, Circle is also announcing the addition of its 'Explore' feature, which "will give contextual, relevant information on the various aspects of crypto."Circle is hoping that the 'Explore' feature will invite new groups of investors into the cryptocurrency markets, including women. "A lot of the apps that exist on the market are geared toward folks that understand the market already and unfortunately, that tends to be men," said Divya Agarwalla, Circle's head of product, to TechCrunch.Indeed, many of the communities that fostered cryptocurrency in its earlier days were unwelcoming to women; global finance and technology fields are still largely dominated by men.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>The inspiration for the feature reportedly came from the results of a study that revealed a significant lack of diversity among cryptocurrency users and investors.SURVEY: Millennial women underrepresented in #crypto investing opportunity #cryptocurrency https://t.co/hEcGhXjJHy-- Circle Invest (@circleinvest) September 17, 2018It seems that Circle's latest move further into the crypto space is an attempt to make its investment app more appealing than similar platforms, like Coinbase.Like Circle, Coinbase's app interface is a simple, user-friendly platform with a small number of intensely-vetted investment options. Also like Circle, Coinbase has published its own set of intensive criteria for choosing which coins it should be listing.Circle does not seem to be intimidated by its competitor-rather, the company is making bold moves into what it believes is a market with high potential for growth. Circle co-founder Jeremy Allaire said earlier this year that he believes that "all fiat currency will be crypto.""It seems inevitable at this point," he said.
