Circle to Phase Out Support for its Social Payment AppGoldman Sachs-backed cryptocurrency firm Circle is gearing up to discontinue support for its social payment app, dubbed 'Circle Pay,' which has been available in 29 countries including the US, UK, and some EU countries.The decision represents a notable shift in product direction for Circle which recently laid off roughly 30 people, or about 10 percent of its staff, citing regulatory uncertainties.Discover the Barcelona Trading Conference - A Top Tier Crypto Trading EventThe changes, which are beginning to roll out now, will see the Circle Pay service phasing out support for making payments and charging users effective July 8. Over time, users will see even less functionality, and eventually, the company will fully deprecate all support for Circle Pay on September 30.The news was reported in a blog post by the startup, which stated that it believes the future of finance will be built on open blockchain technology."All Circle Pay customers should cash out their funds today. Customers who currently hold Bitcoin in Circle Pay are also encouraged to send BTC funds to another wallet such as a Poloniex account," it explains.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>The move comes as Circle has expanded into a wide range of crypto-related business, including Circle Invest, which enables purchases of 11 different coins and Circle Trade, an OTC marketplace that handles turnover of more than $2 billion each month.Circle also owns crypto exchange Poloniex, which trades over 100 cryptocurrencies, and most recently announced the acquisition of SeedInvest, an alternative trading system licensed under FINRA.
