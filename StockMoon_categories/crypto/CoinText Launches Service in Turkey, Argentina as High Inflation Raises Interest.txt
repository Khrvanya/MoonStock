The central banks in both nations tried to keep inflation in check through rate hikes, but to no avail. The Argentine peso, for example, lost half of its value this year against the US dollar, while the lira shed 40 percent.CoinText's wallet runs with basic and simple commands like Balance, Deposit, Send, and Withdraw. The wallet doesn't store any data about transactions in the system as the server only processes operations through an algorithm which settles transactions directly on-chain.The service is designed to enable customers to send, receive and store money via a basic mobile phone, which caters to billions of underbanked people around the world.  With the latest additions, the service is now available in 27 countries.Commenting on the news, CoinText founder and CTO Vin Armani, said: "Bitcoin is better money. Many Turks and Argentinians already understand this due to high inflation. We are excited to provide tools to help them use cryptocurrency. Before CoinText, you had to download a software wallet or join an exchange to get your first cryptocurrency. And to onboard your friends, you had to convince them to do the same process. Now you can just text money to their phone."
