The new feature will be part of the in-app news and asset information pages and can be opted into or out of. Eventually, "we'll expand price alerts to include assets not yet tradable on Coinbase," the blog post said.There's a good chance that the notifications will contribute to an increase in the amount of time that each user spends on the application-there is no longer a need to draw trading information from different sources.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Indeed, "customers asked for real-time price alerts natively in the Coinbase app to address the inconvenience of having to check multiple sources for crypto market information," a Coinbase representative explained to crypto news source CoinDesk."Real-time price alerts available natively in the Coinbase app streamlines access to information that helps customers make more informed investment decisions."A study by marketing research firm Localytics revealed that 52 percent of smartphone users enable push messaging on their mobile devices. Of that 52 percent, at least 15 percent of users completed the action that the push notification prompted them to do.Coinbase' notifications will only contain a short piece of information on price data-no prompts telling them to buy or sell. In fact, the blog post announcing the new feature said that "price alerts are provided for informational purposes only, and do not constitute a recommendation by Coinbase to buy, sell or hold any asset."However, the notifications could cause users to execute trades on the app more frequently-which could mean a sizeable increase in trading fee revenues for the company.Previous to the announcement of the push notification feature, Coinbase created a feature called "watchlist," which allowed users to customize their in-app "dashboards": "click the star icon on any asset pages to indicate you're interested in those cryptocurrencies, and your dashboard will feature key information about those assets on a new Following tab."
