It has also acquired Venovate Marketplace Inc. and Digital Wealth LLC. The acquired businesses offer Coinbase a broker-dealer license (B-D), an alternative trading system license (ATS), and a registered investment advisor (RIA) license.The move comes as the US Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking legitimate platforms serving as trading venues for digital assets. This topic has received much attention since the SEC made clear that any digital token with an income stream is a security, and furthermore that any entity wants to become an ATS needs to register with the SEC as a broker-dealer and become a member of a self-regulating organization, such as the FINRA.
