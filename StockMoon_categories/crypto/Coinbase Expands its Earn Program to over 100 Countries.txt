But regardless of the actual price, the acquisition gave Coinbase access to a large audience that used the platform as a way to earn cryptocurrencies for performing simple tasks.Founded in 2013, Earn originally was developing chips and hardware for cryptocurrency mining. The startup had rebranded in 2017 from 21.co with the launch of its eponymous paid messaging platform, which allows senders to pay users in cryptocurrency to reply to emails and complete tasks.It has since pivoted to crypto-based messaging technology, which some believe the ultimate goal was to decentralize its network allowing each person to join the project and earn digital currencies for their micro-tasks.
