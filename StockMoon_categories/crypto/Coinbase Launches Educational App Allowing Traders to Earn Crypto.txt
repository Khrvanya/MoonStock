Learners have to complete some activity associated with the lessons like watching videos and participating in quizzes to get the reward.In the initial phase, Coinbase will only give the rewards in ZRX token, the native token of the Ox platform. Ox is funding the entire project, and the incentive funds will come from the firm's external development pool.Coinbase, however, ensured that it is going to add more cryptocurrencies to incentivize the learners in the future. "Over time, we plan to add more educational content as well as the ability to earn other cryptocurrencies," stated Coinbase.Although the program is invite-only for now, the educational content is available to anyone in the world. Moreover, enthusiasts can sign up to a waitlist to join the incentivized program at a later stage.The announcement also explained the technological complexities which created a barrier for the general population to understand cryptocurrencies. "Mining cryptocurrency typically requires technical knowledge and high upfront costs, while buying cryptocurrency can require disposable income to exchange for cryptocurrencies," the exchange stated.Moreover, to promote cryptocurrencies, the exchange has launched a 12-day program in the holiday season and is announcing new features and support for cryptocurrencies daily.
