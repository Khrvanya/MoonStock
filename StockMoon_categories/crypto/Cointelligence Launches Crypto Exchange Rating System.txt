It will be possible to check if an exchange is safe and reliable with the certainty that only actual/factual improvement of the exchange itself can change the rating," Cointelligence noted.This is not the first rating system of Cointelligence as the firm already provides a similar service for ICOs and security token offerings (STOs).Commenting on this development, On Yavin, the firm's founder and CEO, said: "We looked around the industry and we didn't see anyone really doing this. Given the number of hacks and exit scams the exchange industry has seen, we felt this was an important tool to protect the community."
