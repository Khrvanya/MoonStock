Though Wright can appeal against the judgment in a higher court, he is not entitled to a jury trial or to oppose the hearing.The estate of Wright's late business partner, David Kleiman, filed a lawsuit in February 2018 over claims that Wright misappropriated a $10 billion fortune. The allegations concern the ownership of between 550,000 and 1.1 million bitcoins, which the two business partners mined together, as well as the intellectual property rights of various blockchain technologies.Earlier in May, the same court ordered Wright to disclose the public Bitcoin addresses owned by him as of December 31, 2013.Wright is one of the most controversial figures in the crypto space. His claims of being the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto were squashed by many prominent figures in the industry.Last month, a UK court dismissed defamation changes brought by him against Roger Ver due to jurisdictional issues. He also filed another similar lawsuit against podcaster Peter McCormick, which is still ongoing.
