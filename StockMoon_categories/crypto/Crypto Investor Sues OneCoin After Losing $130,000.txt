The platform pays its affiliate members commissions for introducing others to purchase its cryptocurrency and contribute to a related ICO.The pyramid worked throughout Europe and Asia for more than two years and attracted millions of dollars before the regulators of different countries began to worry about the legitimacy of this business.In 2017, the government of Kazakhstan clamped down on the company, labeling it a scam that promoted a cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme, given its structure which promises 10x ROI in a few months - which is a clear sign of a pyramid scam.A few months later, Ignatova was arrested in India along with another 30 individuals, charged with running a scam involving thousands of investors. Indian police noted that OneCoin money was stored in 35 different bank accounts, and the majority of it was transferred to an unknown location shortly after the arrests were made.According to the official court document, the FBI has also arrested Mark Scott, a former partner with the international law firm Locke Lord, who has been accused of laundering approximately $400 million, which investigators claim is the proceeds of OneCoin scheme.Investigators say that Scott laundered funds through hedge funds in the Cayman Islands and sent the majority of these funds back to the unnamed founders of the scheme.
