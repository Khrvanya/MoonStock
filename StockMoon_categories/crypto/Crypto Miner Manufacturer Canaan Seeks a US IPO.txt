It designs and manufactures high-performance ASIC-based miners for Bitcoin mining and is well know for the Avalon series of bitcoin mining machines.According to an unaudited income report released in January 2018, Canaan made a profit of $64 million (410 million yuan) for 2017 alone - a 600 percent increase from its previous year's figures.Moreover, before Hong Kong, the Beijing-based hardware manufacturer also tried to list itself on multiple exchanges in China, but all of its applications were rejected by the exchanges.The Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) has become very cautious about listings of crypto mining firms amid the crashing Bitcoin prices. Reports showed that the exchange is reluctant to list Bitmain's IPO and thinks that its "premature for any cryptocurrency trading platform - or business associated with the industry - to raise funds through an IPO in Hong Kong before the proper regulatory framework is in place."Despite the hostility of the exchange, another crypto miner-manufacturer - Ebang Communications - filed for an IPO the second time on HKEX as its first application to the same was lapsed.
