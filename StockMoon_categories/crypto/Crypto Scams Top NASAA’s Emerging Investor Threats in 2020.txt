No one can guarantee an investment return," said Christopher Gerold, NASAA president and chief of the New Jersey Bureau of Securities.The regulator has put the phenomenon of the crypto craze at the top of their investment scams list, highlighting that cryptocurrencies and related financial products may be nothing more than "public facing fronts for Ponzi schemes and other frauds." As such, it advises investors to screen themselves from crypto promotions that fail to offer clear disclosures of their risks and costs.

As such, con artists can easily lure people and promote fraudulent investment products using a highly targeted pitch.During NASAA's 2018 fiscal year, the agency's enforcement actions secured more than $1 billion in restitution, disgorgement, and penalties. Out of this figure, more than $558 million returned to investors million, while $490 million in fines were handed over to the regulators.The NASAA revealed that more than 130 new cryptocurrency-related cases are being actively investigated, with 35 enforcement actions already taken since the beginning of 2019.These investigations are part of the association's ongoing coordinated regulatory initiative called Operation Cryptosweep, which was launched in 2018. At that time, more than 40 state and provincial securities regulators in the United States and Canada launched their coordinated enforcement sweep of the ICO market.The NASAA noted that while some of the investigations involve suspected securities fraud, the regulators are also finding many other violations, including failure to register a product before it was offered to investors.NASAA also organized a task force to launch investigations into ICOs and cryptocurrency-related investment products. The task force found more than 30,000 crypto-related domain name registrations, the vast majority of which appeared in 2017 and 2018.
