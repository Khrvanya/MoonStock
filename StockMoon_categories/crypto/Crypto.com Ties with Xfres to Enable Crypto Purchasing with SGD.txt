This combined pilot to adopt XSGD for MCO Card top-up and for Crypto.com spend adds to our strong foundation for the initiative, as StraitsX aims to be the common ledger for digital assets and payments- enabling transparency for payments," Tianwei Liu, co-founder and CEO of Xfers, added.Meanwhile, the crypto exchange plans to become a major player in the region. In an attempt to build public trust, the platform obtained a $100 million insurance policy earlier this year.
