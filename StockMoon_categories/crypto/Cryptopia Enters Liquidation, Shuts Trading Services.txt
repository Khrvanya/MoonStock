While this process and investigations take place, trading on the exchange is suspended."The troubled exchange also highlighted that the process is complex and could take "months rather than weeks" to complete.Commenting on the process, Ruscoe said: "We realize Cryptopia's customers will want to have this matter resolved as soon as possible. We will conduct a thorough investigation, working with several different stakeholders including management and shareholders, to find the solution that is in the best interests of customers and stakeholders."The announcement created a stir in the crypto community as many are now concerned for their stored funds on the exchange. The exchange is also facing backlash for little to no information disclosed about the attack and was compared to the recent transparent approach of Binance in dealing with the $40 million worth BTC theft. It's been 4 months and @Cryptopia_NZ fails to answer to their users. This shows that the customers are definitely not the PRIORITY (Contrary to their Statement) . A really bad example for the crypto space.#crypto #altcoins #Bitcoin #exchanges pic.twitter.com/z2pbyevBIu-- Hegion (@HegionOfficial) May 13, 2019
