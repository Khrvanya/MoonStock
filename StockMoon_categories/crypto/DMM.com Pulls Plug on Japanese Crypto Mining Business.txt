Speaking to The Nikkei on Monday, the founder of DMM.com's mining business, Keishi Kameyama said that going forward: "he will work hard on '[the] exchange [business] and blockchains.'"Discover iFX EXPO, Your Gateway to Asian Markets!The exchange business he is referring to is DMM Bitcoin, a subsidiary of the group, which is one of the 16 regulated cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan. Before Kameyama spoke to The Nikkei, on December 30, 2018, Toyo Keizai quoted the company as saying "Deteriorating profitability is the main cause" for the firm closing down its business.

DMM.com's departure from the crypto mining business follows on the heels of Japanese IT giant GMO Internet announcing that it will be pulling the plug on its mining operations. As Finance Magnates reported, last week the company said in a regulatory filing that, as the price of cryptocurrencies continues to take a downturn, the profitability of its cryptocurrency-focused mining chips mirrors the same trend.
