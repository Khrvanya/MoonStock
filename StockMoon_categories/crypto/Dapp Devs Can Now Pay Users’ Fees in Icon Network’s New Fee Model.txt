Dapp Devs Can Now Pay Users’ Fees in Icon Network’s New Fee ModelSouth Korean blockchain project Icon has announced the launch of 'Fee 2.0', a new transaction fee system that allows users to access Icon's dapp (decentralized application) services without paying transaction fees. The announcement came in an official statement from the company shared with Finance Magnates on July 15.Previous to the launch of Fee 2.0, Icon dapp users were required to pay fees in cryptocurrency from the moment they began using a dapp's services. On a practical level, this meant that only users with a certain amount of cryptocurrency were able to access a dapp built on the Icon network, to begin with.Discover the Barcelona Trading Conference - A Top Tier Crypto Trading EventWe are pleased to announce that MainNet update is completed today to support Fee 2.0 system.

Indeed, Fee 2.0's "Fee Sharing" feature makes it possible for dapp operators to pay the transaction fees on behalf of the dapp users.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>If dapp operators may not have enough money to foot the bill for their users right away, Icon has also launched a "Virtual Step" program in which dapp operators pay their dues with funds raised through the process of staking ICX: dapp operators must deposit ICX tokens into their dapps' smart contracts for a certain period of time in order to earn their Virtual Steps."Virtual Step is generated every month in proportion with the quantity of ICX deposited and the duration of the deposit," the announcement explains.While it's unclear whether or not Fee 2.0 will unlock greater usage of Icon's dapp network, there growing evidence that dapps are becoming more popular across the industry.Most recently, this was evidenced by two events: Waves' entry into the dapp sphere, and Samsung's creation of a software development kit for dapps last week."Samsung Blockchain SDK is available to communicate with external blockchain node providing payment solution," a Samsung official said to Developer-Tech.com.
