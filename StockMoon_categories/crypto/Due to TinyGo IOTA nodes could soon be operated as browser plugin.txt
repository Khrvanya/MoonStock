Due to TinyGo IOTA nodes could soon be operated as browser pluginAs the TinyGo team announced the day before yesterday, the Go compiler has become an official Google-sponsored project. The funding from Google, according to an IOTA developer by the Twitter name HusQy, could soon enable the execution of IOTA nodes as a browser plugin using WebAssembly (WASM) or by creating a new compiler based on LLVM.TinyGo is a Go compiler designed for small places like microcontrollers, WebAssembly (WASM) and command line tools. It aims to bring the Go programming language to microcontrollers and modern web browsers by creating a new compiler based on LLVM. TinyGo can also be used to generate WebAssembly (WASM) code, which is very compact.TinyGo uses libraries used by the Go tools besides LLVM to provide an alternative way to compile programs written in the Go programming language. Unlike Emgo, however, TinyGo retains the Go storage model and internally uses LLVM (instead of outputting C) to provide smaller and more efficient code.As HusQy noted, Google's promotion could soon enable IOTA nodes to run on a wide variety of microcontrollers or as "on-demand nodes" in the form of a browser plugin. The latter, HusQy said, could be realized with the help of WebAssembly (WASM).TinyGo is now officially funded by google, which means that we might soon be able to run IOTA nodes on several different micro controllers or as an "on-demand-node" in form of a browser plugin (using WASM).https://t.co/55NHKg0fMA#golang-- HusQy (@hus_qy) February 3, 2020The IOTA ledger technology has an official Go Client library that enables the creation, reading and signing of transactions as well as the generation of addresses. The library is also used in the GoShimmer prototype for Coordicide. By using TinyGo, IOTA nodes could be run on many microcontroller boards. Currently TinyGo supports 27 different boards, including the Arduino Nano33 IoT, Adafruit Circuit Playground Express, BBC micro:bit.While it is not clear whether the HusQy idea will be implemented, the implementation could be another step towards IOTA vision of becoming the standard for machine economics. As CNF reported, GoShimmer V 0.1.0, the Alphanet for a coordinator-free IOTA, was launched yesterday, earlier than expected. The main features of the first version of GoShimmer are Autopeering, Gossip, Rate Control and an API for the Tangle.In order to achieve a status ahead of Coordicide in that IOTA technology is ready for industrial and enterprise use, the IOTA Foundation also announced Chrysalis yesterday. However, with the potential legal dispute between David Sonstebo and Sergey Ivancheglo, a sword of Damocles still hangs over IOTA. Even though Dominik Schiener stated that IOTA Foundation will not be involved in the potential lawsuit, he assured David Sonstebo the support of the IOTA Foundation.We remain focused on realizing the future of IOTA through necessary technical decisions that significantly improve the protocol. While the IOTA Foundation has no legal participation in recent personal threats and dispute, we will obviously give all the necessary support to David.-- Dominik Schiener (@DomSchiener) February 3, 2020Follow us on Facebook and Twitter and don't miss any hot news anymore!
