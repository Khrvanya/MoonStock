As these digital currencies are pegged to physical assets, they are less volatile, and the ECB is monitoring the development of these assets.Mentioning the decentralized nature of the digital currencies, the bank noted: "The absence of any specific institution (such as a central bank or monetary authority) protecting the value of crypto-assets hinders their use as a form of money, since their volatility: a) prevents their use as a store of value; b) discourages their use as a means of payment; and c) makes it difficult to use them as a unit of account."Earlier this year, Ardo Hansson, governor of the Central Bank of Estonia and an ECB policymaker, attacked cryptocurrencies, calling them a "complete load of nonsense." A similar sentiment was echoed by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank who slammed Bitcoin for not being a currency.Stablecoins, on the other hand, are grabbing the attention of the institutions as the governor Bank of France recently revealed that the bank is observing the developments of such coins with "great interest."
