"This reelection is a vote of confidence in our solutions, technology and most importantly in our team."Electroneum is betting heavily on the developing markets where there is low penetration of financial technology and is developing a digital ecosystem for day-to-day spending with cryptocurrencies.The London-headquartered company also provides a mobile-based crypto mining experience for its native ETN tokens. However, the mining is only a simulation to attract enthusiasts towards the industry as a real mobile-based mining rig would drain the battery in minutes.Last month at the Mobile World Congress, Electroneum launched an $80 blockchain-enabled smartphone capable of crypto mining - of course, the simulated version of it. The phone attracted a lot of attention with its cheap price tag as its other market competitions including FINNEY and HTC Exodus are priced around $1000.
