Ethereum 2.0 update on its progress and its featuresThe Ethereum update due to take place in January 2020 continues to cause news. After CNF published an article pointing out the criticisms of the move from Ethereum to Ethereum 2.0, the team behind the project updates on its progress.The announcement was made by Danny Ryan through Ethereum's Blog. In his Twitter account, Ryan also highlighted some of the points the team is concentrating on:Quiet Client development focused on eth1 -> eth2 infrastructure, general hardening for production, and optimization.Also, update the transition from state to v0.9.0.From this and the blog post, it is reasonable to think that the Ethereum 2.0 team places special emphasis on the development of infrastructure and communications between blockchains. This feature, which would allow Ethereum users and developers to communicate with other blockchains (crosslinks), would be one of the most innovative.Other specifications that the update will have includes increasing the sharps block that make up the Ethereum blockchain from 16kB to 128kB, which would lead to a significant reduction in the number of sharps from 1024 to 64. For customer management, the upgrade would plan to implement a tool to monitor networking and increase customer cross communication.One of the members who has participated most in the debate about the positive and negative points of the Etherum update is its creator, Vitalik Buterin. He has conducted several surveys on Twitter to know more about the general opinion of users of ETH.One of the concerns expressed by users is their perception that the Ethereum blockchain would be moving towards centralization. On this, a member of the community raised with Buterin the possibility that Forks are no longer viable with DeFi. The creator of Ethereum replied:An important underlooked possible consequence of DeFi! https://t.co/2N3xPMWEAd-- Vitalik Non-giver of Ether (@VitalikButerin) October 31, 2019His tweet recognizes that this possibility is a problem. It remains to be seen how events will evolve and how the cryptocommunity will react to the Ethereum 2.0 update.Last Updated on 2 November, 2019
