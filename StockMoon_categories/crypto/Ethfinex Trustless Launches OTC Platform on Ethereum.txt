This market first removes the need for escrow, and opens up OTC to anyone through significantly lower fees at 0.02% (vs 2-5% on more traditional OTC desks)," the press release added.In addition, there is no need for submitting any know-your-customer (KYC) documents, meaning trades will be executed anonymously. This, however, barred traders based in the United States and other restricted jurisdictions from using the platform.This development came at a time when Bitfinex is struggling with its reputation in the market after serious allegations by New York Attorney General's office.The cryptocurrency exchange recently launched an initial exchange offering (IEO) platform along with Ethfinex."Extending the capabilities of Ethfinex Trustless to include an OTC service is an important step in fulfilling the potential of decentralization in the cryptocurrency market," Will Harborne, founder of Ethfinex Trustless, said. "It opens the doors to those previously prohibited by expensive OTC desks and provides security in blockchain enforced atomic deals. Customers no longer have to place trust in a third party, or take the risk of trades directly with the counterparty themselves."
