According to FINRA, he also entered into an agreement with a technology company that would provide the hardware needed to get the mining business started.If all of this sounds relatively innocent, that's because it is. Kim didn't actually do anything that was necessarily illegal.But, according to FINRA, he should have informed Merrill Lynch of the activities that he was engaging in. His failure to do so, the self-regulating body said, was what landed him with a fine."Kim failed to provide written notice to Merrill of the above-described activity," said FINRA. "By reason of the foregoing, Kim violated FINRA rules."As a result of his actions, Kim was also discharged from a role that he had held with banking giant Merrill Lynch in March of last year.
