Users will always fully maintain custody of their funds when using the EBO wallet," said Terrance Sullivan, founder of EBO, to Finance Magnates.The lack of know-your-customer (KYC) measures on the platform could also make the platform more accessible to individuals who lack documentation to sign onto other crypto trading platforms."Regulatory requirements are a huge obstacle that block billions of people around the world from even the most basic financial services," Sullivan told Finance Magnates. "We believe that the world needs open finance now more than ever."However, the company also said that despite the lack of KYC, "EBO works within the current regulatory framework," and as such, "does not allow users to exchange digital tokens that could be considered a security."Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>The wallet was "developed from a fork of the Trust Wallet," Sullivan explained to Finance Magnates.
