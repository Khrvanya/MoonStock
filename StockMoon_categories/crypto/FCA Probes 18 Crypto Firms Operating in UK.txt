Tokens are considered commodities in the UK, which are not the FCA's concern - but cryptocurrency derivatives are. The FCA has, like many other regulators, divided tokens into three groups for the purpose of classification - currency, security, and utility.However, with the growing investments risks in the volatile crypto market, the UK government, earlier this month, put forth its intention to equip the FCA with more power to crack down the suspicious looking blockchain businesses.According to the report, Christopher Woolard, the executive director of strategy and competition at the agency, thinks that the crypto assets posed 'potential harm' to consumers and are devaluing the UK's financial market integrity.However, the UK's established institutions are not entirely against crypto. Woolard further clarified that the FCA, HM Treasury, and the Bank of England are considering to take necessary steps in the coming months to mitigate the market threats and encourage the nascent industry for 'beneficial innovation.'In November, one of the executives at the FCA revealed the agencies intentions to put a ban on the sale of cryptocurrency contracts-for-difference (CFDs) to retail investors.
