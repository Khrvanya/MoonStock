FDD Warns US Against International “Crypto Rogues”A new report by the United States Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) entitled "Crypto Rogues - U.S. State Adversaries Seeking Blockchain Sanctions Resistance," details current and future risks associated with the use of cryptocurrencies by US adversaries. More specifically, the report focused on countries who are or may eventually be issuing their own digital currencies, including Venezuela, Chian, Iran, and Russia.The report also cautions against a scenario in which an adversarial country creates a digital currency wallet infrastructure that allows residents to hold and trade a cryptocurrency, as well as use it for transactions with local businesses.Discover the Barcelona Trading Conference - A Top Tier Crypto Trading EventThe cryptocurrency could be nationally issued, or could be an independent cryptocurrency that is simply adopted for widespread use within the country:"An independent cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin [BTC] gains wide adoption in commerce and becomes more relevant to the global financial system. Then, a U.S. adversary begins to build significant reserves in the cryptocurrency. The state thus uses its holdings to gain more influence in the global financial system," the report reads.The FDD warns that the issuance of a national digital currency by any of these nations may make sanctions much harder to enforce, particularly if the currency is tied to a major commodity, such as oil.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>While at first glance, the scenarios described in the report may appear to have an element of science fiction, the reality of the situation is not too far off.Indeed, the Venezuelan Petro - which is supposedly tied to oil reserves, although the status of the project is dubious - has been decried by international regulators as a thinly-veiled attempt to evade sanctions and access international debt markets.Iran's exploration of a national cryptocurrency reportedly came in partial response to the blocking of some of the country's banks from the international SWIFT financial messaging system.
