The supervision of UBS or Credit Suisse also does not take place in complete isolation."He also pointed out that the Swiss regulator would focus on minimizing money laundering with the crypto."New technologies can also bring benefits in the fight against money laundering, for example, if traceability of transactions becomes fully available. So there are risks and opportunities," Branson added.
