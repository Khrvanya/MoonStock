The schemes promised a return of $80,000 per month for investment as little as $100.Similar to classic pyramid schemes, the investors were also encouraged to recruit more participants in the investment scheme to receive lucrative rewards.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>The watchdog agency also alleged that Chandler, in addition to both MLM schemes, also promoted Jetcoin and assured investors of a "fixed rate of return" for their investments.The shady schemes alarmed the commission last year, which prompted it to obtain a court order in March 2018 to stop the marketing practices of the MLM scheme and froze the assets of the promoters.The settlement ordered Dluca to pay $453,932, while the penalty for Chandler was set at $31,000. Though Pinkston was also ordered to pay $461,035, the penalty will be suspended upon payment of $29,491, due to his inability to pay the full amount.In addition to the penalty, all four promoters are permanently prohibited from "operating, participating in, or assisting others in promoting or operating any multi-level marketing program, pyramid, Ponzi, or chain referral scheme."The commission approached the district court of the Southern District of Florida with the proposed order.Earlier this month, the securities market watchdog in the US settled with illegal crypto investment scheme of PlexCoin against the payment of $7 million in total by the promoters and the company.
