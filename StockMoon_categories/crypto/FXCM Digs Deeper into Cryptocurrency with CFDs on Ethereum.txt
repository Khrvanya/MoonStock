Cryptocurrencies have surged in popularity, with many seeing new trading opportunities. In particular, there has been huge demand from retail foreign exchange traders for crypto CFDs, particularly due to the ability to go both long and short. And while we may not have been the first to launch, we are looking to offer a competitive suite of cryptocurrencies."
