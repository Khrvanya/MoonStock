Fidelity May Add ETH Support as Institutional Battle Heats UpWhen Fidelity Digital Assets (FDAS) was launched in early 2019, offering custody services and tools for institutional traders and investors, the firm's services started and ended with the support of Bitcoin. However, FDAS president Tom Jessop told The Block's Frank Chaparro that all of that might soon change."On 'The Scoop Live' podcast, Frank Chaparro recently spoke to Fidelity Digital Assets' president, Tom Jessop, to talk about ... support for Ethereum, and the application of blockchain technology in the tokenization of traditional assets."https://t.co/h6vpnxL7D4Discover iFX EXPO Asia 2020 in Macao - The Largest Financial B2B Expo-- Frank Chaparro (@fintechfrank) December 14, 2019Indeed, the institutional cryptocurrency trading platform, which is operated by US-based financial services firm Fidelity, may roll out support for Ether next year, Jessop said. However, Jessop also said that support for ETH would only truly be considered if the company's clients show sufficient interest."We've done a lot of work on Ethereum. We intend to support it in the New Year," Jessop explained, adding that "we're very led by our clients."The Block's Celia Wan wrote that some have argued that the fact that FDAS only supports Bitcoin has "kept FDAS from truly competing with crypto-native firms like Coinbase and BitGo."Indeed, the addition of ETH support could bring FDAS into closer competition with services like Coinbase Pro and BitGo, which also offers institutional trading and custody services in multiple digital assets. However, Fidelity would have quite a bit of catching up to do in terms of the number of assets offered; for example, Coinbase Pro offers trading in Bitcoin Cash, Stellar Lumens, XRP, Dash, and other cryptocurrencies.Still, it could be argued that FDAS' proximity to institutional clients involved in Fidelity's other branches could offer FDAS an advantage when it comes to onboarding new investors and traders.FDAS isn't designed to serve retail investors-rather, the company primarily serves institutional clients: hedge funds, pensions, endowments, family offices, and other kinds of institutional investors.In October, Kathleen Murphy, who is the president of personal investing at Fidelity Investments, told CNBC that Fidelity generally does not offer cryptocurrencies on any of its retail trading platforms in order to protect retail clients."While we embrace crypto in terms of trying to understand it and be innovative and thoughtful... We're also very careful about where we offer those types of things, so they're not offered broadly on the retail platform," she said. "We want to be very careful about making sure that investors who really aren't institutional investors [...] don't make a mistake with cryptocurrency."In Jessop's recent interview, he also said that the lack of regulatory clarity, price volatility, and well-established track record had kept Fidelity Digital Assets away from exploring the support of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies so far.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>"How do I know that if I buy this thing, it's gonna be around tomorrow?" he asked. "Like, what indication of durability or longevity do I have based on the fact that the history of this asset is 10 years old?" However, Jessop added that "I think many of these things solve themselves with time."The announcement that Fidelity may add support for ETH next year comes at a time when institutional crypto trading platforms are competing for what seems to be a smaller pool of investors than many in the cryptosphere seem to have expected.Indeed, the launch of several institutional crypto products and platforms this year has left many industry participants wanting: notably, the launch of Van Eck's Bitcoin Trust, as well as some of the early trading volume figures on ICE's Bakkt (trading on the platform has since picked up speed.)ICYMI: Friday's Bakkt Bitcoin Monthly Futures: Traded contracts: 1551 ($11.23 million, -22%)

"And I think that down the road, you definitely will see more from the traditional asset managers-right now, we see more of the family offices who have broader discretionary ability to invest in things, or funds that are primarily hedge funds run by a couple parts."
