One that not only helps traditional asset managers dramatically lower costs, and tap into new investment asset classes, but also significantly lowers barriers to entry, and democratizes the allocation of resources to enable a new generation of digital asset managers."The company is also working to combine blockchain technology with the arbitrage mechanism to add another layer of security, providing accountability and transparency."Investing in digital assets remains an area of sustained interest, yet many see current investment infrastructure as inadequate for investors and fund managers," Heng Soon Pang, head of venture building at SGInnovate, added. "Leveraging the blockchain technology, the DEXTF protocol seeks to address this gap and democratize digital asset management in a secure and scalable way. We are excited to be a co-investor in DEXTF's seed funding round, to help scale their platform globally."
