While there are differences between fiat and cryptocurrencies, our technology and market experience have made the integration of cryptocurrencies and digital assets to our platform a smooth one."Fortex partnered with Tier1FX last year to jump in the crypto arena by offering CFDs of multiple digital assets, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple.The crypto CFDs offered by the platform have been adopted by multiple platforms, including Advanced Markets.Meanwhile, last month, the platform added single stock CFDs to its trade offering to provide broker-dealer clients the ability to trade stocks of more than 50 large-cap "blue chip" companies such as Apple, Google (Alphabet), Facebook, Amazon, Telsa, IBM, JP Morgan, Barclay, Alibaba, Baidu, and more."We very much look forward to further enhancing this part of our offering in line with our clients' needs," Young added.
