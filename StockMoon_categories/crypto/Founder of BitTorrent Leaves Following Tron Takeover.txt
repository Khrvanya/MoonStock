Two employees have been fired, and three have resigned. Two of the departed employees were in senior management, and the sources suggest that other members of management would like to leave but cannot due to 18-month contracts.Notably, one of the departures is Bram Cohen, the man who created BitTorrent back in 2004. Cohen told TorrentFreak, a blog that reports news about BitTorrent, that he no longer has an official role at the company, adding: "I have no involvement with Tron."Tron is a blockchain platform that intends to compete with Ethereum. It was created on the Ethereum blockchain by a Chinese national called Justin Sun, raised $70 million in its ICO, and began migrating to its own network in May. Tron's cryptocurrency, TRX, has a market cap of $1.3 billion, according to coinmarketcap.com, nowhere near Ethereum's $28.5 billion, but Sun told Forbes recently that the network already has over 200,000 active accounts.According to TorrentFreak, Sun has intimated that he intends to improve the BitTorrent file-sharing process by financially rewarding users that 'seed', which means leaving downloaded files open so that others can download it too.Said Sun: "By integrating the TRON network into Bittorrent, we aim to improve on the currently existing altruism. At this point, there are no incentives for peers who have completed downloading to continue to seed. We intend to extend rewards to peers who seed torrents, infusing more resources into the torrent ecosystem."Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>The benefit for Tron is clear - BitTorrent claims approximately 100 million users.
