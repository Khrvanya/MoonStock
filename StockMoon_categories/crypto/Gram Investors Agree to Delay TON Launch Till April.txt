It also provided the option of receiving a refund of 77 percent of the investments in case of any disagreement over the launch delay. The separate permissions were obtained from the investors of the two token sale rounds.Though the court hearing was originally scheduled for today, the judge extended the hearing until February 18-19 next year, forcing the project to stop distribution its tokens."The February hearings are different from the earlier scheduled for October 24, because at these hearings they should only consider the possible postponement of the launch of the platform," a letter to the Gram investors stated."We and our advisers will use the time to ensure that at the February hearing, the Telegram position is presented and supported as much as possible."
