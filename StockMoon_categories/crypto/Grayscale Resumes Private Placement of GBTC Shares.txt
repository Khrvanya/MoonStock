This creates a lack of liquidity as investors can't exit even in a bear market."Following a one-year holding period, shareholders who invest in the private placement may elect to sell their shares at prices dictated by the market under the symbol: GBTC," the company stated.The company also warned that on a secondary market, the shares might be traded at a premium price or even at a discount to the actual value of Bitcoin held by the trust."Because of the one-year holding period and the lack of an ongoing redemption program, shares should not be purchased by any investor who is not willing and able to bear the risk of investment and lack of liquidity for at least one year. No assurances are given that after the one-year holding period, there will be any market for the resale of shares, or, if there is such a market, as to the price at such shares may be sold into such a market," the announcement added.Finance Magnates earlier reported that the firm is planning to list the shares of its Ethereum Trust on retail markets after receiving approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).
