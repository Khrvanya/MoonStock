HBUS Closing Up Shop, Citing Strategic DecisionAfter a little more than a year of business, Huobi US (HBUS) will be ceasing all operations. The move will take effect as of December 15, 2019, with customers able to access their accounts for withdrawal up until January 31, 2020.The move represents a swift end for HBUS, having been in operation since the middle of 2018.Discover iFX EXPO Asia 2020 in Macao - The Largest Financial B2B ExpoThe company's rational for the decision reflects a need to shutter its operations so that, 'it can return in a more integrated and impactful fashion as part of its ongoing strategic layout.'Last month, Huobi made the decision to freeze all accounts of US users on November 13.
