Hackers offer Bitcoin and Ethereum in scam to YouTube usersNick Bertke, owner of the YouTube channel, Pogo, reported that it was hacked on January 14 this year. The artist, known for his musical collaborations with Disney, made the denunciation through his Twitter account. The hackers took control of his channel with more than 800,000 subscribers and are passing it off as an official channel of the Ethereum Foundation.Currently, the channel continues to broadcast under the name of Ethereum 2.0 Foundation. The perpetrators have announced their involvement in a false release of an Ethereum update. Under that premise they have begun offering a bogus giveaway that provides YouTube users with 10,000 Bitcoin (BTC) and 10,000 Ethereum (ETH).The bogus promotion celebrates the alleged listing of new fiat currencies in the cryptoexchange Binance and a release of Ethereum 2.0. The scam scheme not only has the above-mentioned fake rewards, but a set of rules that attempt to capture victims on Youtube. Giveaway participants must submit 5 ETH or 0.1 BTC to be part of the contest. In return, the scammers offer false rewards.The owner of the channel, Nick Bertke, stated the following:My YouTube channel is hacked. 13 years of content just got deleted. Hackers have transferred the channel to their account.The YouTube support team contacted the YouTuber. However, the broadcast continues and displays the face of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.My @YouTube channel is hacked. 13 years of content just got deleted. Hackers have transferred the channel to their account. @TeamYouTube has yet to step in and help despite my efforts. I'm sorry everybody. They look like scammers -- please avoid clickbait!-- POGO (@OfficialPogo) January 15, 2020After communicating with the Youtube team, Bertke was more optimistic and expects a positive result. Unfortunately, the YouTuber joins the long list of victims of attacks motivated by the theft or cryptocurrencies scams.The list of exchanges, institutions and users that have fallen victim to hackers is long. Among the most recent is the PlusToken scam. The attackers managed to move the Bitcoin and Ethereum funds of the PlusToken wallet users. The assets are estimated at around $3 billion and are still moving in the market. A study by Chainalysis even speculated on the funds' participation in the 2019 bear market.Another major hack affected the cryptoexchange Mt. Gox. At its peak, the exchange handled over 70% of all Bitcoin transactions. The attackers managed to steal 850,000 BTCs in 2014, causing the shutdown of Mt. Gox. The victims of the attack are still waiting for compensation for their losses.Follow us on Facebook and Twitter and don't miss any hot news anymore!
