(@BitTorrent) January 23, 2019Plans that BitTorrent would be launching its own cryptocurrency were originally announced on Thursday, January 3rd, 2019. The new coin, simply called 'BitTorrent Token' (BTT) will be used as a tool to incentivize actions that support peer-to-peer filesharing on the BitTorrent network.For example, users who download files from BitTorrent can then become "seeders"-they can users their own computer as a sort of node that will support other users who wish to download the same file. Previous to the creation of BTT, there was no incentive to do this other than good karma. Now, however, users who allow themselves to be used as "seeds" will be rewarded with BTT.Today we unveil our new token BitTorrent $BTT which features native TRC-10 compatibility and will be exclusively available to non-U.S. accounts on #BinanceLaunchpad, the token sale platform by leading cryptocurrency exchange @binance! ?

Shortly after the acquisition, TRON announced "Project Atlas," a plan to create a content-sharing ecosystem that would integrate with BitTorrent.TRON CEO Justin Sun sees the culmination of the project as an important step forward in global blockchain adoption. "In one giant leap," he said, "we can introduce blockchain to hundreds of millions of users around the world and empower a new generation of content creators with the tools to distribute their content directly to others on the web."
