For now, it supports high-volume block trades for BTC, USDT, HUSD, PAX, TUSD, and USDC. However, it has plans to add ETH, EOS, BCH, LTC, and XRP within the first quarter of this year."2019 brought the first wave of institutional interest but 2020 is when we expect to see the industry mature with growing demand. As we enter the next phase of crypto, Huobi is taking an active role in setting new standards for institutional and retail clients alike," Sun added.
