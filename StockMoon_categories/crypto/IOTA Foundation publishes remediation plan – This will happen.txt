IOTA Foundation publishes remediation plan – This will happenAlmost nine days after the hack of the IOTA Trinity wallet became known, the IOTA Foundation has now published a remediation plan. The plan includes a concrete action plan on how to get the IOTA network back up and running and how to prevent the hacker from using the stolen seeds to rob further IOTA from the Trinity wallet users.As the IOTA Foundation describes, on 12 February 2020, around 3 pm CET, it became aware of unauthorised outgoing transactions on previously positively balanced accounts, which forced the IOTA Foundation to make a prompt decision. Within the first four hours of the attack becoming known, the leadership made the decision to stop the Coordinator and thus bring the IOTA Tangle for value transactions to a standstill. What happened subsequently has already been reported in great detail.Now the IOTA Foundation has also commented on the actual course of events of the hack. It states that the integration of MoonPay was relatively quickly identified as the root cause. It was delivered as bundled code, as a so-called CDN (Content Delivery Network). Aware of the vulnerability of the CDN technology, the IOTA Foundation demanded a so-called NPM (Node Package Manager) from MoonPay. However, this was delivered late by MoonPay after much of the development work had already been done, which is why the integration did not take place before the launch of the Trinity Wallet (freely translated):
