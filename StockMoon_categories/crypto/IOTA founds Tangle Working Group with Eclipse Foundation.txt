IOTA founds Tangle Working Group with Eclipse FoundationThe IOTA Foundation today announced the next big bang headline. Together with the Eclipse Foundation, it has formed the Tangle EE Working Group. As the official announcement states, the Tangle EE brings together "a diverse group of leading companies, academics and standards bodies in the development of data, payment and identity solutions and tools for IOTA' Tangle.The news is significant because the Eclipse Foundation is one of the world's largest open source software development communities with over 275 members. The Eclipse Foundation is an independent, non-profit organization that maintains the development environment bearing the same name. Its members include strategic partners such as Fujitsu, Huawei, IBM, Oracle, Red Hat, Inc., Robert Bosch GmbH and SAP. In addition, the Eclipse Foundation has development partners such as AIRBUS, BMW, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Google Inc., Intel Corporation, Samsung, Siemens AG and Volkswagen.According to the official announcement, the founding members of the Tangle EE Working Group include 15 companies and educational institutions: Dell Technologies, STMicroelectronics, Software AG, Object Management Group, accessec, Energinet, BiiLabs, Calypso Network Association, ENGIE Lab CRIGEN, RWTH Aachen, AKITA, Geometric Energy Corporation, TMForum, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg and IoTIFY.The establishment of the Tangle EE Working Group is intended to accelerate the innovation rate of IOTA:We are well on our way to becoming the first truly scalable, feeless and decentralized Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and have solidified our role as a world-leading center for DLT research and development. It is now time to provide a vendor-neutral governance framework under which organizations can build enterprise-grade solutions on IOTA.In addition, the IOTA Foundation intends to provide companies with a secure legal framework when they build on the IOTA Tangle technology in the future:We want organizations to be confident that they can build and rely on IOTA as a new global infrastructure for decades to come. With the launch of Tangle EE, and its vendor-neutral open framework, we distribute governance in key IOTA use case areas.Organizations should be able to steer the direction of IOTA development and base their own products, services and intellectual property on IOTA without the risk of later license violation. The cooperation with the Eclipse Foundation is intended to ensure a highly professional environment.Furthermore, the authors also state that the Tangle EE Working Group is supposed to promote the commercialization of IOTA by allowing members to work together on projects. The first projects will focus on the topics "Unified Identity" and decentralized marketplaces.The Unified Identity Project will develop a protocol and other tools to realize a decentralized identity based on the Unified Identity Protocol of IOTA. The marketplace project will aim at the development of an industry diagnostic, decentralized marketplace where data, products and services can be traded in real time.In the official press release, David Sonstebo, co-founder of IOTA said:As an open-source project, we realize the importance of increasing access to IOTA's technology. This is a significant step forward for the IOTA Foundation and our ecosystem to develop a diverse, global community of contributors and adopters collaborating on production-ready commercial applicationsDominik Schiener, co-founder of the IOTA Foundation added:As IOTA's technologies continue to be adopted in commercial use cases, this transparent and open governance framework will be essential in regulating code development, ensuring market fit, and fulfilling our promises of openness, interoperability, and sustainability. This will elevate IOTA to production-readiness.The following video with Mike Milinkovich (Eclipse Foundation) and Dominik Schiener was also published.Follow us on Facebook and Twitter and don't miss any hot news anymore!
