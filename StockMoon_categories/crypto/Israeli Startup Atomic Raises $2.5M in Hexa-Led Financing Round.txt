This will eliminate the concerns of the security of a third-party platform."In today's world, when you want to take a loan, you need to go to a bank, get approvals, and put up your house or something else of value as collateral," Green added."When many physical assets will get their own digital representation such as real-estate tokens, equity/security tokens and more, this long and cumbersome process will move to the digital world and will take seconds. You'll be able to take a loan to buy a new car, locking up a small percentage of your portfolio as collateral, in mere seconds and without any need for a bank."The company is also working to enable micro-payments with instant confirmation to onboard the wide spectrum of merchants.
