Italy Makes First-Ever Official Move Toward Blockchain RegulationAccording to an official statement by the Senato della Repubblica on January 23rd, an amendment on blockchain industry regulation has been approved by two Italian senate committees, the committee of Constitutional Affairs and the committee of Public Works. The amendment represents the first time the Italian government has made any regulatory moves in the blockchain industry specifically.The amendment declares that blockchain-powered data records can be used to legally timestamp and validate documents: "the recording of an IT document through the use of technologies based on distributed ledgers produces the legal effects of the electronic time validation referred to in Article 41 of EU Regulation no. 910/2014."

The standards must be established within 90 days of the official approval of the amendment.The amendment also provides definitions for two blockchain industry terms, "distributed ledger technology" and "smart contract."Now that the amendment has gotten the approval of the committee of Constitutional Affairs and the committee of Public Works, it will need the approval of two Italian Parliament bodies: the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Although this may be the first big move that the Italian government has made toward the blockchain space, the government has been involved in the industry in the past.
