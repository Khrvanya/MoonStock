The Italian regulator warned that said brokers offer cryptocurrency-focused trading services without having the proper permissions.So far, Italy does not have specific legislation governing cryptocurrencies. The country's regulators only tried to provide a definition of the virtual assets exclusively for the purpose of AML laws, qualifying virtual currencies as a "digital representation of value not issued by a central bank or a public authority, not necessarily linked to a legal tender currency, used as a medium of exchange for purchases of goods and services, electronically transferred, stored and traded."Most recently, however, the finance ministry has completed its consultations on registration and reporting requirements of the blockchain industry. The bill draft requires crypto exchanges to report their activities in full to the authorities, which is an addition to the previous decree issued in May 2017.
