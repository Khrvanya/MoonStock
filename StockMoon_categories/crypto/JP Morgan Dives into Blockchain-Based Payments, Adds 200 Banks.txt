Now we're looking at the ability to do more at the point of settlement."Hunter also revealed that the bank has developed a feature which will ensure that a transaction has been made into a valid account in real time. This will resolve the issue of payment rejection even after days due to an error in the recipient's account number, sort code, or other details."Banks straight-through processing rates are in the mid-80s to the mid-90s. It's that gap -- the 5 to 20 percent of payments -- that have to be assessed by operations where we're trying to alleviate some of that pain," he added.Earlier this year, reports surfaced that the bank is developing its native digital currency to increase its settlement efficiency. The structure of the coin, however, received some criticisms from the crypto community as the bank is planning to restrict the use of the coin to its major institutional clients.JP Morgan has also become the largest blockchain employer in the financial services sector over the past 12 months, Finance Magnates reported last month.
