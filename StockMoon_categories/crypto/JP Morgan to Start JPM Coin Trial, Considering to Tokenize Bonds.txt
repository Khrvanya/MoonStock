It must be explained," Farooq added.JP Morgan announced its digital currency in February with an aim to use it to settle transactions of its corporate clients, increasing settlement efficiency. The currency is pegged to fiat to avoid any fluctuations in its value. The use of the currency is also limited within the bank's ecosystem as it cannot be traded in the secondary markets.The Wall Street giant is also investing heavily on blockchain technology and has developed a private decentralized network, called Quorum, based on Ethereum. It is also trying to capture the interbank market and on-boarded more than 200 banks on its Interbank Information Network (IIN).Wall Street is driving assets to EthereumSuggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Microsoft is driving developers to EthereumJP Morgan is driving banks to EthereumOpen Finance is driving value to EthereumAnd soon, Facebook will drive users to EthereumSeems like everyone is working for Ethereum these days-- Ryan Sean Adams (@RyanSAdams) June 25, 2019
According to Farooq, the bank needs some regulatory approvals before initiating the pilot transactions.The US bank has also partnered with Microsoft to handle the technical difficulties faced by its blockchain customers."We are a bank, and technical support for customers using quorum is not a core task," Farooq added.
