The claim was made that pool participants could get extraordinary investment returns - up to 300 percent in less than a week.McDonnell and CabbageTech sent investors false balance statements showing that their investments had been profitable, but "when investors requested refunds, McDonnell initially offered excuses for delays in repayment, and eventually stopped responding at all," stated United States Attorney Donoghue.Court documents also reveal that he used new investors' funds to pay back other investors in a Ponzi-like fashion, so that they would invest or refer additional money, thereby allowing the scheme to continue for a longer period of time. Instead of using the investors' monies in trading, the fraudsters misappropriated all of the funds, then removed the website and social media materials and ceased communicating with customers.
