For speculative positions, isolated margin mode may be a safer bet," Liquid noted in an announcement.To date, the Quoine subsidiary only offered cross-margin trading to its clients in which the margin is shared between two open positions and is entirely backed by the client's wallet balance.Explaining cross-margin trading, Liquid stated: "This margin method reduces the risk of liquidation.
