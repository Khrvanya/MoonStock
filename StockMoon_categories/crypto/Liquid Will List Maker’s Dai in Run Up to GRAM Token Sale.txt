Liquid Will List Maker’s Dai in Run Up to GRAM Token SaleCustomers of Japan-based Quoine subsidiary crypto exchange Liquid can now trade buy and sell Maker's Dai, a decentralized, ERC20-based stablecoin, according to a blog post from the exchange.Dai is an algorithmic stablecoin that controls is value by creating and burning tokens in accordance with supply and demand. It is collateralized with ETH, the native token of the Ethereum network. When the price of DAI exceeds USD$1, it can be sold for more than it's worth, which increases the coin's supply and causes it to fall back to USD$1; when it is below USD$1, users can use it to pay off debt within the system, which increases demand and raises the price.Discover the Barcelona Trading Conference - A Top Tier Crypto Trading EventWhile DAI isn't regulated, its decentralized governance and transparency model have caused some to believe that it is more secure than its centralized stablecoin counterparts, such as Tether dollars (USDT).However, another blog post from Liquid posted in November warned traders against becoming overly dependence on unregulated stablecoins: "the problem begins as dependence on these stablecoins grows. Trading with unregulated stablecoins could be extremely dangerous to crypto as a whole. If unregulated stablecoins fail, the effects can be catastrophic," the post explained.But the post also said that "stablecoins can and should be an excellent resource for traders, which is why exchanges have been quick to jump at the chance to list them, especially in absence of having the necessary regulatory approval to list fiat."Liquid made headlines earlier this month when it was announced that a sale of Telegram's highly-anticipated GRAM tokens would be hosted on the exchange. However, only USD and USDC can be used to buy GRAM tokens.The Gram Token Sale is coming to Liquid.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>For the first time, members of the public will be able to buy Telegram's sought-after $Gram tokens. $QASH holder benefits included.Get the inside scoop.https://t.co/atHGHUP32v-- Liquid (@Liquid_Global) June 11, 2019But the tokens being sold on Liquid are not actually being sold by Telegram itself, but by Gram Asia, the largest holder of Telegram tokens."We are excited to be partnering with Gram Asia to launch the Gram token sale, which is wonderful news to our community who are native users of Telegram," said Mike Kayamori, co-founder and CEO of Liquid.
