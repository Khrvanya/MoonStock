When the OKChain becomes stable, OKB will be migrated from the ERC-20 network to the OKChain mainnet," the exchange outlined.The cryptocurrency exchange will also make OKB token as the native token of the new blockchain."OKB will be the native token of the OKChain network, which can be used to settle transaction fees, or used in the Dapps developed on OKChain," the notification added.OKEx's shift towards decentralized exchange surfaced after its market rival Binance jumped into the sector. Binance has already launched the testnet of its decentralized exchange last month and after taking client's feedback, the exchange will decide whether it will run the DEX parallel to the existing exchange or make it the sole one.Last December, OKEx launched a cryptocurrency derivative platform called Perpetual Swap which works similar to the futures contracts but without any expiry date.
