OneCoin Mastermind Fled to Vienna or Athens, Says BrotherKonstantin Ignatov, who is accused of co-masterminding cryptocurrency pyramid scheme OneCoin working under his sister Ruja Ignatova, plead guilty to several charges, including money laundering and fraud.According to the BBC, Ignatov reached a deal with federal prosecutors on October 4 and appeared in court to enter his plea. Prosecutors didn't drop any counts of fraud or tax violations that may emerge, but Ignatov won't face further criminal charges related to the crypto scam that defrauded investors out of over $4 billion.London Summit 2019 Launches the Latest Era in FX and Fintech - Join NowHe faces up to 90 years in prison, though he's more likely to get less because he cooperated with authorities. The BBC report also states that Ignatov may qualify for the US witness protection scheme, where he could relocate and acquire a new identity, as cooperation with the authorities may "reveal activities of individuals who might use violence against him or his family."Despite desperately attempting to diminish his role within OneCoin, Ignatov ultimately revealed some details about the disappearance of his sister, implying even he was duped by Ignatova. He told the judge that the OneCoin founder described critics of her exit-scam as "haters," and that she was afraid somebody close to her was going to give her up to the FBI.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Ignatov, who is currently being held at the Metropolitan Correction Center, claims that Ignatova had got hold of a "big passport" and asked him to get her plane tickets to Vienna, Austria, and then Athens, Greece.OneCoin was founded in 2014 by Bulgarian businesswoman and Ruja Ignatova, who served as OneCoin's top leader until her disappearance two years ago.
