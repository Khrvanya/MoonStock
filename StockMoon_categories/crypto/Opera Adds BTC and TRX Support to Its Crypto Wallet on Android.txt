It first launched its built-in crypto wallet in December 2018 for Android devices and later in April brought that support to its PC browsers followed by iOS devices. As it is based on Web 3, no third-party browser extensions or wallet applications is required to access the wallet platform."Before Opera entered the cryptocurrency scene almost a year ago, using cryptocurrencies online and accessing Web 3 required special apps or extensions, which made it difficult for people to even try it out. Our browsers remove that friction," the technology company added.Android users with an operating system of version 6 or higher can use the crypto wallet by downloading the Opera browser beta from the Play Store.Earlier this year, Opera also partnered with HTC to bring decentralized applications (dApps) to Android. It also rolled out a cryptocurrency buying functionality to users of its 'Web 3-Ready' browser in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark.Moreover, to tackle the rampant crypto jacking, Opera last year added anti-cryptocurrency mining feature to its mobile-based browsers.
