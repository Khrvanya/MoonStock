It will also allow the simultaneous exchange of cash and securities to settle trades and is compatible with current systems, simplifying integration.Commenting on the development, Charles Cascarilla, co-founder and executive officer at Paxos, said: "The U.S. equities business continues to face unprecedented consolidation and economic pressures, requiring a comprehensive transformation of market structure. This is an important first step on our journey to reimagine the entire post-trade infrastructure, and one that creates immediate benefits for market participants."Meanwhile, the two partners also need to take permission from the financial market regulator to allow them to participate in the settlement process. Paxos is assuming that both its companies will receive SEC's green light in the next 30 days."We believe the process of securities settlement can be greatly optimized using blockchain, and with Paxos Settlement Service we will benefit from these efficiencies first hand. We see this as a significant and important milestone in our Digital Asset Markets strategy and foresee opportunities to leverage this product across numerous asset classes in the future," Emmanuel Aidoo, head of digital asset markets at Credit Suisse, said.
