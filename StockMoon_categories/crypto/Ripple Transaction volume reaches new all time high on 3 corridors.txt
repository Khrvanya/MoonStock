Ripple Transaction volume reaches new all time high on 3 corridorsAccording to data collected by the Liquidity Index Bot, Ripple recorded a new all-time high in transaction volume for 3 corridors. The new record follows the increasing trend that has been seen in transaction volume in the Mexico corridor with the XRP/MXN pair and the Philippines corridor with the XRP/PHP pair since late 2019. Ripple's most recent corridor was opened in Australia with the XRP/AUD pair.On February 7, 2020, the transaction volume for the XRP/MXN pair was 17,228,102 XRP. As reported by CNF, Ripple's payment corridor to Mexico is one of the fastest growing. The transaction volume for this corridor has doubled since December 2019. The growth is attributed to the high level of participation that Mexico plays in the remittance market to Latin America.In addition, Ripple partnered with the Mexican exchange Bitso in October of last year. The cooperation allows Bitso to use Ripple's On Demand Liquidity product to make cross-border payments. The Mexican exchange converts XRP into the national currency, the Mexican peso.Liquidity Index for Bitso XRP/MXN Source: https://twitter.com/LiquidityB/status/1225857110686257153/photo/1On the other hand, Ripple's payment corridor for the Philippines continues to perform well.
