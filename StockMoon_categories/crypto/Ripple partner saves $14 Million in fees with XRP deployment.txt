BeeTech already belongs to RippleNet and is very pleased with the results.Founder and CSO Alexandre C.R. Liuzzi of BeeTech lives in Brazil and knows the international challenges of sending and receiving transactions. On average, sending money to Brazil is very expensive worldwide for various legal and political reasons.In total, more than three million Brazilians live abroad and almost one million foreigners live in Brazil, so there is a need for fast, cheap transactions to and from Brazil. A volume of more than USD 1.5 trillion was processed.BeeTech has specialized in solving this problem and has been working with RippleNet ever since. His personal experiences reflect the fate and everyday life of countless families.

BeeTech's collaboration with RippleNet has resulted in strong progress. Liuzzi describes:With Ripple, we've standardized the process for integration across different rails and increased efficiency in settlement. We're saving our customers more than $14 million in transaction fees. We're talking about families who are sending money to their children studying abroad and small businesses whose main source of income comes from exports. This is huge for themBeeTech plans to expand into other countries such as the United States of America and Europe next year.BeeTech is one of MoneyGram's many satisfied customers who use the company's payment service.
