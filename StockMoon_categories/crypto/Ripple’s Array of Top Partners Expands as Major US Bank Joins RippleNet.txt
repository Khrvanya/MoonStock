Because its xRapid solution has a much shorter transaction time, there have been major companies testing the product such as Western Union and Moneygram, but none have committed to it fully.The value of Ripple's cryptocurrency, however, has failed to react to the growing acceptance of products developed by the California-based blockchain specialist.Earlier in May, Ripple revealed some results from the first pilot for xRapid. The company said financial institutions using the service paid between 40 and 70 percent less than they usually pay traditional foreign exchange providers for the same service. Also, transactions with xRapid took mere minutes, while the average cross-border transfer using traditional means takes 2-3 days.According to the company statement, "the addition of a top U.S. bank like PNC on RippleNet fuels the network's positive momentum. RippleNet has grown to more than 100 financial institutions and continues to expand steadily each month. RippleNet has also recently expanded its reach to over 40 countries and six continents."
