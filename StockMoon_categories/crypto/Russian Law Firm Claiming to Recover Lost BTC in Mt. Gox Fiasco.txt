Gox landed on other doomed Russian exchanges like BTC-e and WEX."Our plan is to represent the Mt.Gox creditors and help them report to Russian law enforcement so that the investigators could establish the connection between the stolen funds from Mt Gox, the operations of BTC-e and WEX, using Vinnik's case," Zheleznikov said."If our assumptions of those connections are correct, the [thieves] will ultimately come forward and plead guilty, and to reduce the punishment, they will offer to recover a part of the funds. If they don't, they will be deemed guilty by law enforcement, and then there will be a chance to sue them for damages based on the criminal case."Earlier, reports surfaced that Fortress Investment Group, a New York-based private equity company, was offering Mt. Gox creditors $900 per Bitcoin to purchase their claims.
