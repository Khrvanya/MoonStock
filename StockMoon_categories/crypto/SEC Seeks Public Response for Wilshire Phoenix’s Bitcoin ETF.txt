Focusing on the spot market is appropriate because the spot market is the market to which the particular ETP would look to determine its [net asset value]," the filing added.The asset management firm first filed for the Bitcoin and T-Bill backed fund in May. However, the decision to its proposal was pushed back by the regulator in September.The notice by the financial watchdog came only a week after its rejection of a similar ETF proposed by Bitwise in conjunction with NYSE Arca. Citing concerns about market manipulation and a lack of surveillance-sharing agreements, it put the burden of rejection on NYSE Arca, which is also a part of this proposal.
