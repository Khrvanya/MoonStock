Welshhans, associate director in the SEC's division of enforcement, said: "BCOT did not provide ICO investors with the information they were entitled to receive in connection with a securities offering. We will continue to consider appropriate remedies, such as those in today's order, to provide investors with compensation and required information and to provide companies who conducted unregistered offerings with an opportunity to move forward in compliance with the federal securities laws."Earlier this week, the regulatory agency charged blockchain project Shopin for defrauding hundreds of investors by raising $42 million with the selling of unregistered securities.
