Per the announcement, as of May 31 rebalancing, the ETP includes eight crypto assets - Bitcoin (67.80 percent), Ethereum (11.50 percent), Ripple (8.33 percent), Bitcoin Cash (3.52 percent), Litecoin (3.47 percent), EOS (3.36 percent), Stellar (1.10 percent) and Cardano (0.90 percent).The Swiss stock exchange is one of the few major exchanges which is investing heavily on crypto. Finance Magnates earlier reported that the exchange is developing its own cryptocurrency and already spent $20 million on its upcoming blockchain-based trading platform. It is also reportedly working on a Swiss franc-pegged stablecoin."We are thrilled to be working with Amun to help investors gain diversified exposure to the most important crypto projects. The Index is carefully designed to capture a broad array of crypto assets while accounting for many of the unique constraints presented by the current cryptocurrency ecosystem," Matt Hougan, global head of research for Bitwise Asset Management, added.
