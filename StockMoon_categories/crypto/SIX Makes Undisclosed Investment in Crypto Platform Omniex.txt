As such, the new deal handles some of its unique market challenges, including connectivity, features, and high-performance trading experience, for institutions seeking exposure to crypto-assets."Together with SIX we aim to offer an end-to-end solution for the trading and settlement of digital assets, including the SIX Digital Exchange (SDX), once operationally live. It will still take some time, but the cornerstones are in place to accelerate the broader adoption of natively digitalized assets," said Hu Liang, CEO and co-founder Omniex.The Omniex platform provides an end-to-end solution for portfolio and risk management, trade execution, and compliance, as well as algorithmic execution and smart order routing services.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Omniex, which has offices in San Francisco and California, says the crypto assets have many unique attributes not seen in other financial markets.

The digitalization of each asset would go through a rigorous review process before adding it to the exchange.Thomas Zeeb, head securities & exchanges at SIX, further states: "We see a growing need in the market to access crypto currencies. Our new collaboration will provide a standardized and secure gateway via SIX as the trusted partner of the financial industry.
