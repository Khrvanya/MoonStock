"We are getting very positive feedback from recently on-boarded customers, and we are quickly on-boarding more investors and trading firms from around the world."Wednesday's news comes less than two weeks after Seed CX released details of its new wallet.

Unless something drastic happens, that would also make Seed CX the first firm to offer multiple fiat currencies on a single platform.Institutions that trade on the platform will not be subject to any deposit or withdrawal fees - for both cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.Like some other cryptocurrency exchanges, the firm will also be operating under a maker-taker model. That means market makers will not be charged for trading on the exchange and, according to the firm, market takers will be subject to the industry's lowest trading fees.
