While it managed to raise over $250 million in two ICOs rounds, the current market capitalization of its SRN token is now less than $3 million. It reached a peak of $3.27 in January 2018, exactly when crypto hype started to give way to a deep crash leading to a constant depression of the token, despite some short-lived speculative pumps.Sirin Labs previously partnered with a number of crypto services providers to bring the FINNEY to a wider mass. To promote the product, the company signed Barcelona star Lionel Messi as its brand ambassador back in December 2017.The company is also no strange to the software field as it has SIRIN OS, which is designed to support inherent blockchain applications such as cold storage crypto wallet, secure exchange access, encrypted communications and a P2P resource sharing ecosystem for payment and apps.As a direct result of the growing demand that Hogeg predicts, Sirin Labs plans to leverage its brick-and-mortar locations, including its flagship store in London's Mayfair, to sell cybersecurity products as well.
