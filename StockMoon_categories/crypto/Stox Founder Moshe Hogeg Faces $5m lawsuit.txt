According to Israeli outlet Calcalist, the whitepaper said that the company would be launched in conjunction with Invest.com.Hogeg claimed that Invest.com had three million users, that it had revenues in 2016 of over $50 million and that each user would be issued with a cryptocurrency wallet which they could then use to access Stox's services.None of this happened. At the time of publication, Invest.com only had a landing page, and Stox had less than 1,000 downloads on the Android application store. The company currently only offers access to a form of sports betting, but it is unclear as to whether this is even operational.
