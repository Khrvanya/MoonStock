The STO platform builds on the functionality of the Stratis ICO platform with the addition of several new features that satisfy the rigorous regulatory requirements needed to conduct STOs. Our STO Platform is highly secure, flexible and scalable, making it easy for businesses of any size to raise money through the tokenization of their assets."Stratis also detailed that it developed the platform using C# and the .NET Core. The STO platform will accept payments in both fiat and digital currency, but the support will be limited to the US dollar, Bitcoin, and the platform's native token STRAT.In addition, to add an additional layer of security, the platform will use wallets rather than autonomous smart contracts.The announcement also revealed that as the first STO on its platform, it will list GLU token next year, which is currently fulfilling legal issues with the SEC.Meanwhile, many major crypto players are also diving into the STO arena, which seems to be very lucrative. In October, Black Manta Capital and Tokeny joined forces for the development of a similar platform for the European markets.
