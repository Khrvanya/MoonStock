"There is no digital state money available to the general public, however, and the digital money and payment methods that are available are provided by private market players. The digital money is, therefore, a claim on a private player in contrast to cash which is a claim on the state."Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>The announcement explained that e-krona would only be a digital version of the country's fiat, reducing the risk of the krona's position being weakened by competing for private currency alternatives.The central bank has chosen IT giant Accenture to provide the underlying technology for issuing the digital currency.
