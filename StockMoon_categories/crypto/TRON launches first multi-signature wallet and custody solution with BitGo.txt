For a transaction to be released, several signatures must "sign" an existing signature with their private key, thus confirming that the transaction is trustworthy and may be released.Multi-Signature Wallets use different private keys, which are assigned to several persons, to increase accountability, security and transparency, which cannot be achieved by other technologies so far.In order to offer institutional investors a secure storage solution for their TRX, TRON in cooperation with BitGo has developed a custody service that meets the high compliance requirements and sufficient transparency.
