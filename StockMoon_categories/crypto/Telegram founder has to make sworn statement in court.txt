Telegram founder has to make sworn statement in courtOn 12 October 2019, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an emergency lawsuit and interim injunction against Telegram Group Inc. and its subsidiary TON Issuer. Both companies are responsible for Telegram's initial coin offering. They are accused of conducting an unregistered "digital token offering in the USA and abroad".On 25.11.2019 the District Judge Castel of the New York Southern District Court decided that the founder Pavel Durov as well as other employees have to make affidavits. Ilya Perekopsky, vice president of Telegram, has been summoned for 16.12.2019. Another employee who was familiar with the 1.7 billion USD Gram sale will testify on 10.12.2019.In detail, the SEC accuses Telegram of selling the GRAM tokens as unregistered securities to audited investors. In order to sell securities in the United States, a detailed application must be filed with the SEC in advance, which will then be reviewed under applicable securities laws.Only then will approval be granted and the company may sell the securities. Telegram has assumed that the GRAM token will be classified as a capital good and has therefore waived such a request. However, the SEC disagrees.On 31.10.2019 the start of the Telegram network was postponed to 30.04.2019 due to a preliminary injunction of the SEC. The investors had the choice of a refund of their invested capital or the approval to postpone the launch. The investors agreed to the postponement.In a further letter from Telegram to the SEC, the company appeals that the accusations presented should be dropped in most respects and the charges should be dropped. The report describes that GRAM tokens were not securities at the time of issuance:
