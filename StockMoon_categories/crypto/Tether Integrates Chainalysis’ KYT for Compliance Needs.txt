Many raised questions about the value of its fiat chest, which are backing the stablecoin; however, the company was reluctant to conduct a third-party audit.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>"By putting proper AML transaction monitoring in place, Tether is demonstrating its commitment to transparency and regulatory compliance, further building trust among its growing user base," Levin added.The stablecoin company has integrated the API of Chainalysis' KYT solution.Introduced last April, other notable clients of Chainalysis' KYT solution include exchanges like Bitfinex, which is controlled by the same parent as Tether."Working with Chainalysis has allowed us to enhance our AML processes for all transactions involving the Tether token," said Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer at Tether, said.
