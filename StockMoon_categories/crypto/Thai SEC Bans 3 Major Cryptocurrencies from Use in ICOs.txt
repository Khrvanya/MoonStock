Thai SEC Bans 3 Major Cryptocurrencies from Use in ICOsThe ThaiSecurities and Exchange Commission has made the decision to remove three major cryptocurrencies from a list of digital currencies that are allowed to be used as ICO investments and in base trading pairs for digital asset trading, according to a new report from the Bangkok Post.Indeed, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum Classic are technically no longer allowed for use in Thai ICOs. However, the Bangkok Post explained that "such removal does not have an impact on investors or businesses involved with digital assets, since there is still no authorised ICO and local digital exchanges [that] use BCH, ETC and LTC as base trading pairs."Asia Trading Summit - The Leading Investment Event in ChinaThe list still allows Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Stellar to be used in ICO investing and as a base trading pair for registered digital asset exchanges.
