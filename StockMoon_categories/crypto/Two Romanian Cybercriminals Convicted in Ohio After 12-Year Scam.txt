"Money mules" then collected the cash and then delivered it to the defendants.A report from Cleveland.com said that it only took "two mistakes" for law enforcement to identify members of the group. At the time of their conviction, millions of dollars had been stolen.In June of last year, Carbon Black Security strategist Rick McElroy told CNBC that $1.1 billion had been stolen by cybersecurity thieves in the first six months of 2018 - and that it was "easy."He also said that many cybercriminals are not evil, but that they are simply people who may need money for basic necessities. "You have nations that are teaching coding, but there's no jobs," McElroy said. "It could just be two people in Romania needing to pay rent."However, the scale of the Bayrob group's crimes suggests that they used the stolen cash to pay for more than just the cost of living.
