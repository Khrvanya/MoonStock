The agency, at the same time granted a license to Prime Factor Capital, the first crypto-based hedge fund in the country."Our new plan represents a step-change in our response, bringing together the public and private sectors to relentlessly pursue the perpetrators and their dirty money," Sajid Javid, the home secretary, added.
