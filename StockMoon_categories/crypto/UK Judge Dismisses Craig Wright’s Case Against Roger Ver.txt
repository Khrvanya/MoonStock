In consequence, the Court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the action. The action will be struck out."The court also pointed out that the submitted evidence does not entirely fall under the jurisdiction of England and Wales, as it is more appropriate for a United States court.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>"The evidence clearly demonstrates that the most substantial publication of the statements complained of is in the U.S. It is common ground that, of the global publication, only some 7% took place in England and Wales," the Justice added."There is no evidence at all of any actual reputational harm that the Claimant has suffered as a result of any of the defendant's publications," the court document added.Wright is one of one most controversial figures in the crypto community.
