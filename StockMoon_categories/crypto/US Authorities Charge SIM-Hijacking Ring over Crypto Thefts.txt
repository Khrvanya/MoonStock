Discoveries by state investigators led to identifying files with a list of names and phone numbers, along with SIM cards and cell phones.The indictment alleges that once "The Community" had control of a victim's phone number, the phone number was leveraged as a gateway to gain control of online accounts such as a victim's email, cloud storage, and cryptocurrency exchange accounts.
