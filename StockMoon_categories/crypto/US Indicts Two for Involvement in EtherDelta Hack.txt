In November 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US charged him for operating an unregulated securities exchange and fined $400,000.Last month, Primitive Ventures-founding partner Dovey Wan revealed that the Chinese authorities are now investigating EtherDelta under the suspicion of an exit scam pulled off by the new owners of the exchange.
