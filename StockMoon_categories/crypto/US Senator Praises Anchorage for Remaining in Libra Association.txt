US Senator Praises Anchorage for Remaining in Libra AssociationFollowing much hostility from US Legislators and the withdrawal of seven companies from the so-called Libra Association (the organization of backers for Facebook's global cryptocurrency project), one US Senator has stepped forward to show support for Libra.Indeed, US Senator Mike Rounds (R-SD) sent an open letter to Anchorage, a trust co0mpany based in his home state, praising the company for its decision to stay in the Association: "your willingness to take risks in an effort to improve the lives of Americans and our neighbors across the globe is one of the hallmarks of what makes our country great," he wrote.London Summit 2019 Launches the Latest Era in FX and Fintech - Join NowSouth Dakota has previously been recognized as a leader of cryptocurrency-related legislative efforts within the US. The state is home to the country's first "Trust Task Force", and BitGo has been based in South Dakota since 2018. In July, Anchorage announced an initiative to build a "smart" crypto custody firm in South Dakota.Notably, the letter from Senator Rounds follows another letter that was sent to a number of Libra Association members by Brian Schatz and Sherrod Brown, who are respectively the Democratic senators of Hawaii and Ohio.In the Anchorage letter, Rounds said that "it is profoundly disappointing that my colleagues chose to address your peers in such an ominous tone, which I fear may put a chill on innovation in the long run," and expressed concerns that the US was lagging behind in the global digital economy.Specifically, Rounds referred to the fact that by 2022, payments made from digital wallets "will comprise less than 10 percent of U.S. consumer in-person point of sale payments," while Africa already had "100 million active mobile money accounts" in 2017. He also noted that mobile payment transaction volume in the US is dwarfed by China's.Rounds also said that he found the negative reaction to Libra to be "puzzling" due to the age of US securities laws: "that law was written more than half a century before computers and the internet were created, more than two decades before Hawai'i was admitted to the Union, a decade before the jet engine was developed, and in a period of time in which 90 percent of rural America lacked electricity," he wrote.However, Senator Rounds' letter did not directly address some of the concerns that Schatz' and Brown's letter contained regarding Facebook's integrity.The letter, which was shared on Twitter by Gabor Gurbacs, digital asset strategist/director at VanEck, said that "Facebook is currently struggling to tackle massive issues, such as privacy violations, disinformation, election interference, discrimination, and fraud, and it has not demonstrated an ability to bring those failures under control."Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>> This is the type of letter executives at @stripe, @Mastercard and @visa (former @Libra_ members) have received.
