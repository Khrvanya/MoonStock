VeChain based marketplace Real Items launchedReal Items has launched yesterday its VeChainThor blockchain based marketplace for consumers and producers. The company uses the VET blockchain to validate the authenticity of products and store all the data of the supply chain on the VeChainThor blockchain. The users of the marketplace can use a QR code placed on the traded product and receive comprehensive information about the supply chain and the authenticity of the product.Each Real Item is linked to a non-fungible token (NFT). In the Real Items portfolio manager, each item displays the blockchain transaction ID, block number, timestamp, etc., which is linked to VeChain's block explorer for validation.In order to use these Real Items functionalities, an account with Real Items is required to manage the tokens and transfer ownership to other people. The verification of an item is basically free of charge and does not require a transaction on the VeChainThor blockchain, as Real Items clarified via Twitter. To handle this, Real Items uses the VeChain Multi-Party Payment Protocol (MPP).MPP is a patent pending payment model within the base protocol of the VeChainThor blockchain. It allows parties other than the sender involved in an on-chain transaction to choose to pay the blockchain the network fees for that transaction. This enables companies to pay for the fees of their customers who do not own assets when it comes to proving ownership of data.Only if the user wants to transfer the NFT to his own wallet or to the wallet of another user, VTHO will be charged for the transaction. To launch the platform, Real Items transferred 8 million VeChain Thor Token (VTHO) to their account.To celebrate the launch of the platform, Real Items is offering a VeChain coffee mug to celebrate the launch. As it is also stated on the product, for each cup a transaction is generated on the VeChainThor blockchain.Do you wake up in the morning and check your crypto news thinking, why isn't my coffee cup on the blockchain yet? We got you Fam.  Every real item comes with a VeChain NFT for product authenticity.  Grab your piece of blockchain history! https://t.co/5PFrDDObQ6 #NoFakes pic.twitter.com/GcRUAoLP6b-- Real Items V (@itemsdapp) February 23, 2020Last week the Manager for VeChainStats was released.
