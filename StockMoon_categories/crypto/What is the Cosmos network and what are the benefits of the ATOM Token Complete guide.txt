What is the Cosmos network and what are the benefits of the ATOM Token Complete guideCosmos (ATOM) is a decentralized ecosystem of independent blockchains designed to create the next generation of Internet. Almost every crypto project develops its own blockchain. No matter whether Bitcoin, Ethereum or Ripple, the different technologies are usually not compatible with each other. Note:To understand the vision of Cosmos, it is essential to understand the blockchain technology. You can find a detailed guide to the Blockchain in this article (click!).Instead of continuing this trend, Cosmos intends to connect all blockchain projects and develop an Internet of Blockchains (IoB). The different blockchains remain independent of each other, but retain the possibility of communication and the exchange of e.g. data and coins. To achieve interoperability, Cosmos (ATOM) uses a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus algorithm.As if that wasn't enough, Cosmos wants to continue solving the following blockchain technology problems:Cosmos has the following solutions for the problems described above:
