Tal Ron, Chairman, and CEO of Tal Ron, Drihem & Co dives in to give his perspective on what is in store for projects.MasterCard's new requirements currently apply to Financial Institutions, businesses that disburse their own funds to their consumers or small business customers, Licensed Money Transmitters, and organizations which are not required to register as a licensed money transmitter.Furthermore, MasterCard specifically added merchants involved in the following activities to its Business Risk Assessment and Mitigation (BRAM) program: Contracts for Difference (CFD), Foreign exchange (Forex) trading, Cryptocurrency options trading, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).This means that today, all merchants involved in the above-mentioned activities can no longer submit transactions via the MasterCard network without being legally authorized to do so in the jurisdictions where the cardholders reside.In order to demonstrate such compliance, MasterCard requires all merchants to register with the MasterCard Registration Program (MRP)and demonstrate compliance with the newly introduced requirements. Failure to do so will lead to possible fines raised as a result of BRAM violations.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>In order to comply, the registration process requires each Merchant to provide (a) Evidence that you are legally authorized to perform the above-listed activities, including a copy of the Merchant's license or a reasoned legal opinion from a local lawyer, accredited by IMGL and STEP, and (b) a certification of effective controls.Some of the most popular jurisdictions nowadays include Estonia, Malta, and Singapore.Yes.

Malta adopted three laws: the Malta Digital Innovation Authority Act, which establishes the Malta Digital Innovation Authority and certifies DLT platforms, the Innovative Technology Arrangements and Services Act, which concerns the setting up of exchanges and other companies operating in the cryptocurrency market, and the Virtual Financial Assets Act, which sets up the regulatory regime governing ICOs, cryptocurrency exchanges, and wallet providers.The final choice is up to your personal preferences, business goals, and legal counseling, but all of the jurisdictions listed above also offer preferential tax programs and will help you set up a regulated crypto business according to your needs.It is strongly advised for such firms to obtain sufficient legal advice, become fully compliant with regulators and local tax and AML authorities, and obtain required legal opinions, especially since Mastercard and Visa's requirements will surely be adopted by other providers in the future.Tal Ron will be speaking at the upcoming London Summit 2018, exploring life after the new regulations.
