This also made the currency popular among cybercriminals, as on multiple occasions, online extortions were demanded in the form of Zcash.The potential threat of criminal activities with the coin also forced two major digital asset exchanges - UpBit and OKEx - to delist the currency along with a number of other cryptos, including Dash.However, Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges by trade volume, has recently listed Zcash on its newly launched United States subsidiary.Last month, a blockchain developer also revealed a bug on most of the forks of Zcash, which could leak metadata containing the full nodes' with shielded IP addresses.Malware is common in the crypto industry as hackers are constantly trying to siphon funds using different tactics. Crypto mining malware is one of the most common forms, usually injected into victims' computers to mine digital currencies.
