Kistner also assured that all funds of the platform's users are safe.Following the first attack, the platform also decided to integrate Chainlink's solutions to flag suspicious transactions, and after the second attack, the process has been expedited, Kistner revealed on Telegram.From what I can tell, it was some type of manipulation of sUSD via kyber. Looks like the eth was sold for sUSD over and over and over then rebought and had a profit after loan (7500 eth) was repaid.-- eric.eth (@econoar) February 18, 2020"Note that this is not yet a loss, but has the potential to become a loss," Kistner mentioned about the impact of the first attack. "According to our calculations, the collateral currently residing in our vault is enough to service interest payments at market rates on the loan for hundreds of years if nothing is done. However, there is an element of volatility risk since the collateral is in wBTC, the interest is denominated in ETH, and interest is only converted into ETH every 28 days."
