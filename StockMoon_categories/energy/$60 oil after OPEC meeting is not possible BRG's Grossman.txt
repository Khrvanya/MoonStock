  It's not possible for oil to fall to $60 a barrel after OPEC  meets this week to discuss output policy, Jeff Grossman, president of BRG Brokerage, told  CNBC on Monday.  While the chance of a big price cut is small, he said, the cartel  will likely announce that it has discussed reducing production in  order to stem the tide of lower prices and put a bottom on the  market.  "Even with some serious tempering of weather, the market could  possibly go to maybe $72 in the next four to six weeks," Grossman  told "Power Lunch." "The most optimistic bear would have to be in  agreement with that."

Members such as Venezuela and Iran have called for the organization to draw down production, but it remains uncertain whether Saudi Arabia, the group's largest producer, will agree to a cut.
