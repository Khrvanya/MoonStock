  Saudi Arabia's 30-year-old deputy crown prince's ambitious  economic "vision" to diversify the economy could include 5  million new jobs for the kingdom.      One Saudi watcher said the goal would be to create the millions  of jobs over a number of years across several sectors in a newly  diversified economy. That may even include a plan to turn Saudi  Arabia into a global logistics hub between Asia and Europe.  But analysts expect the plan, to be unveiled Monday, will be light  on details and still unclear in how it will be implemented.
