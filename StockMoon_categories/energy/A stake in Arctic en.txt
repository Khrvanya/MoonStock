Novak declared that there is a list of 23 projects that might be developed, adding that the LNG accord is likely to be inked later this year.
 
Novak considers that collaboration between the two nations could extend in the future if the Saudis take up the offer.
 
Moscow invited the kingdom's national oil firm Saudi Aramco to take part of the project in 2017. Arctic LNG-2 is guided by Russian gas producer Novatek, which wants to start construction of the first LNG train in 2022 or 2023. The project's yearly capacity will be over 18 million tons of LNG. It will represent the second large-scale LNG project conducted by Novatek, after Yamal LNG.
