RenewableA third of Germany's electricity in 2017 was supplied by renewable energy, according to the calculations made by the Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW).The proportion of green power in the mix rose from 29% in 2016, partly because of wind energy turning into the third biggest electricity source, exceeding natural gas and nuclear energy.
 
According to BDEW, the proportion of coal in the country's electricity production mix dropped from 40.3% in 2016 to 37% in 2017 as six coal-fired power plants were closed.

Nevertheless, it cautioned that if policymakers do not make huge investments in alternative energy and low-emission natural gas plants, the reduction of coal and lignite power plants will make a shortage of available energy in 2023.

Stefan Kapferer, Chairman of the BDEW, declared: "The figures show impressively that there is already an accelerated shift in power generation from carbon dioxide-intensive to low-carbon and almost carbon dioxide-free energy sources. The energy industry is clearly on course with regard to energy and climate targets: our industry is able to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40% by 2020 compared to 1990."
