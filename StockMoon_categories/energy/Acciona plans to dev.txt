SolarAcciona Energia, a subsidiary of the Spanish company Acciona, will develop three $180m solar photovoltaic (PV) plants with a total capacity of 150MW (186 MW-peak) in Egypt. These will require an investment of approximately $180 million.
  Acciona Energia will build and share the project 50-50 with its partner Swicorp (Saudi Arabia) which will be represented by Enara Bahrain Spv Wll, its renewable energy platform.

According to Acciona Energia, the three identical PV plants record its first green energy project in Egypt, which will be situated in the Benban complex in the Aswan region.

Acciona Energia CEO Rafael Mateo said: "We are very pleased to increase our presence in an area with great potential in the long run for the renewable energy sector as is North Africa, working with such reputable partner as Swicorp"

The construction of the power plants could start in December 2017, while their operations are expected to begin in December 2018.
 
The three solar plants will produce enough energy to meet the electricity demand of around 150,000 Egyptian households. At the same time, they would reduce 297,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions.
