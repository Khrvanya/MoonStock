Oil prices took a tumble after some of the world's largest oil  exporters failed to reach an agreement in Doha, Qatar, to freeze  output to January levels. In February, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Venezuela had agreed  to freeze output if other producers joined them - and Sunday's  meeting in Doha was expected to formalize that agreement.The major sticking point during the meeting was the heightened  tension between Saudi Arabia, the defacto OPEC leader, and Iran,  which recently returned to the international oil market after  sanctions against the country were lifted earlier this  year.   Prior to the meeting, Iran made a last-minute decision not to  attend. The country has consistently said it would not consider  an output freeze or halt until it reached its pre-sanctions level  of production.  Cushioning the blow from the failure to reach a deal are signs  that the physical supply market may be tightening.   Oil workers in Kuwait started to strike at the weekend to protest  cuts to benefits and wages. Reuters reported the strike could  have cut Kuwait's oil production from 2.85 million barrels per  day to just 1.1 million barrels a day.   In this week's Trader Poll, tell us what's in store for oil.
