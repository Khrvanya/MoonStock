  U.S. drillers have the ability to double the country's oil  production to 20 million barrels a day, but doing so too soon  would tank oil prices, Continental Resources CEO Harold Hamm said  Thursday.  Hamm, who made his fortune by pioneering new drilling methods in  North Dakota's Bakken Formation, did not offer a timeline for  when this would be possible, but it would certainly be a  difficult task. Surging U.S. production since 2008 was largely  responsible for creating a global oversupply of oil that sent  prices spiraling from more than $100 a barrel to $26 this past  winter.  The billionaire oilman and energy advisor to President-elect  Donald Trump acknowledged the difficulty of such a renewed boom  in oil production.  "We could take it from 10 [million barrels a day] to 20  [million]. The key here is not to get too much production coming  back in — oversupply the market — or prices collapse and that's  not a good deal for everybody," Hamm told CNBC's "Squawk on the  Street."  "We have that potential in this country. That's what's available  here. It needs to be done in a very systematic way," he said.  U.S. crude oil production hit a multidecade peak of 9.6 million  barrels a day in April 2015, roughly doubling from 2008 levels  near 5 million barrels a day. That output has since slid back to  about 8.6 million barrels a day as U.S. drillers defer new  projects amid the price slump.  On Wednesday, the Organization of the  Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia agreed  to limit production to boost prices. Many analysts say they must  be careful not to let oil prices rise and stay above $55 a  barrel, or else producers of high-cost U.S. crude could increase  their output and upset the quest to balance the market.
