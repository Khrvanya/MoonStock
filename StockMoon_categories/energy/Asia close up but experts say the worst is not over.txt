Major Asian markets closed in positive territory on Tuesday, extending Monday's rally,  but experts are not convinced this is the end of the  volatility that has rocked stock markets since the beginning of  2016.   Thomas Poullaouec, managing director and head of strategy  research for Asia Pacific at State Street Global Advisors, told  CNBC's "Squawk  Box" that despite the relative calm seen in markets on Monday and  Tuesday, the prospect of volatility remains.  "We don't think this is the end," he said, adding that markets would stabilize once there was stability in oil prices, global financial conditions and the Chinese economy.  "These three conditions are not there yet, so crisis is still the  mode," he said.   Evan Lucas, market strategist at spreadbetter IG, said in his  morning note that "macro overreach" was still a very real  problem. But he added, "fear and pessimism factors versus slowing  macro themes are two very different things, which explain the  overreach."  Fear factors hanging over markets include China, oil and negative  interest rates, according to Lucas.  Chinese markets, on their second day of trading after returning  from a week-long Lunar New Year break, led Asian markets as the  closed up 91.21 points, or 3.32 percent, at 2,837.40. The Shenzhen composite ended 71.69 points, or 4.09 percent, higher to 1,821.70.   Though China's trade balance for January, released Monday, was  weak, comments from the People's  Bank of  China (PBOC) governor sent the yuan to its strongest  level against the dollar for the year, with the  pair at 6.4943 at  yesterday's market close. The pair traded higher on Tuesday, up  0.21 percent at 6.5081.   Japan's , which surged 7 percent yesterday, erased early morning losses to close up 31.85 points, or 0.2 percent, at 16,054.43. Across the Korean Strait, the Kospi finished 26.10 points, or 1.40 percent, higher to 1,888.30.   Down Under, the S&P/ASX 200 see-sawed between gains and losses  in morning trade before closing up 66.54 points, or 1.37 percent, at 4,910, with the energy sector gaining 4.45 percent.   Oil prices extended gains during Asian trading hours with the  global benchmark Brent up 4.13 percent at $34.77 a barrel and U.S. crude  futures were up by 4.42 percent at $30.74.Overnight, Brent tacked on 2.07 percent gains while U.S. futures  were up 1.09 percent on thin volume trade as it was a public  holiday stateside and trading closed early. The gains were made on the back of news that ministers from Saudi  Arabia, Russia, Qatar and Venezuela would hold a previously  unpublicized meeting in Doha this week, which led to speculations  of a possible global output deal. But skepticism dominates among market watchers, after talk of  possible production cuts from both OPEC and non-OPEC players over  recent weeks have come to naught. Some experts, however, believe that the extent of damage done by  low oil prices will be difficult to unwind even if prices increase further.Peter Esho, chief market analyst at Invast, told CNBC, "I think  the extent of declines have been very, very significant and  what's happening is Brent's been bouncing off a very depressed  level."He added that he couldn't see Brent break out of a downward trend  even if there was another 10 to 15 percent appreciation. "It's  still a downward trend," he said.   Energy plays across the region were mostly higher  with Santos gaining 5.90 percent, Oil Search up by  5.77 percent, Inpex up by 2.24 percent, and S-Oil adding 4.31 percent. Hong Kong-listed shares of CNOOC, Petrochina, and Sinopec were up between 2.51 and 6.42 percent while mainland shares of China Oilfield finished up by 2.66 percent.   Shares in Japanese telecommunication and internet  giant Softbank surged 15.91 percent after the company  announced a share buy-back amounting to as much as 500 billion  yen ($4.4 billion) or 14.2 percent of its own shares.  Toshiba shares closed up 8.17 percent after reports  said the electronics maker was not considering withdrawing from  personal computer (PC)  production and selling its Hangzhou  factory in China. Earlier,  the Sankei newspaper in Japan had said the  company was planning to pull out of PCs as it restructured its  business following a massive accounting scandal.   Major Japanese exporters such as Toyota, Nissan, Honda, and Sony finished mixed, from down 0.22 percent to up 1.49 percent. The dollar-yen pair, which fell as low as the 111-mark  last week, was flat at 114.52 in the afternoon. A  stronger yen is usually a negative for exporters because it decreases their overseas profits when the cash is converted to  the local currency.   Down Under, resources stocks were up on the back of price gains  in base metals including copper and iron ore. Iron ore futures in  China, traded on the Dalian Commodity Exchange, were up 0.6 percent  on Tuesday at midday, while the spot benchmark, compiled by the  Steel Index, was up 5.6 percent at $45.60 a tonne on Monday.  Big miners including Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton finished up 2.32 and 3.82 percent respectively, while iron ore producer Fortescue  gained 9.97 percent.  Gold miners, however, took a hit, with Newcrest sliding 5.61 percent  but Alacer Gold retraced losses of  over 1 percent to finish 1.12 percent as spot gold slid 1.27 percent to $1,194 an ounce. Overnight, U.S. markets were closed for the President's Day  public holiday.   — Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.
