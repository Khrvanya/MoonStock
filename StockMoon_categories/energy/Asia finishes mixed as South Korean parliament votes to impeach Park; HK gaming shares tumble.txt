The Korean won strengthened from an earlier session low of 1,168.31 against the dollar before the news to around 1,164.26 after. "A quick resolution and introduction of new leadership offers  South Korea the best opportunity to move on from this political  crisis and renew focus on the key issue facing the  country — the urgent need to revamp the now stagnating  chaebol-dominated economic model," said Liam Martin of FTI  Consulting in a Wednesday note.   Martin noted an impeachment vote could take up to 180 days of review by the  Constitutional Court before new elections were called, which suggested  continued uncertainty for South Korean politics in the near  future.   Japan's  finished up 230.90 points,  or 1.23 percent, at 18,996.37, notching four consecutive sessions  of gains. The Topix index added 12.67 points, or 0.84 percent, to 1,525.36. Australia's ASX  200 advanced 16.98 points, or 0.31 percent, to 5,560.62, supported by a 1.09 percent  gain in the energy sector and a 0.98 percent uptick in the  heavily-weighted financial sector.   Chinese mainland shares finished mixed, with the  composite closing up 16.69 points, or 0.52 percent, at 3,232.06 and the Shenzhen composite finished down 7.36 points, or 0.35 percent, at 2,070.  In Hong Kong, the  fell 0.56 percent, as gaming  shares saw sharp losses following reports of Beijing taking aim at the  Macau gaming industry in a bid to halt capital outflows.  The South China Morning Post reported Macau was planning to  enforce a withdrawal limit for China UnionPay ATM card holders  from 10,000 to 5,000 Macanese patacas ($626), which was  expected to take effect from Saturday. This, the Post reported,  followed the discovery that as much as 10 billion patacas in  China UnionPay ATM withdrawals were made in one month  alone.  The Monetary Authority of Macau told CNBC it would issue a  statement later on Friday to clarify  matters. Separately, China UnionPay, said in a statement,  initially cited by Reuters, that it had not changed its policy on  overseas withdrawal limits for mainland-issued cards, which were  set at 10,000 yuan ($1,449) a  day.   Shares of Wynn Macau tumbled 7.52 percent, Sands China was lower by 8.13 percent, Galaxy Entertainment fell 7.30 percent, SJM Holdings was down 6.65 percent  and Melco International Development sank 9.74 percent.   Australia's Crown Resorts fell 5.32 percent.   The CEO of MGM International, Jim Murren, told CNBC's "Mad  Money" the control the Chinese government placed were  "consistent with the kinds of controls they have put into place  in the past."  "I know there's a lot of chatter about this today. I don't want  to minimize the significance. It will reduce some gaming revenue.  But the long term play in Macau is an extremely positive story  and we're looking forward to opening up a very, very  entertainment laden new resort in Cotai next year," he  said.   The European Central Bank (ECB) surprised markets on  Thursday by announcing it would extend its massive  bond-buying program from April 2017, but would reduce the size of  the monthly purchases. The ECB currently purchases assets worth  80 billion euros ($86 billion) a month, in a program that was due  to end in March 2017.While the central bank was set to extend  that program until at least December of next year, ECB  chief Mario Draghi said it would purchase assets  worth 60 billion euros monthly from April.   The euro fell against the dollar from levels over  $1.08 before the announcement to around $1.06 on Friday afternoon  Asia time.  Some analysts said the market was reading Draghi's announcement  as a "calibration" rather than "tapering."  "In his words, tapering is reducing to zero purchases," said  David de Garis, a director of fixed income, currencies and  commodities at National Australia Bank. "Perhaps the euro's  reaction was as much about Draghi's characterization of the  economic outlook."While the bank's statement noted that incoming data pointed to a  continuing growth trend in the fourth quarter, it noted that  "economic growth in the euro area is expected to be dampened by a  sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms and  remaining balance sheet adjustments in a number of  sectors."  In the broader currency market, the dollar remained relatively strong against a  basket of currencies, trading at 101.14 on Friday afternoon in  Asia. The yen traded at 114.39 against the  greenback, while the Australian dollar was at  $0.7465.

During Asian hours on Friday, U.S. crude added 0.57 percent to $51.13, after gaining 2.2 percent in the overnight session, while global  benchmark Brent gained 0.2 percent to $54.00, after finishing up 1.7 percent on Thursday.
