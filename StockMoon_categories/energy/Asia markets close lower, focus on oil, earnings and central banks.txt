  Asia markets closed mostly lower on Tuesday, weighed by declines  in the energy sector as oil prices continued to tumble. Japan's  lost 114.55 points, or 0.64 percent, to close down  at 17,750.68, while South Korea's Kospi slipped 18.22 points, or 0.95 percent,  to 1,906.60.   Down Under, the ASX 200 fell 50.28 points, or 1 percent, to  4,993.30, extending declines after the  Reserve Bank of  Australia's (RBA) decision to keep interest rates on  hold at a record low of 2 percent. The energy sector saw the  biggest loss, slipping 3.24 percent, following extended losses in  oil prices.   Angus Nicholson, market analyst at spreadbetter IG, wrote in an  afternoon note that equities sold-off despite prospects of  further rate cuts providing greater stimulus. "If we had two more  rate cuts by the RBA and inflation held at 1.7 percent, Australia  would have negative interest rates," he wrote.  Nicholson added, "This provides no incentive to put one's money  in bank deposits, and provides a strong incentive to seek out  low-volatility, high-yielding stocks."  Chinese markets bucked the broad trend and were mostly in  positive territory, with the  closing up 61.59 points, or 2.29 percent, at 2,750.44, after two consecutive sessions of declines. The  smaller Shenzhen composite finished 57.18 points, or 3.42 percent, higher at 1,729.08. But Hong Kong's  followed much of  the rest of Asia to close down 148.66 points, or 0.76 percent, at 19,446.84.  Oil prices extended their overnight tumble as the optimism over a  possible deal between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to reduce oversupply  faded. Last week, expectations of a possible Russia-Saudi deal  saw oil prices gain over 10 percent. Prices remain at multi-year  lows.   In Asian trading hours, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell 1.74  percent to $31.07, after declining 5.95 percent overnight.  Globally traded Brent April crude futures were down 1.61 percent at  $33.69 a barrel, following losses of 4.9 percent in U.S.  hours.   Energy plays across the region were mostly down, with Santos losing 4.26  percent, Oil  Search down 2.75 percent and Woodside Petroleum lower by 3.26 percent.

Elsewhere, resource stocks in Australia finished mostly down,  with Rio  Tinto and BHP Billiton falling 3.67 and 2.16 percent,  respectively. Sandfire Resources retraced early gains of as much  as 2.59 percent to decline by 1 percent.   The Aussie  dollar-U.S. dollar pair lost 0.63 percent, trading at  0.7065 as the Reserve  Bank of Australia (RBA) left interest rates unchanged,  in line with expectations, after meeting for the first time in  2016.  In a statement, the bank said monetary policy needs to be  accomodative as low commodity prices have led to expansion of  non-mining sectors in the Australian economy and contraction of  spending in mining investment.   Paul Bloxham, chief economist for Australia and New Zealand at  HSBC, told CNBC's "Street Signs" that the tone in the RBA statement was  very similar to its previous commentary.   "The added bit was a reference to the fact that we've seen  financial turmoil recently and an open-ended statement saying  we'll have to see whether that means there's going to be weaker  global or domestic demand," he said.  Bloxham added, "They've still got scope to be able to cut  interest rates because inflation is still very low, but they  don't seem to have any appetite to do that as yet. And that's  largely because the labor market's been improving and business  conditions have been holding up. If those things weaken, then  they may need to cut rates a bit further but for now they're  happy to sit still."   In Japan, financial plays traded mixed after earlier halting  their losing streak since Friday, when the Bank of Japan surprised markets with  a negative interest rate policy move. Negative rates could affect  their profit levels. Mitsubishi UFJ, which traded between down 1.87 percent  and up 1.60 percent earlier, trimmed gains to close 0.40 percent  higher.

At the same time, reports said Shuma Uchino, the chief financial officer of one Japan's largest  trading houses,  Mitsubishi Corporation, said he does not expect a major recovery in resource prices for  the next two to three years.   Shares of Mitsubishi Electric closed up 4.67 percent, while Mitsubishi Corp. shares were down 2.45 percent. Japanese video game-maker Nintendo announced its third fiscal quarter earnings after market close with net profit for the period falling 36 percent on-year to 29.1 billion yen ($241.3 million), down from 45.2 billion, due to a lack of high-profile game titles that affected sales.
