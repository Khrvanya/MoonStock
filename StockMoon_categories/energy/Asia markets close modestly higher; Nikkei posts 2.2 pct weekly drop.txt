Major Asian markets closed  modestly higher Friday after wavering between gains and losses, although major indexes in Australia and Japan posted  weekly losses.   In Japan, the benchmark  closed up 59.81 points, or 0.36  percent, at 16,545.82 on Friday, posting a weekly decline of  2.21 percent. The Topix added 4.88 points, or 0.38 percent, to  1,295.67.   The Japanese  yen briefly strengthened as high as 99.84 against the  dollar, before retreating to levels near 100.21 in the afternoon.  On Thursday, the yen climbed as high as 99.62 during Asian  hours.   But the currency's relative weakness compared with Thursday's  session helped support shares of major exporters, with Toyota closing up 2.14  percent, Honda  adding 3.53 percent and Mazda gaining 2.32 percent.   Across the Korean Strait, the Kospi closed near flat at 2,056.24, posting a 0.28 percent weekly gain.   In Australia, the benchmark ASX 200 gained 18.86 points, or 0.34 percent, to  5,526.68, with all but one sector finishing up. The energy  sub-index was down 0.57 percent. For the week, the index lost  nearly 0.1 percent.    In Hong Kong, the  was down 0.22 percent in late-afternoon  trading.   Chinese mainland markets closed up, with the  composite adding 4.61  points, or 0.15 percent, to 3,108.72, while the Shenzhen composite  gained 2.47 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,044.69.   The modestly positive session in Asia followed a higher finish  stateside amid rising oil prices. Oil received a boost in  sentiment on further news suggesting OPEC and other major exporters  could consider a deal to tackle the global oversupply. That sent oil futures climbing more than 2 percent on Thursday.   "The [overnight] bounce in oil was helped along by further  jawboning from the former president of OPEC, Chakib Khelil, who  stated that an OPEC supply-freeze deal was on course because its  biggest members were already producing at record levels," said  Angus Nicholson, a market analyst at spreadbettor IG.   Khelil made his remarks during an interview with Bloomberg  Television earlier this week.   During late afternoon in Asia, however, oil prices retreated  modestly. U.S. crude futures slipped  slightly, down 0.06 percent to $48.19 a barrel, while global  benchmark Brent fell 0.49 percent to  $50.64.   In the currency market, the dollar climbed against a basket of currencies, trading at 94.411 as of 3:53 p.m. HK/SIN, after earlier slipping to a session low of 94.217. This was compared with levels near  94.468 on Thursday afternoon Asia time.   Kathy Lien, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK  Asset Management, said investors were not yet convinced of the  seriousness of the risk that the Fed might raise rates later this  year.   "The market clearly believes that [policymakers] need to see  consistently strong data to justify tightening this close to the  U.S. Presidential election," she said.    The Korean won  weakened sharply against the dollar, trading as low as 1120.60,  compared with its last close at 1107.13.  Major Australian banks initially sold off in early trade after  ratings agency Moody's on Friday morning said it revised the  rating outlooks of five Australian banks to negative from  stable. The banks with revised outlooks include the  country's so-called Big Four: ANZ, Commonwealth Bank of  Australia (CBA), National Australia Bank (NAB)  and Westpac.   But bank shares later mostly recovered, with CBA turning  positive, rising 0.45 percent. National Bank of  Australia shares also erased early losses of more than 1  percent to close up 0.11 percent.   "The outlook change for Australia's four major banks reflects  Moody's expectation of a more challenging operating environment  for banks in Australia for the remainder of 2016 and beyond,  which could lead to a deterioration in their profit growth and  asset quality, as well as increase in their sensitivity to  external shocks," said Moody's in a note.   The major banks have been under pressure this year due to rising  bad debts related to their exposure to the resources sectors,  which have suffered from a global slump in commodity  prices.   In company news, shares of Samsung Electronics climbed 2.13  percent, at 1,675,000 won. The smartphone giant's shares hit  an all-time closing high on Thursday,  giving it a market capitalization of 232 trillion won ($210  billion), as investors cheered the company's turnaround plans.  Shares of Singapore Telecommunications traded down 0.48 percent,  after the telco announced on Thursday it would acquire a stake in Thailand's  Intouch Holdings and boost its holding in India's Bharti  Telecom to take advantage of faster growth in emerging  markets.   Analysts said the impact of the acquisition in Thailand will have  minimal impact on the company's numbers. CIMB analysts said in a  note to clients that they expect Singtel's dividend policy will  likely stay unchanged.  — Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.
