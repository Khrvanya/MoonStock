  Asian markets closed mostly higher Friday, with Japan extending  gains, but some caution persisted after recent volatility.    Stephen Innes, a senior trader for Asia Pacific at OANDA was,  doubtful the relatively sanguine market sentiment would persist.     "Despite this glimmer of optimism that we are seeing leading up  to this weekend's G-20 summit, the likelihood of a coordinated  policy pact is doubtful. Instead, the big fear is that whatever  sliver of optimism investors currently have in an otherwise  dreary outlook will be further eroded after the summit. So we  could be in for some messy markets next week," he said.   G20 finance ministers and central bankers were gathering in  Shanghai for a summit that kicked off Friday to discuss global  economic growth concerns.   In Japan, the benchmark  ended up 0.30 percent, or 48.07  points, at 16,188.41, retracing gains of as much as 2.06 percent  earlier in the session. The index had tacked on 1.41 percent in  Thursday's session. The broader Topix closed up 0.29 percent, or 3.73 points,  at 1311.27.   Shares initially got a boost as the yen weakened, with the  dollar-yen pair  strengthening above the 113-handle, but the yen gave up some of  its gains during the session. The dollar was fetching 112.69 yen  at 14:40 SIN/HK. A weaker yen is a positive for shares of Japan's  exporters as it boost overseas earnings when they are translated  back into the home currency.   Exporters were mixed, with Toyota down 0.35 percent, while Sony added 0.17 percent.  Troubled Japanese electronics maker Sharp saw steep losses, with  its shares down 11.41 percent; on Thursday, its shares fell 14  percent. The sell-off started after Reuters and  the Nikkei reported Thursday that the company  accepted a 659 billion yen ($5.9 billion) takeover bid by  Taiwan's Foxconn. Since then, several media outlets reported the  Taiwanese manufacturer as saying that it would not sign the deal until Sharp  clarified terms in a new document over previously undisclosed contingent liabilities potentially worth more than $3 billion.   Shares of Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, were  down 1.66 percent.   Among other markets, Chinese markets were also higher, with the  up 0.95 percent, or 25.96 points, at 2767.21, retracing some of its  6.4 percent plunge in the previous session.

Bucking the trend, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 closed nearly flat at  4,879.96, down just 1.22 points, with the energy and mining  sectors down 0.93 and 0.77 percent, respectively. Miners  finished mostly lower, with Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Fortescue down between 2.56 and 3.19  percent.   Energy remained a focus for the markets. Oil prices retreated  during Asian hours, with the U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI)  crude down 0.21 percent at $33.00 at 14:50 SIN/HK time, after  settling up 2.86 percent overnight. Global benchmark Brent futures were down 0.48  percent at $35.12 a barrel, following gains of 2.6 percent in  U.S. hours.   David de Garis, a director and senior economist for fixed income,  currencies and commodities at the National Australia Bank, wrote  in a morning note that oil's overnight gains were "on seemingly  little fundamental news."Overnight, OPEC members and Russia reportedly confirmed a  meeting in March to discuss capping crude production at January  levels. Earlier in the week, Saudi Arabia dashed hopes of oil  production cuts to reduce the global supply glut. But analysts are  skeptical that a freeze, without output cuts, will have much  impact.  Energy shares were mixed. In Japan, Inpex added 0.14 percent, but  in Australia, Woodside dropped 3.06 percent and Oil Search fell  0.75 percent. Hong Kong-listed Sinopec gained 5.73 percent,  In Singapore, Noble Group shares were up 5.97 percent after  falling over 10 percent in total on Wednesday and Thursday,  following the company's profit warning after the market close  Tuesday.

After the profit warning, ratings agency Moody's downgraded Noble to Ba3 from  Ba1 in the junk category. The agency had cut Noble's  investment grade rating in December.  One of Australia's largest supermarket chains, Woolworths, retraced losses of as  much as 2.7 percent to finish up 2.06 percent. The company  reported its earnings before market open. Reports said the  company's fiscal first-half net income fell 33 percent, while  first-half profit after tax was A$925.8 million, down from the  $1.3 billion reported a year earlier.   Japan inflation data, released Friday, spurred some fresh  concerns about the country's efforts to kickstart its economy. Japan's core consumer prices for  January remained unchanged on-year, in line with expectations,  and below the Bank of Japan's inflation target of 2 percent. Last  month, the central bank introduced negative interest rates in a  bid to spur economic growth.  "Today's Japanese CPI release underscores the need for further  action by the BOJ if they are determined about the 2 percent  inflation target," Angus Nicholson, a market analyst at IG, wrote  in an afternoon note, adding while energy prices were primarily  responsible, the number also underscored lack of inflationary  pressure in other parts of the economy.   "An increase in the BOJ's asset purchases program seems to be  what the market is demanding. But the BOJ's QQE [Qualitative and  Quantitative Easing] policy is at such extreme levels that they  are beginning to run out of government bonds to buy," added  Nicholson.   Stateside, the  closed up 1.29  percent, the S&P 500 gained 1.13 percent and  the  added 0.87 percent.  Companies expected to announce earnings include Nine  Entertainment, AirAsia and Sun. — Reuters contributed to this  report. — Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.
