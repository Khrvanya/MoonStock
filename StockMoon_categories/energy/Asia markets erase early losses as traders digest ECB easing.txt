  Asia markets reversed early losses to finish mostly higher on  Friday, as traders digested fresh easing from the European  Central Bank (ECB) overnight.   The Japanese benchmark  erased losses to close up 86.52 points,  or 0.51 percent, at 16,938.87. The index was still down 0.44 percent for  the week. Across the Korean Strait, the Kospi ended higher by 2.08 points, or  0.11 percent from Thursday's close, at 1,971.41. Hong Kong's  closed up 215.18 points, or 1.08 percent, at 20,199.60.   Down Under, the S&P/ASX 200 closed up 16.32 points, or 0.32 percent, at 5,166.40, registering a 1.5 percent gain for the week. Chinese markets finished mixed, with the  up 4.44 points, or 0.16 percent, at 2,809.17. The Shenzhen  composite closed down 3.73 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,685.23.   Overnight, the ECB delivered a surprise package of measures to  kick start Europe's economy by cutting its main interest rates and expanding its  massive bond-buying program.After the post-decision press conference Thursday, markets reacted negatively to the easing measures,  strengthening the euro and pushing stocks down. Initially, Asian markets tracked that mood, but sentiment later turned and many erased losses.    Angus Nicholson, a market analyst at IG, wrote in an afternoon  note, "Despite a negative open to the Asian session, cash markets  and U.S. and European futures markets have bounced into positive  territory in the latter half of the session.""Debt markets were far more upbeat on the ECB announcement and it  appears that the more erratic equities market is now following  the calmer lead of the bond market and moving higher," Nicholson  added. Margaret Yang, a market analyst from CMC Markets Singapore, attributed the initial weakness to the ECB decision to a lack of confidence in the economic outlook and in the central bank's ability to raise inflation.   "Plus, the ECB's stimulus was very much anticipated and  priced by the market previously, therefore, any bits of surprises  could lead to rising volatility," she added in a note Friday morning.  In the currency market, the euro came off the highs it touched  after the ECB's announcement. During Asian hours, the euro/dollar pair traded  at 1.1174 after rising as high as 1.1217 on Thursday after the  decision.  The Japanese yen remained near the 113 handle against the dollar in the second half of the Asian session. The  pair traded at 113.47. Exporters in Japan finished mixed, with shares of Toyota off 0.23 percent and Nissan lower by 0.32 percent, while Sony added 0.33 percent.  Usually, a stronger yen is a negative for exporters as it reduces  their overseas profits when converted into local currency.   Mining stocks in Australia closed mixed, with major miners  Rio Tinto off 0.36 percent and BHP  Billiton lower by 0.51 percent. Shares of South32 finished up 3.5 percent. Commodity prices retreated  from their rally earlier in the week. For example, this week,  iron ore hit its highest point for the year at $63.30 a tonne;  Friday morning, prices retreated to $57.40 a tonne.   BNP Paribas said in a note Friday that commodities, in particular  iron ore, had been a key driver for the Australian market this  week in the absence of major data.  "The accelerated rally at the beginning of the week appears to  have come from short-covering after the China National Party  Congress at the weekend (5-6 March)," the note said, questioning  if this move will be long lasting. "It cannot be ignored,  especially given the knock on impact it is having on [foreign  exchange] and rates markets."   The rally in commodities helped to strengthen the Australian dollar, which  was up at $0.75 as of 2:35 p.m. HK/SIN time, off  lows of just under $0.71 last month.  The Chinese yuan strengthened against the dollar, with the   pair down 0.21 percent at 6.4935 in the afternoon. Before market  open, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the yuan  mid-point fix at 6.4905, its strongest level in 2016, compared  with Thursday's fix of 6.5127.   Oil prices reversed course, with the global  benchmark Brent up 1.45 percent at $40.63 in late afternoon, after settling  down 2.5 percent overnight. U.S. crude futures were up 1.98 percent at $38.59, after falling 45 cents to finish at $37.84 a barrel on Thursday. Energy plays in Asia were mixed, with Santos closing up 0.78 percent, Oil Search lower by 1.91 percent and Inpex lower by 1 percent. Chinese mainland oil plays reversed losses to close mostly up, with Sinopec adding 0.17 percent.   Yesterday, reports said an OPEC meeting aimed at freezing  output appeared unlikely to go ahead without Iran's  participation, which sent oil prices lower during U.S. hours.   Stateside, U.S. indexes closed mixed, with the  flat, the S&P 500 flat and the  down 0.26 percent.  — Reuters contributed to this  report.  — Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.
