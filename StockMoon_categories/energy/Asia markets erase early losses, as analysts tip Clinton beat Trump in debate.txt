  Asia markets retraced much of their earlier losses to trade  mostly higher on Tuesday, following the conclusion of the first U.S.  presidential debate.   Some analysts attributed the turnaround in most Asian stocks to a  market perception that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won the  debate against Republican candidate Donald Trump, which was held late Monday U.S. time.   "Leading into the debate, traders were long volatility,  anticipating a Trump victory and risk-off session," said Matt  Simpson, senior market analyst at spreadbettor ThinkMarkets. "But  as soon as traders caught a whiff of Donald's defeat, short bets  were closed and risk sentiment improved."   CMC Markets' chief market strategist, Michael McCarthy, said the  market was "searching for the least worse option between the two  U.S. candidates."   "One is a known market bad, the other an unknown bad. Any ramping  up of populist rhetoric would likely rattle investors. Any  perception that the outsider candidate won the debate could bring  a market rout," said McCarthy.   Australia's ASX  200 closed down 25.52 points, or 0.47 percent, at 5,405.90,  after paring some of its 1 percent losses from early trade. The  heavily-weighted financial sector closed down 0.79 percent, while  the energy sector was lower by 0.75 percent.

Japan's  closed up 139.37 points, or 0.84 percent, to  16,683.93, erasing a nearly 1.3 percent loss in early trade.  Stocks were under pressure earlier due to an overnight rise in  the yen.   The Japanese  yen also erased early strength. After the dollar/yen  pair fell as low as 100.07, compared with around 100.85 on Monday  afternoon local time, the pair recovered to 100.91 as of 2:19  p.m. HK/SIN.  Exporters in Japan mostly reversed losses to close higher, with  Toyota up  1.64 percent, Nissan off 0.73 percent, Sony down 0.09 and Fujitsu up 0.09 percent.   The yen had climbed after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told business  leaders in Osaka that the central bank was prepared to use every  policy tool available to achieve its 2 percent inflation target,  including cutting short-term interest rates further into negative  territory.   "While underscoring his determination to use all possible policy  means to achieve inflation goals, [Kuroda] did nothing to assuage  deepening market conviction that the policy instruments and  settings announced last week won't do it," Ray Attrill, global  co-head of foreign exchange strategy at the National Australia  Bank, said in a morning note.   In the broader currency market, the dollar index, which tracks the  greenback against a basket of currencies, traded at 95.372,  compared with its last close at 95.297, and down from levels above 96.00 in the previous  week.
