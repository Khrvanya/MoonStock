  Markets in Asia dropped sharply on Friday, with the Nikkei  tumbling, after a sell-off on Wall Street as oil remained  volatile and concerns about how central banks' easing measures  will affect banks' earnings persisted.   "The idea that central banks are now fully targeting the interest  rate structure and putting a gun to domestic banks heads in a  fight to stoke credit growth is in no way an equity friendly  story," wrote Chris Weston, chief market strategist at  spreadbetter IG, in a morning note. The Bank of Japan blindsided  markets on January 29 by cutting its benchmark rate into negative  territory in a move that's sparked concerns over banks'  earnings.   Japan's , which reopened after a public holiday on Thursday,  dropped 760.78 points, or 4.84 percent, to 14,952.61, falling for  seven of the past eight sessions to its lowest close since  October, 2014. The Nikkei 225 has been on a downward spiral in  recent days, as the yen rapidly strengthened against the dollar,  with the index ending down more than 11 percent for the week.  "The heightened volatility in financial markets could adversely  impact the real economy. It may dampen business confidence,  disincentivizing Japanese companies from investing and raising  wages. It may also discourage banks from lending and expanding  the balance sheets," DBS said in a note Friday. "If the financial  market jitters spread and business plans are postponed broadly  elsewhere, Japan's exports would also be depressed."  During Asian trade, the dollar-yen pair was at 112.50, up from a session low of  111.91; it had traded as low as 110.98 on Thursday, compared with  levels over 120 at the beginning of the month. The yen has risen  sharply since the BOJ's move to a negative interest rate policy. A strong  yen is a negative for export stocks as it dampens their overseas  profits when converted into local currency. That's prompting some analysts to revise their forecasts for the  dollar-yen pair. Barclays said in a note Friday that it believes  the yen had been "excessively" undervalued compared with the  country's economic fundamentals and that's now unwinding. It  expects the dollar-yen pair to fall as low as 100 by end of the  first quarter and 95 by year end. Among Japanese exporters, Toyota, Nissan and Sharp dropped 6.81, 5.82, and  10.32 percent, respectively.   In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 fell 55.77 points, or 1.16 percent,  to 4,765.30, off by more than 2 percent for the week. The  financial sector weighed on the index, dropping 1.58 percent on  Friday.   In South Korea, the Kospi was down 26.26 points, or 1.41 percent, at 1,835.28, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slipped 226.22 points, or 1.22 percent, to 18,319.58 on its second  day of trade this week. Both the Korean and Hong Kong markets  were closed from Monday through Wednesday for the Lunar New Year  holidays.     Mainland Chinese markets and Taiwan will resume trade next week.  Asia's banks and financial stocks remained under pressure,  following drops in their Europe and the U.S. counterparts as concerns mounted over their potential performance in a  low-growth and low-interest rate environment.  The so-called Big Four banks Down Under - ANZ, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac, and NAB - closed down between 1.31 and 2.54 percent. Japanese banks saw steep losses, with Mitsubishi UFJ down 2.23 percent, SMFG lower by 4.06 percent,  Mizuho Financial  shedding 3.66 percent and Nomura falling 9.21 percent.   South Korean brokerages were down between 0.70 and 5.03 percent;  Samsung  Securities fell 3.50 percent, while Daewoo  Securities was down 3.20 percent.   Overnight, European banking equities extended recent declines,  pushing the  European bank index down 6.3 percent by  the end of trade. Concerns over interest rates' effects on banks got an additional fillip when Sweden's central bank yesterday slashed its deposit rates from negative-35 basis points to negative-50 basis  points. Oil prices remained volatile, registering gains in Asian trade after a drop overnight on the back of a build-up in global inventories.   U.S. crude retraced losses of 4.5 percent overnight to trade up 4.81 percent in Asian hours at $27.47 a barrel. Global benchmark Brent was up 4.36 percent at $31.37 a barrel.Energy plays were mixed, with shares of Santos rising 3.61 percent and Woodside slipping 0.26 percent, while Japan's Inpex fell 6.36 percent and Japan Petroleum slid 3.94 percent. Hong Kong-listed shares of CNOOC, Petrochina and Sinopec closed up between 0.40 and 0.67 percent.   The Wall Street Journal reported that according to UAE's energy  minister, OPEC was ready to cooperate on production cuts, But  skepticism in the market remained; in recent weeks both Russia  and Venezuela have called for OPEC and other major oil producers  to cut output and Iran has said it is ready to cooperate on  output, all apparently without making any headway.    Shares of steelmaker Bluescope closed up 14.16 percent, after a profit upgrade.  The steelmaker projected earnings for the first half of fiscal  2016 would be A$230 million, up from an earlier projection of  about A$180 million. Reports said the company cited accelerated  cost-cutting, better margins and rising demand in Australia as  reasons for the profit upgrade.  Other resources plays Down Under closed mostly down, with big  producers Rio  Tinto and BHP  Billiton falling 1.27 and 0.98 percent respectively. Iron  ore producer Fortescue was down 4.71 percent.    Rio Tinto reported annual losses after Thursday's market close  and scrapped its progressive dividend policy, broadly in line  with market expectations, citing worsening global economic  conditions and downturn in commodity prices. Rio Tinto reported a  net loss of $866 million for 2015, compared with a $6.53 billion  profit the previous year.  The price of  gold was off 0.84 percent at $1,236.10 an ounce during Asian  hours after jumping more than 5 percent in overnight trade to a  one-year high. The precious metal is usually considered a  safe-haven investment at times of market volatility.    Mark Matthews from Bank Julius Baer said in a note that at any  moment a rally in risk appetite could send the precious metal back down.  But Matthews added, "Few market participants think that rally, when it comes, will be sustainable, and after that, markets will  remain in a southerly direction for the next few months."  "In which case, there is more room for gold (and its proxies) to  move higher," added Matthews.   Gold miners ended mostly up. Shares of Evolution Mining added 5.05 percent,  Kingsgate soared  43.75 percent and Alacer Gold tacked on 3.77 percent. Newcrest gave up morning gains to close down 0.12 percent.   Major indexes in the U.S. finished lower, with the  closing 254.56 points, or 1.6  percent,  lower at 15,660.18. The S&P 500 slipped 22.78  points, or 1.23 percent, to 1,829.08 and the  was down 16.76  points, or 0.39 percent, at 4,266.84.
