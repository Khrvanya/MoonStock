Jim Lowell, CIO at Adviser Investments, told CNBC's "The Rundown" that the tax reform plan at the moment is more theoretical than practical. He pointed out that tax reforms also tend to have intended and unintended consequences that are both positive and negative. "There'll be plenty of time to digest the plan, if it actually does turn into some mode of enactment," Lowell said. "There'll also be plenty of time to figure out how to maneuver as the revisions go forward. But I would definitely advise investors to not make any investment move today based on the fact that they don't know how this tax reform plan is going to play out."
