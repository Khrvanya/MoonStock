Markets in Asia finished mixed on Tuesday, as South Korea's shares slipped after data showed economic growth slowed in the third quarter.The Kospi index closed down 10.57 points, or 0.52 percent, at 2,037.17, while the Korean won slipped from levels near 1132.80 to a low of 1139.40 against the dollar after the data was released. As of 3:24 p.m. HK/SIN, the dollar/won pair traded lower at 1133.47, after the won saw renewed strength in the afternoon session, reaching a session high of 1132.51. Bank of Korea data showed South Korea's third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.7 percent on-quarter, beating a Reuters poll forecast for a 0.6 percent uptick. But on an yearly basis, GDP grew by 2.7 percent, slower than the second quarter's 3.3 percent rise. "The moderation [in GDP] was broadly expected, which was presaged by the sequential slowdown in industrial production in the first two months of the quarter," said Eugenia Victorino, Asia economist at ANZ, in a note. During the quarter, South Korea saw a massive workers' strike at Hyundai Motor, as well as the collapse of container shipper Hanjin Shipping, which filed for court receivership on August 31.In September, electronics giant Samsung was forced to recall shipments of its new Galaxy Note 7 handsets amid reports of the devices catching fire. In October, Samsung permanently halted production of the devices and announced it expected a more than $5 billion profit hit spread over second half of 2016 and first quarter of 2017. Victorino said there was still space for the Bank of Korea to deliver another rate cut in the January-March quarter of 2017.   The rest of Asian markets finished mixed on Tuesday after a  stronger dollar and falling oil prices overnight tapered U.S. gains.    Japan's  closed up 130.83 points, or 0.76 percent, at 17,365.25, reaching levels not seen since April. The Topix  index gained 9.71 points, or 0.71 percent, to 1,377.32. In Hong Kong, the  trimmed early declines to trade nearly flat at  23,617.41 as of 3:29 p.m. HK/SIN. Chinese mainland markets closed modestly higher, with  the  composite up 3.83 points, or 0.12 percent, at 3,132.08, while the  Shenzhen composite gained 7.53 points, or 0.36 percent, to 2,077.74.   In Australia, the ASX 200 index climbed 34.31  points, or 0.63 percent, to 5,442.80, with most sectors rising.  The heavily-weighted financial sector closed up 0.74 percent,  with the country's so-called Big Four banks gaining.  Shares of ANZ gained 0.67 percent, Commonwealth Bank of Australia was 0.75 percent  higher, Westpac rose 1.08 percent and  the National Australia Bank added 0.62  percent.   The  traded at 98.75 against a basket of currencies on  Tuesday afternoon during Asian hours, off an earlier session high  of 98.83, climbing from levels below 98.00 last week.   Analysts said rising U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike  expectations supported the dollar during U.S. hours; dollar  strength pushed other currency majors lower during Asian  hours.   The yen retreated to the 104 handle, trading at 104.43  against the dollar as of 3:32 p.m. HK/SIN, compared with levels  as high as 103.20 late last week.   Analysts at Singapore's DBS Bank said in a morning note the  dollar/yen pair was looking to surpass the "ceiling of its  103.14-104.62 range established since 11 October." The analysts  said if successful, the pair could move higher toward the 107  handle.   The relative weakness in the yen likely helped major Japanese  exporters rise. Shares of Toyota rose 1.43 percent, Nissan was  up 1.28 percent and Mazda Motor gained 2.93 percent. Panasonic  shares retraced some of their 0.7 percent early gain to close up 0.19 percent.   Japanese gaming giant Nintendo saw some reprieve from share price  declines, adding 2.98 percent to 24,685 yen a share following two  consecutive sessions of losses as investors appeared somewhat  unimpressed by the introduction of its new gaming  console, Nintendo Switch, last week.   Japan's Kyushu Railway made its trading debut on  the stock market, with Reuters reporting the shares were  initially untraded after the market open on a glut of buy orders.  Kyushu Railway eventually opened at 3,100 yen a share, which was  19.23 percent higher than the initial public offering (IPO) price  of 2,600 yen, according to Reuters.  At market close, Kyushu Railway prices were at 2,990 yen a  share.   The Australian dollar fell as low as $0.7586, after climbing  to levels near $0.7640 in the Monday session. As of 3:36 p.m.  HK/SIN, the pair traded at $0.7625.   The drop in the Australian dollar may have followed declines in  commodity prices as the greenback strengthened. But the Aussie  recovered, likely as traders were turning their attention toward  inflation data due Wednesday.   Markets have little expectation that the Reserve Bank of  Australia (RBA) will cut interest rates again any time soon, Lee  Sue Ann, an analyst at UOB, said in a note Tuesday. "We believe it would take a very weak and disappointing  inflation number to push the RBA into easing yet further," she  said. "Barring an extremely low third-quarter Australian consumer  price index print, the currency pair is likely to stay supported around the 0.760-levels and may drift higher towards 0.770 in the  near term."  Oil prices advanced in late afternoon trade during Asian hours  after falling in the U.S. session amid renewed oversupply  concerns. U.S.  crude futures were up 0.36 percent at $50.70 as of 3:37  p.m. HK/SIN, after dropping 0.7 percent overnight and briefly  dipping below $50.   Global benchmark Brent was up  0.19 percent at $51.56, after finishing down 0.6 percent during  U.S. hours.   Reuters reported Britain's Buzzard oilfield in the North Sea,  which pumps about 180,000 barrels a day, was set to restart on  Tuesday or Wednesday, following a month-long planned maintenance  outage.   Reuters also reported that Iraq's oil minister  Jabar Ali al-Luaibi said OPEC's  second-largest producer wanted an exemption from output curbs as  it needed more money to fight Islamic State militants.  Elsewhere, shares of South Korean memory chip maker SK  Hynix climbed 2.24 percent, after the company announced  third quarter earnings results for fiscal 2016. Operating profit  for the July-September quarter was at 726 billion won ($640.02  million), up 60 percent on-quarter, but down 48 percent on-year.  The number, however, beat a Thomson Reuters StarMine  SmartEstimate that predicted 672 billion won in operating  profit.   The company said shipments increased from new smartphone launches  and a better-than-expected demand for personal computers.   The  rose 77.32 points, or 0.43 percent, to close at  18,223.03. The S&P 500  index gained 10.17 points, or 0.47 percent, to end at  2,151.33, while the  composite advanced 52.42 points, or 1  percent, to 5,309.83.   — Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.
