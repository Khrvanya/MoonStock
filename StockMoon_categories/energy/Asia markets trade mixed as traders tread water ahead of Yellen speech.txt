Markets in Asia finished mixed on Wednesday, as traders remained in a wait-and-see mode ahead  of Federal  Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's speech at Jackson  Hole on Friday.   Japanese shares rose, with the  finishing up 99.94 points, or 0.61 percent, at 16,597.30, while across the Korean Strait, the Kospi closed down 6.17 points, or 0.3 percent, at 2,043.76. In Australia, the ASX 200 ended modestly higher, up by 7.92 points, or 0.14 percent, at 5,561.70. Hong  Kong's  was down 1.2 percent in late afternoon trade. Chinese mainland markets were  mixed; the  composite closed down 3.88 points, or 0.13 percent, at 3,085.82, while the  Shenzhen  composite added 6.22 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,030.28.   Analysts at Singapore's OCBC Bank said in a research note  that pinning down market sentiment was challenging in the current  environment. "Given the lack of major economic data  out of the U.S., the sideways movement may still dominate [equity  markets], especially with some anticipation that Janet Yellen's  speech on Friday at the Jackson Hole symposium may just offer us  some clues about the Fed's next steps," the OCBC analysts said.    On the energy front, oil prices remained volatile. On Wednesday during Asian hours, prices retreated with U.S. crude futures down 1.5 percent at $47.38 a barrel, after climbing 1.5 percent on  Tuesday. Global benchmark Brent slipped 1.24 percent to  $49.34, after gaining 1.6 percent overnight. Oil's gains on Tuesday followed a Reuters report that said Iran was sending positive  signals that it may support joint action to prop up the  oil market.   Iran, which is OPEC's third-largest producer, has boosted production  output since it returned to the international market this year  when Western sanctions were lifted.  But Tuesday gains in oil prices were later pared when data from the  American Petroleum Institute showed that U.S. crude inventories  rose by 4.5 million barrels in the previous week, compared with  analysts' expectations for a drawdown of 500,000 barrels, Reuters  reported.   Energy plays in the region were mixed, with Santos closing up 0.44 percent,  Woodside Petroleum  up 0.86 percent and Inpex down 0.17 percent. Oil Search shares also fell 1.63  percent.   In the currency market, the dollar index, which measures the greenback's performance against a  basket of currencies, edged higher to 94.646, compared with  levels near 94.398 Tuesday afternoon Asia time. Analysts pinned  the slight uptick in the dollar on better-than-expected U.S. home sales  data.  But Maybank analysts said in a note that the market's building  anticipation toward Yellen's Friday speech was "keeping the  dollar in sideway trades."   The Japanese yen  traded relatively weaker against the dollar at 100.35 as of 2:19  p.m. HK/SIN, compared with levels as high as 99.97 reached on  Tuesday afternoon local time.   Relative weakness in the yen spurred Japanese export stocks  higher, with Toyota shares gaining 2.05 percent, Nissan up 2.72 percent and Sony adding 2.15  percent.   In emerging market currencies, the South African rand fell  overnight amid political concerns, while the Mexican peso  stumbled after ratings agency S&P unexpectedly revised its credit outlook for  the country to negative.   Emerging Asian currencies traded relatively weaker against the  dollar on Wednesday, with the dollar/rupiah up 0.32 percent at  13,260, the dollar/ringgit up 0.32 percent at 4.03 and  the dollar/baht up 0.14 percent at 34.66.   Citibank strategists said in a Wednesday note that declines in  emerging-market currencies reflected "investors' readiness to  trim their now-overweight exposure to emerging markets ahead of  the Jackson Hole symposium."  But the Citibank strategists added that fears the Fed may signal  a more hawkish stance on Friday will "prove unfounded" and that  should, in turn, "allow EM duration and currencies room to renew  modest rallies."   In company news, Australian airline carrier Qantas said its earnings for  the 12 months ended June 30, 2016 were the best result in its  95-year history.   Qantas reported an underlying profit before tax of 1.53 billion  Australian dollars ($1.17 billion) for the period, up 57 percent  on-year. The company said its main divisions - including Qantas  Domestic, Qantas International, the Jetstar Group and Qantas  Loyalty - reported record results, as Qantas benefited from  ongoing restructuring efforts.   The company declared a final dividend of 7 cents per share, which  Reuters said was the first final dividend Qantas has announced  since 2008. Qantas also said it will carry out a share buyback of  up to A$366 million, which would likely help to boost its stock  price.   Qantas shares closed up 1.47 percent at A$3.45.   Elsewhere, Hong Kong-listed shares of China Vanke were down 1.19 percent, while the Shenzhen-listed shares closed down 2.87 percent. Ratings  agency S&P on Wednesday said it revised its outlook on Vanke  to negative from stable, while affirming its BBB+ long-term  rating.   S&P said the revision reflected the "increasing likelihood  that the tension among the key shareholders and the management  team could ultimately weaken the company's steady business  execution and good financial discipline."  The company has been embroiled in an ongoing, high-profile battle  for control.   Elsewhere, global commodity trader Glencore reported its  first-half numbers for the six months through June 30, with adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and  amortization falling 13 percent on-year to $4.02 billion.   Glencore said it was targeting to cut net debt to between $16.5  billion and $17.5 billion by the end of 2016 through asset  sales.   "We have already largely achieved our asset disposals target of  $4-5 billion with a diverse and material pool of asset sales'  processes also on-going. Our divestment strategy remains one of  maximising value for shareholders through identifying assets  where overall Glencore franchise positioning, optionality and  value is substantially preserved or even enhanced," said  Glencore's chief executive officer, Ivan Glasenberg, in a  statement.   Stateside, the  added 17.88 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,547.3.  The S&P 500 index gained 4.26  points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,186.9, while the  advanced 15.47 points,  or 0.3 percent, to 5,260.08.  — Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.
