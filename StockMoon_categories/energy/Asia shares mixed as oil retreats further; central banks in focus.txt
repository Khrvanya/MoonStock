"Expectations were growing prior that we could see something substantial, but what we got was an entirely balanced and appropriate response in our view." "The Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) policy assessment was similar to its special Economic Update just three weeks ago ... but the changes that were made were of the dovish ilk," Bagrie and Borkin said.
