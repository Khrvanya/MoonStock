Asian equities closed in the red on Tuesday after oil prices fell more than 5 percent overnight. Oil prices suffered a sharp decline during U.S. trading as  a result of a global supply glut. The Organization of the  Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) failed to reach an  agreement to reduce production levels when it met on  Friday.   Instead OPEC oil  ministers dropped any reference to the group's output ceiling  for the first time in decades. This highlighted disagreements  among members on how to accommodate Iranian oil supply in the  market once Western sanctions are lifted.

Analysts agree that overproduction by OPEC is hurting the U.S.  market and alternate sources of energy such as shale.
