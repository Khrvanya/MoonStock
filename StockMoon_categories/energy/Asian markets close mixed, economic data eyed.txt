Asian stocks lost much of their gains from the morning session to close mixed on Monday, as investors eye a host of economic data due this week. Last week, nonfarm payrolls data showed the U.S. economy created 211,000  jobs for November, beating market expectations, which sent Wall Street soaring. It is likely to  have been the final sign for the Federal Reserve that conditions  are right for a hike in interest rates in December.Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at  AMP Capital, said in a note that despite the solid jobs number  for November, the imminent Fed rate hike is expected to be  modest.   "The hike when it comes will be a sign of how the U.S. has  recovered since the GFC [global financial crisis]; and that  subsequent rate hikes will likely be gradual and tied to progress  in lifting inflation back towards the Fed's target."  Oil prices will remain in focus after U.S. crude futures once again dipped below  the $40-mark. In Asian trade, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI)  futures traded at 46 cents or 1.15 percent lower at $39.51.  The internationally traded Brent was down 20 cents or 0.47  percent at $42.80.

The Japanese market closed in positive territory as investors await the latest  update of third quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data, the  broadest measure of economic health, and machinery orders figures.   Many investors remain unconvinced that Japan is out of the  woods yet as recent economic data showed the economy has slipped  into a technical recession while domestic consumption has  fallen.   Reuters reported that Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said  on Monday there was no need for further stimulus of implementing  negative deposit rates - following in the footsteps of the  European Central Bank (ECB) - to spur borrowing. He said the  central bank's asset purchases program has already kept borrowing  costs low.

Large numbers of vehicles were recalled in  the U.S. and elsewhere due to faulty Takata-made airbags that  resulted in passenger injuries and some deaths.

Shares in gold producers were boosted after prices  soared last week to the $1,082-mark after the nonfarm payroll  data reaffirmed the market's belief for a December rate hike. In  Asian trade, spot gold traded $1,084 an ounce.   Evan Lucas, market strategist at spreadbetter IG, said, "Gold has  had an amazing week, up 2.65 percent. What's even more amazing  was the snap back on Friday after the NFP surging 2.25 percent,  which was in conjunction with the USD surge. It was a complete  market miss-match; the logical conclusion is short-covering of  the heavily short gold paper trade. The positioning in the US  bond market and USD suggest this move in Australia won't last  long."  Shares in Newcrest  was up 3 percent, Evolution Mining up 5 percent, and Alacer Gold seeing an  uptick of 1.5 percent.  — Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.
