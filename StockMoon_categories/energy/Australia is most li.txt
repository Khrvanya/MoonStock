LNGThe world's top supplier Qatar risks being dethroned as Australia expects to boost exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by 16 percent from 2018.  
In the nearest future, Australia will raise its LNG exports from 63.8 million to 74 million tonnes. Qatar, for instance, exported 77.6 million tonnes last year.
 
Such a huge increase in Australia's LNG exports could be explained by a higher production at the Gorgon project, operated by Chevron Corp, and the completion of three remaining LNG projects: Chevron's Wheatstone, Inpex Corp's Ichthys, and Royal Dutch Shell's Prelude.

These three projects will boost Australia's LNG export capacity by about 21 million tonnes, amounting to around 88 million tonnes.

Australia's Department of Industry, Innovation and Science declared in its quarterly commodities report that Japan, South Korea and China are prepared to acquire the extra output.
