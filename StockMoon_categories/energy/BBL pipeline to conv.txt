Natural GasThe transmission of gas from Great Britain to the Netherlands via the BBL pipeline is likely to start from autumn 2019. At present, the only way to transport gas is via the pipeline from the Netherlands to the UK.Nevertheless, technical changes occur at the compressor station at Anna Paulowna and the gas terminal at Bacton. BBL Company thinks there is demand for British gas exports in Europe, especially during the summer time.

Luuk Feenstra, Managing Director of BBL Company declared: "At the moment, in the summer months, more gas is being collectively produced in and supplied to the UK (via Norwegian pipelines, from the North Sea fields and in the form of LNG) than is being sold. Seasonal storage facilities in the UK have insufficient capacity to store this surplus gas, partly due to the decommissioning of the Rough storage, which used to be Britain's largest gas storage facility."

BBL representative further said that the Netherlands and Germany have much bigger storage capacity than the Great Britain and is therefore predicted that will be more demand for gas transfer capacity from the UK to the Netherlands in summer and in the opposite direction in winter. 

INEOS energy company closed the Forties pipeline recently. Its repair works are estimated at around PS20 million a day.
