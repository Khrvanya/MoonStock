Developed together with co-venture partners Petro Ventures Resources and Gas Plus International B.V., the MGD project is the first new offshore gas development project in the Romanian section of the Black Sea to be built after 1989.
 
The MGD project consists of 5 offshore production wells (1 subsea well at Doina field and 4 platform wells at Ana field), a subsea gas production system over the Doina well which will be connected through an 18 km pipeline with a new unmanned production platform located over Ana field.
 
A 126 km gas pipeline will link the Ana platform to the shore and to a new onshore gas treatment plant in Corbu commune, Constanta county, with a capacity of 1 billion cubic metres (BCM) per year representing 10% of Romania's consumption. The processed gas will be delivered into the National Transmission System operated by gas pipeline operator Transgaz.
