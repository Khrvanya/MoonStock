WindBelgian energy companies InControl and Otary have come to an accord with government ministers regarding offshore wind supports, opening the way for the construction of the trio of projects estimated at 770 megawatts.The wind farms will obtain a support of EUR79 per megawatt-hour for around 16 years, declared the government, saving EUR3.9 billion from the lifetime of the wind projects in comparison with actual offshore building projects.

Several government ministers earlier this year threatened to suspend the offshore licenses completely if a compromise decision was not established on price supports. Negotiations held to lessen former government support commitment have been continuing since that time.

InControl declared that it is now preparing to boost the development activities on the 224MW Northwester 2 wind farm before the financial close in 2018 and operations ahead of the end of 2020 year. At the same time, Otary has also achieved a business arrangement with the Belgian government for its 300MW Mermaid and 246MW Seastar offshore wind farms, which are planned to be constructed on identical timelines.

Northwester 2 has as partners the following firms:  TTR, Wagram and Colruyt. Among Otary shareholders are SRIW, Wallonia Offshore Wind, Socofe, Rent-A-Port Energy, Power@Sea, Aspiravi Offshore II, Elicio, Deme and Deme Concessions Wind and Z-Kracht.
