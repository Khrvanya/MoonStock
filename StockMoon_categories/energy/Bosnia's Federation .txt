RenewableBosnia's Federation government targets a 44% share of renewable energy in the entity's electricity mix in 2020, it said.The share of renewables in heating is planned to stand at 49% in 2020, while in the transport sector the target is set at 10%, the Federation government said in a statement last week.
 
The targets are part of an updated action plan for the use of renewable energy sources adopted by the Federation government on November 8, it said.
 
The Federation is one of two autonomous entities making up Bosnia and Herzegovina. The other one is the Serb Republic.
 
In 2016, Bosnia and Herzegovina achieved a 25.3% share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption, below the 36.7% median trajectory for 2015-2016, the Energy Community said in its annual implementation report 2017-2018 published last week.
 
By the end of 2017, the country registered 113 MW of small hydropower plants, 16 MW of solar PV and 1 MW of biogas. The renewable energy share in transport is lower than 1%, the Energy Community said.
