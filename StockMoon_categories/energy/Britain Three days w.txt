RenewableCoal neglected for three days in a row while generating electricity in Britain.UK National Grid specified that a newly registered record broke the last record of 55 hours which was set a few days ago.

It has been reported zero usage of coal in the period between Saturday and Tuesday. 

England, Scotland and Wales consumers used the electricity chiefly produced from wind and gas. It happened just a few days after the National Grid experienced its first two-day period without any fossil fuels to be included during power generation.

Official figures indicate that coal represented less than 7% in the power mix last year.

Britain managed not to use coal for power generation the whole day in April 2017, since the 19th century.

Even so, specialists notified that electricity produced by coal was widely replaced by gas, another fossil fuel, rather than renewable sources.

A representative of the Durham Energy Institute maintained that gas produced 40% of the UK's electricity and fuelled a broad number of domestic heating. 

The daily usage of gas was surpassed by wind on just two days last year, whilst whole range  of renewable energy sources - involving biomass, solar, wind and hydropower - beat fossil fuels for just 23 days of 2017.

Hannah Martin, a Greenpeace UK member, urged the government to considerably back such renewable energy sources as solar and wind power due to their environmental friendly character and cost efficiency.

On the same note she drew attention on offshore wind, being more popular and having a vast spread in the UK, generating clean energy, skilled jobs and reasonable bills.
