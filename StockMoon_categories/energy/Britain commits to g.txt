CO2British Prime Minister Theresa May set a goal for the nation to reach net zero carbon emissions within about 30 years - the 1st major economy in the world to set that kind of goal."This country led the world in innovation during the Industrial Revolution, and now we must lead the world to a cleaner, greener form of growth," May said. "Standing by is not an option. Reaching net zero by 2050 is an ambitious target but it is crucial that we achieve it to ensure we protect our planet for future generations."
 
The net zero carbon goal is a bipartisan issue that's expected to be approved by British Parliament. Doug Parr, chief scientist for Greenpeace U.K., said the plan is something Britain can be proud of, but said the target date should be moved forward.
