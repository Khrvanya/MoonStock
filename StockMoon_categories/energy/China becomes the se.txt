LNGChina will turn into the world's second-largest importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2017 behind Japan, as it surpasses South Korea.China's LNG imports will have increased by more than 50 percent in 2017 compared with the 2016 to around 38 million tonnes. The import-dependent nation and the first LNG importer Japan, and South Korea will have taken approximately 83.5 million tonnes and merely over 37 million tonnes by the end of the year, respectively.

Wang Wen, Beijing-based gas analyst with consultancy Wood Mackenzie declared: "We are expecting to see even higher surges in winter demand over the next three to four years as the Chinese government pushes more broadly its gas-for-coal drive."

China's rising LNG import demand comes after a consistent government gasification program that made millions of households shift from using coal for household heating this year to natural gas.

Japan, China and South Korea together account for 60 percent of global LNG demand.

The world's major LNG producers are Qatar, Australia and Malaysia, which jointly meet around 60 percent of global demand. U.S. exports are also increasing due to the shale oil and gas output growth in North America.
