SolarThe expansion of the Chinese solar energy led global renewable energy investments in 2017.According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), this hike surpassed such an emerging investment in Australia and Mexico and drop registered in Japan, the UK and Germany.

The investment attained a total of $333.5 billion (PS241.4bn) last year, up 3% from 2016 and only 7% short of the record figure of $360.3 billion (PS261 billion) hit in 2015.

Globally, solar investment was around $160.8 billion (PS117 billion), up 18% in comparison with the last year. Over 50 percent of this amount was spent by China with the aim to install approximately 53GW of PV capacity, up from 30GW in 2016.

Jon Moore, Chief Executive of BNEF, said: "The 2017 total is all the more remarkable when you consider that capital costs for the leading technology - solar - continue to fall sharply. Typical utility-scale PV systems were about 25% cheaper per megawatt last year than they were two years earlier."
