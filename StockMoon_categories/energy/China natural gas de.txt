Natural GasState-owned Sinopec expects China's natural gas demand to increase by 82% to 510 Bcm in 2030, from 280 Bcm in 2018, driven by continued industrial upgrading and urbanization.Gas demand growth will come mainly from city gas, industrial usage and gas-powered utilities. Demand is expected to exceed 300 Bcm in 2019, up by almost 10% year on year.
 
City gas demand is likely to experience rapid growth over the next 10-15 years, driven by consumption growth from heating and the public sector.
 
This growth will be supported by China's growing urbanization and urban gasification, which are expected to exceed 70% within the next decade, up from 59.7% and 50.9% at the end of 2018, respectively.
 
China's city gas demand was 92.5 Bcm in 2018, accounting for a third of the country's total natural gas demand, Sinopec's data showed.
