NuclearAccording to a plan released by the country's National Energy Administration (NEA), China will encourage the development of nuclear power this year. Five new nuclear power reactors are planned to become operational in 2018 and construction works will commence with further six to eight units.In its Energy Work Guidance Opinion for 2018, the NEA affirmed that China's installed nuclear generating capacity would be enhanced by 6 GWe overall this year with the start-up of the Sanmen 1 and Haiyang 1 AP1000s, the Taishan 1 EPR, the Tianwan 3 VVER-1000 and the Yangjiang 5 ACPR1000.
 
The plan also expects China to continue the implementation of important nuclear science and technology projects, build a sharing system for experimental platforms for nuclear power technology and equipment, hasten the establishment of major projects for small-scale reactors and actively support the comprehensive utilization of nuclear energy.
 
Under the latest Five-Year Plan, published in March 2016, China should have some 58 GWe of nuclear production capacity functional by 2020, up from the current capacity of almost 35 GWe. Additionally, a further 30 GWe of nuclear capacity will be under construction by 2020.
