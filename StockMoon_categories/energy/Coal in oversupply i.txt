CoalChairman of state-owned PGG, the country's biggest coal mining firm, Tomasz Rogala has said that increased coal imports to Poland have led to excess supplies in some segments of the market, Poland's PAP news agency reported.According to the company's forecasts, PGG will have extracted 30-31 million tonnes of coal by the end of the year.
 
The company holds more than 50 percent of Poland's coal market share.
 
Meanwhile, Slawomir Obidzinski, chief of Weglokoks, said the country is expected to import 17-18 million tonnes this year, compared to 13.3 million tonnes recorded in 2017, PAP said.
 
Obidzinski added that the excess supply of coal in Poland is down to an "oversupply hysteria".
 
"A message [circulating across the market] that there is not enough coal triggers heightened emotions [in consumers] - it is a convenient way to pressure customers to buy the available raw material for an increasingly higher price," he said.
 
A similar situation happened ahead of last year's heating season, Obidzinski added.
