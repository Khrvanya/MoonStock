  Surging U.S. crude supplies, and OPEC's forecast of sharply lower  demand for its output combined to drive oil futures sharply lower  Wednesday, raising the stakes for $50-a-barrel oil before the end  of the year.  Oil has cratered more than 42 percent from its June highs, as  increased U.S. oil production added to world supplies and global  demand slipped. West Texas  Intermediate futures sank another 4.4 percent Wednesday to a  fresh five-year low just shy of $61 per barrel, and Brent lost another 4 percent to $64.19  per barrel.

The bearish  report also showed a sharp build in U.S. gasoline stocks of 8.2  million barrels, meaning less oil will be required for fuel.  OPEC's loose alliance to hold down production showed some  fissures Wednesday, when Iranian President Hassan Rouhani  blamed falling oil prices on "treachery," in an apparent dig at  rival Saudi Arabia, according to news wires. Iranian officials,  at the cartel's meeting last month, spoke publicly in support of  the Saudi-led effort to hold production levels in the face of  falling prices, even though they had sought a production  cut.
