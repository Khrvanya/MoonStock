Natural GasCuadrilla has announced it will start fracking at its sites in Lancashire "in the next few weeks".The announcement comes as the UK Government gave the go-ahead this week to carry out fracking at a second exploration well at Preston New Road.
 
Consent for the first horizontal well was granted in July earlier this year.
 
The company will run an initial flow test of the gas produced from both wells for around six months.
 
Hydraulic fracturing or fracking involves extracting gas from layers of rocks by injecting water and chemicals at high pressure.
 
Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry said shale gas has the potential to be a new domestic energy source, "further enhancing our energy security and helping us with our continued transition to a lower carbon economy.

She added: "It also has the capacity to deliver substantial economic benefits, both nationally and locally, as well as through the creation of well paid, high quality jobs.
