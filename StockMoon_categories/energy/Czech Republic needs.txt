NuclearThe Czech Republic will need to build not only one new unit at its Dukovany nuclear power plant, but also more reactors at Temelin if it is to avoid becoming dependent on electricity imports from 2030, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry and Trade Karel Havlicek said yesterday. Havlicek cited the latest Mid-term Adequacy Forecast (MAF CZ 2019) published on 18 October by high-voltage grid operator operator CEPS.The Czech Republic has six nuclear reactors generating about one-third of its electricity. Four VVER-440 units are at Dukovany, in Vysocina Region, and two VVER-1000 units are at Temelin, in South Bohemian Region. The country is phasing out its coal-fired power plants and will need to increase the share of nuclear power if it is to remain self-sufficient in electricity supply.
 
The government's long-term energy strategy, adopted in 2015, forecasts the need to increase the share of nuclear power in the country's electricity mix by 20-25% to 50-55% by 2050. Czech utility CEZ  has said it expects to operate the four Dukovany units until 2045 and 2047, and the two Temelin units until 2060 and 2062.
 
Czech power demand rose by 0.2% year on year to 73.9 terawatt hours (TWh) last year, which is its highest level since 1981, when records began. Production was 1.1% higher at 88 TWh, with brown-coal-fired facilities accounting for 43% of that figure, which was the highest share. Exports of electricity rose by an annual rate of 9.3% to 25.5 TWh - mainly to Slovakia and Austria - and imports - mostly from Germany and Poland - decreased by 23.2% to 11.6 TWh last year.
