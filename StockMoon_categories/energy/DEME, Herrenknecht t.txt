RenewableBelgium-based DEME Offshore and German tunnel boring machines maker Herrenknecht AG have signed an agreement to manufacture a sub-sea drill that will be used at the site of the 480-MW Saint-Nazaire offshore wind project off the coast of France.The drill, to be specifically designed for the project, will enable the installation of XL-monopile foundations on a rocky seabed at a distance of 12 to 20 km from the Guerande peninsula in western France.
 
Last year, the Belgian marine engineering group and France's Eiffage SA (EPA:FGR), in a consortium, secured a contract to design, manufacture and install 80 steel monopile foundations for what will be France's first offshore wind park. The 480-MW wind project is owned by EDF Renouvelables, of French utility group EDF (EPA:EDF), and Canada's Enbridge Inc (TSE:ENB).
