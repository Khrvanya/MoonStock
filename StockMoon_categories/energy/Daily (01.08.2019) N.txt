DailyA larger-than-anticipated decline in the U.S. crude inventories led to a further rise in crude oil prices on Tuesday. Furthermore, the interest rates were eventually lowered by the U.S. Federal Reserve, adding to the bullish market sentiment. Brent crude traded 0.7% higher at $65.17 a barrel, while WTI futures nudged up by 0.9% to $58.58 a barrel, as gains were reduced by waning hopes for an upcoming U.S.-China trade deal, as the negotiators postponed their next meeting until September.Most of the British wholesale gas prices rose on Wednesday, due to firmer buying interest. On supply side, production from UK gas fields weakened in anticipation of maintenance works from August 1, leading to firmer contracts. Limited Norwegian flows from Troll gas field lent more support to prices. NBP spot surged by 5.1% to 28.55 p/therm. The contract for delivery in Q4 2019 edged up by 0.4% at 44.88 p/therm. 
 
The European day-ahead power prices continued to diverge on Wednesday, while reversing trends. The price for the German spot power contract slumped by 7.9% to 44.66 EUR/MWh, weighed by an expected fall in demand and steady overall supply. Meanwhile, the price for the equivalent French contract soared by 32.1% to 42 EUR/MWh, as an unexpected outage at Paluel 3 reactor until Thursday curtailed country's nuclear availability.
 
Further along the curve, electricity prices turned bullish on Wednesday, tracking stronger oil and carbon prices, as well as the upward trend in the gas contracts. The German power contract for delivery in 2020 ended 0.5% up at 51.25 EUR/MWh. At the same time, the price for the equivalent French contract advanced by 0.2% to 52.46 EUR/MWh.
 
EU carbon prices looked set to recover on Wednesday, after falling earlier to a key technical support level due to a large fortnightly auction in Poland. The 2021-expiry contract closed 0.3% higher at 28.84 EUR/tonne, as traders expect a low level of auction supply in August.
