DailyOil prices ended higher again on Tuesday, attaining a monthly gain of over 5%, but analysts declared that the bullish sentiment that has driven prices to their peak in more than two years, could incite U.S. producers to export more oil. Brent crude rose by 47 cents, or 0.7%, to end at $61.37, near its July 2015 highs hit earlier this week, and up around 37 percent from its 2017 lows hit in June.

In the day-ahead market, electricity prices dropped and demand declined because of All Saints holiday in most of Europe on Wednesday and consumption would be slow to recover on Thursday. The German baseload contract for Wednesday delivery fell 16% to 30.90 euros/MWh. French Wednesday position was down 19.2% at 45.99 euros/MWh.
