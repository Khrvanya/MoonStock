DailyCrude oil prices diverged on Monday. WTI futures inched up by 1.1% to $59.09 a barrel, following OPEC's decision to extend its output cuts by another nine months until March 2020. Prices were also supported by the easing of trade tensions between U.S. and China, as their presidents agreed not to impose further tariffs on U.S. and Chinese goods. However, Brent crude settled 2.2% lower at $65.06 a barrel, due to persistent demand worries stoked by the slowing global economy and surging U.S. crude production.British gas prices were mixed on Monday. The NBP spot price soared by 11% to 26.70 p/therm, stimulated by a decline in the Norwegian flows due to an unplanned outage at Nyhamna gas plant, which occurred amidst the ongoing maintenance at Troll gas field. Stronger demand driven by lower wind power output and falling temperatures also supported prices. On the curve, the contract for delivery in December 2019 lost 1% to close at 53.28 p/therm, as two LNG vessels are due to arrive in Britain by July 15.
 
Monday saw an increase in the European prompt power prices. The German spot power contract edged up by 0.3% to 33.35 EUR/MWh, as outages at Grohnde and Brokdorf nuclear plants outweighed the bearish influence from the rising wind generation. The price for the equivalent French contract spiked by 16.4% to 33.95 EUR/MWh, due to reduced nuclear availability.
 
On the curve, electricity prices turned bullish, tracking a firmer carbon market, as well as gains in several oil and gas contracts. The price for the German power contract for delivery in 2020 rose by 0.7% to 49.52 EUR/MWh. The same gain was noticed in the equivalent French contract, which ended at 52.07 EUR/MWh.
 
EU carbon prices reversed course on Monday, rebounding from recent lows, in anticipation of a prolific auction week. The price for the contract expiring in 2021 jumped by 2.5% to 27.72 EUR/tonne.
