DailyOil prices rose on Friday after a rally in prices on geopolitical instability in Iraqi Kurdistan helped Brent make its biggest third-quarter price performance since 2004. Brent crude price settled 13 cents or 0.2 percent up at $57.54 a barrel, posting a third-quarter gain of around 20 percent. U.S. crude price increased 11 cents, or 0.2%, to end at $51.67 a barrel, its strongest third-quarter in 10 years and longest series of weekly gains since January. U.S. crude was up approximately 2 percent week-on-week.
 
British wholesale gas prices fell on Friday due to lower exports to Europe and reduced Norwegian flows. NBP day-ahead contract traded 5.05 pence, or 11%, down at 40.90 pence/therm. Meanwhile, the price for Summer 2018 delivery tumbled by 0.91 pence, or 2.2%, to 40.75 p/therm.
 
European spot electricity prices on Friday were mixed, with Germany's declining sharply for Monday, a bridging day ahead of October 3 reunification celebrations. French prices jumped, factoring in the surprise shutdown of the Tricastin nuclear plant starting from October.
French Monday baseload was 17% up at 42.12 euros/MWh. German baseload for Monday delivery was almost 39% below the price paid for delivery on Friday at 18.31 euros/MWh, as the holiday-related decline in demand coincided with more thermal capacity being added. 

Along the forward power curve, the French year-ahead contract was at 41.52 euros, down 2% on the day, but not far off its recent 43 euros contract high. Germany's equivalent price, the European benchmark Cal '18, settled 3% lower at 34.93 euros/MWh.
 
European carbon prices posted an insignificant increase on Friday, holding onto gains amid a strong auction result and despite European electricity and coal prices dipping as the week and quarter almost ended. December 2018 expiry EU carbon permits settled 1.6% up at 7.10 euros a tonne.
