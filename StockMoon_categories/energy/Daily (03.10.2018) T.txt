DailyGlobal oil prices slipped slightly on Tuesday due to reduced demand. However, the market's anticipation of tighter supply once U.S. sanctions against Iran's oil industry will come into effect early next month kept oil prices above $84 level. U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures, which have seen an over 18% rise since mid-August, lost 0.1% on Tuesday, trading at $75.23 a barrel. Meanwhile, Brent crude oil futures, that have increased by more than 20% since August, slipped by only 0.2% to $84.80 a barrel. British wholesale gas prices on the curve were mostly bearish on Tuesday due to an oversupplied system. Further along the curve, the Summer 2019 delivery contract settled 0.4% lower at 63.92 p/therm. Meanwhile, NBP spot price slightly increased by 0.2% to close at 71.30 p/therm. 
 
European spot power prices diverged once again on Tuesday. The German electricity price for day-ahead delivery slumped further by 56.8% to settle at 18.29 EUR/MWh, due to a rise in electricity production from wind turbines. Meanwhile, the French equivalent contract gained 3.7% to end at 68.71 EUR/MWh, due to higher consumption.

Along the forward electricity curve, prices rose despite a bearish energy complex. The German 2019-delivery contract ended at 54.90 EUR/MWh, or an increase of 1%. Similarly, the French equivalent Cal'19 contract settled 0.9% higher at 59.99 euros/MWh.
 
The European carbon contracts posted losses on Tuesday in a weaker session. For instance, the price for the contract expiring in 2020 closed 1.5% down at 22.41 euros per tonne.
