DailyA stronger dollar and global oversupply put pressure on oil prices on Friday. Nevertheless, losses were limited ahead of the 175'th Summit in Vienna, where OPEC and Russia will potentially talk about measures to reduce output. Brent crude price was 1.3% down at $58.71 a barrel, or more than a 1-year low. WTI crude also fell 1% to $50.93 a barrel.A slightly oversupplied system due to robust flows from Norway led to a decline in the UK wholesale gas prices on Friday. NBP spot price decreased by 1.6% to settle at 63.25 pence per therm.  The scheduled shipment of LNG cargoes during the weekend also weighed down on prices. The Q1 2019 delivery contract lost 1.4% to close at 67.08 pence per therm.
 
European spot power prices dropped on Wednesday, due to stronger wind power generation and weaker demand. The German electricity price for day-ahead delivery plummeted by 18.5% to 46.86 EUR/MWh. In the meantime, the French equivalent contract traded 6.6 % lower at 58.06 EUR/MWh, due to a rise in nuclear availability.
 
Further along the curve, electricity prices edged slightly higher tracking the upward evolution in the carbon emissions and coal markets. The German 2019-delivery contract was almost constant at 52.46 EUR/MWh. At the same time, the French equivalent Cal'19 contract gained 0.8% to trade at 57.67 euros/MWh.
 
European carbon contracts were encouraged by bullish coal markets on Friday. Moreover, supply deficit led to a price surge in a tight session. The price for the contract expiring in 2020 added 2.3% to settle at 21.38 euros a tonne.
