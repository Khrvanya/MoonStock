DailyOil prices continued the upward trend in a volatile session on Thursday. Saudi Arabia's production cuts under OPEC agreement tempered the concerns about a supply glut. Moreover, OPEC is set to support the market through more-than-planned output cuts by the end of January. Consequently, Brent crude rose by 1.9% to $55.95 a barrel, while WTI crude was 1.2% up at $47.09 a barrel. UK gas prices decreased on Thursday, as strong imports from Norway and additional LNG cargoes led to an oversupplied system. The gas price for next-day delivery went 1.8% down to 60.15 p/therm. The contract for delivery in Q2 19 traded 0.9% lower at 54.07 p/therm.
 
European spot electricity prices were mixed on Thursday. The price for the benchmark German power contract for Friday delivery plummeted by 13.5%% to 49.91 EUR/MWh, because of robust wind generation. On the other hand, the equivalent French contract traded 6% up to 64.93 EUR/MW, due to higher demand.

On the electricity curve, prices had a strong downward evolution tracking weak coal markets. German electricity contract for delivery in 2020 ended 3.8% lower at 49.21 EUR/MWh. The equivalent French contract settled 3.8 down at 52.36 EUR/MWh.

European carbon prices dropped in a weaker session on Thursday, in reaction to an array of declining factors. The 2020-expiry contract closed 7.9% lower at 23.83 EUR/tonne.
