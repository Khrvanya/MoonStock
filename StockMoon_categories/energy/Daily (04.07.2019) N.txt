DailyCrude oil prices added ground on Wednesday, as major U.S. stock indexes closed at record high levels.  Moreover, a decrease in the number of oil rigs, operated by U.S. energy firms, for the first time in three weeks, also lent support to prices. As a result, Brent crude climbed by 2.3% to $63.82 a barrel, while WTI futures closed 1.9% higher at $57.34 a barrel.
 British gas prices diverged on Wednesday. NBP day-ahead jumped by 2.2% to 27.50 p/therm, as several outages in Norway disrupted flows, leading to an undersupply in the system. Meanwhile, gas prices on the curve were in a bearish mood on Wednesday, influenced by losses registered in previous sessions and the expected arrival of more LNG vessels. As a result, the contract for delivery in Q4 2019 lost 1% to close at 44.27 p/therm at the end of the day.
