DailyOil crude prices rose on Wednesday, driven by looming U.S. sanctions on Iran, despite reports of higher Saudi Arabian and Russian production and the 8 million barrels jump in U.S. crude inventories last week.
WTI crude surged by 1.6% or 18 cents to $76.41 a barrel, while Brent price was 1.8% up at $86.29 a barrel. British wholesale gas prices were mixed on Wednesday. Further along the curve, the 2019 delivery contract traded 0.3% higher at 68.85 p/therm, due to an undersupplied system. Meanwhile, NBP spot price diminished by 1.1% to close at 70.50 p/therm, because of reduced demand and higher temperatures. 

Spot power prices in Germany had a strong upward evolution on Wednesday. The German electricity price for day-ahead delivery climbed by 256.2% to settle at 65.15 EUR/MWh, boosted by an unexpected decline in wind power generation. Meanwhile, the French equivalent contract gained 4% to close at 71.50 EUR/MWh, due to a fall in nuclear power supply following outages at EDF's Gravelines 6, Belleville 2, and Tricastin 2 reactors.

Along the forward electricity curve, prices were slightly bearish. The French equivalent Cal'19 contract settled 0.3% lower at 59.83 euros/MWh. At the same time, the German 2019-delivery contract ended at 54.91 EUR/MWh, or a 0.4% decline. 

The European carbon contracts regained positions on Wednesday, due to a stronger energy complex. The price for the contract expiring in 2019 rose by 1% to 21.91 euros per tonne.
