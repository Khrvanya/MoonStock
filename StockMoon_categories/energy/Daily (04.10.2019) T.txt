DailyCrude oil prices slightly diverged on Thursday. WTI futures edged down by 0.4% to $52.45 a barrel, amid mounting crude demand worries, after pessimistic services sector and job growth figures in the U.S. added to the bearish macroeconomic tone set by earlier weak manufacturing readings. A stall in the Euro zone business growth reported for September also kept market under pressure. However, losses were capped by data showing lower U.S. oil output in July. Meanwhile, Brent crude was a shade higher at $57.71 a barrel, on hopes that a positive development might occur in the U.S.-China trade talks when these will resume on October 10. UK gas prices on the curve continued to fall on Thursday, influenced by important losses on the carbon market. Consequently, the price for delivery in Q2 2020 sank by 1.9% to 42.01 p/therm. In the meantime, NBP spot hiked by 6% to 29.25 p/therm, on forecasts for increased residential consumption due to colder weather. The price was also boosted by unplanned outages at several Norwegian gas fields which reduced flows to Britain.
 
European spot electricity prices reversed trend, remaining mixed on Thursday. The price for the German day-ahead power contract rebounded by 9% to 43.68 EUR/MWh, as consumption strengthened after the unification holiday on October 3, while weaker renewables generation lent more support to the market. Meanwhile, the price for the equivalent French contract fell by 2% to 40.00 EUR/MWh, after news that French Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN) requested more data from French firm Framatome about welding issues on some reactors' steam generators. 
 
Forward power prices extended their decline on Thursday, in reaction to the fall in carbon prices and sluggish fuel futures. The German power contract for delivery in 2020 traded 1.7% down at 46.61 EUR/MWh. The equivalent French contract price dropped by 2% to 49.25 EUR/MWh.
 
The EU carbon prices slumped to a six-month low on Thursday, amid recession fears stoked by poor economic growth data in the Euro zone and trade divergences between the U.S., China and Europe. Growing Brexit tensions due to the approaching deadline added pressure on the market. As a result, the 2020-expiry contract price plunged by 3.9% to 23.45 EUR/tonne.
