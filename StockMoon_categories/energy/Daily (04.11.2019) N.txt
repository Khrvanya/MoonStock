DailyCrude oil prices posted robust gains on Friday, stimulated by higher-than-expected U.S. employment data in October and optimism that Chinese factory activity expanded at the fastest rate since 2017. On trade talks side, the U.S. and China are moving closer towards a Phase One trade deal, which might be signed this month. That bullish background sent WTI futures 3.7% up at $56.20 a barrel, while Brent crude hiked by 2.4% to $61.69 a barrel. A sharp fall in Norwegian flows via the Langeled pipeline led to an undersupplied system, weighing on British wholesale gas prices on Friday. Moreover, forecasts for colder weather in the coming week raised the prospect of a stronger gas demand for heating. As a result, NBP spot soared by 25.5% to 29 p/therm. On the curve, the contract price for delivery in Q1 2020 climbed by 1.2% to 45.49 p/therm, despite healthy LNG supplies.
 
European spot electricity prices dipped on Friday, amid reduced demand due to a public holiday in parts of the region. The French day-ahead power contract posted a 14.8% daily loss, trading at 27.48 EUR/MWh, while the German equivalent contract price slumped by 10.5% to 28.38 EUR/MWh. 
 
Meanwhile, forward power prices turned bullish on Friday, tracking the upward movements in the gas, coal and oil markets. The German Cal 2020 delivery contract edged 0.4% higher at 46.75 EUR/MWh. At the same time, the French equivalent contract price advanced by 0.2%, closing at 49.25 EUR/MWh.
 
EU carbon prices extended losses on Friday, as a choppy trade offset the bullish stimulus from a strong session and firmer fuel contracts. The contract expiring in 2020 ended 1.3% lower at 25.44 EUR/tonne.
