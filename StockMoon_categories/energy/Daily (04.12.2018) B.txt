DailyOil prices jumped on Monday, after Qatar decided to quit the OPEC club in January 2019. Furthermore, US-China trade tensions eased as no additional tariffs will be imposed during a period of 90-days. Expectations for OPEC supply reduction also stimulated prices. Brent crude price increased by 5.1% to $61.69 a barrel. Meanwhile, WTI crude gained 4% to $52.95 a barrel. The upward trend in UK gas prices on Monday was caused by an undersupplied system due to reduced flows from Norway. The January 2019 delivery contract was 1.8% higher at 68.77 p/therm. Moreover, stronger demand for heating because of lower temperatures forecasts and higher demand from power generators due to reduced wind production boosted the spot price. NBP day-ahead gas price rose 4.6% to 66.15 p/therm. 
 
European spot power prices for day-ahead delivery were bullish on Monday, due to weaker wind generation and increased demand because of cooler weather. The baseload price for day-ahead delivery in Germany added 8.1% to 50.65 euros/MWh.
