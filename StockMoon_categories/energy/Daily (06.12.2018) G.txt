Meanwhile, WTI crude fell 0.7% to $52.89 a barrel, as losses were limited by potential cuts in oil production.British gas prices slumped on Wednesday, mainly due to higher temperatures forecasts and weaker demand. Moreover, stronger wind production weighed down on the demand for gas from power generators. Consequently, NBP spot price decreased by 2.2% to 62.60 p/therm. Q1 2019 delivery contract traded 3% down at 64.59 p/therm.

Electricity prices on the curve also fell on Wednesday, due to a bearish energy complex. The 2019-delivery contract price in Germany dropped by 1.2% to 51.67 euros/MWh. The French equivalent contract was 1.1% lower at 57.26 euros/MWh.
 
Carbon prices collapsed close to the EUR20 level on Wednesday, as a weak auction could not provide support. Correspondingly, the carbon contract expiring in 2020 ended 5% down at 20.57 euros a tonne.
