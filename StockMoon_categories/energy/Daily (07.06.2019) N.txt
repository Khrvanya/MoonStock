DailyCrude oil prices rose on Thursday, following the hiking U.S. stocks which were boosted by a report showing that U.S. could delay tariffs on imported goods from Mexico. Brent crude added 1.7% to trade at $61.67 a barrel, while WTI futures jumped by 1.8% to $52.59 a barrel. Still, last week's surge in U.S. crude stocks coupled with new threats from U.S. President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on further Chinese goods could limit the rally.UK gas prices dipped on Thursday, amid continued system oversupply due to robust Norwegian flows and slack consumption.

European day-ahead power prices diverged on Thursday. The German spot power contract gained 3.1% to end at 37.61 EUR/MWh, due to firmer demand driven by high temperatures and the start of the cooling season.
