DailyOil prices were strongly bearish on Thursday, as the OPEC meeting in Vienna ended without an announcement of a decision to reduce crude supply. Brent crude price plunged by 2.5% to $60.06 a barrel. WTI crude lost 2.7% to $51.49 a barrel. OPEC and its allies are likely to discuss today about the terms of supply cuts in order to support the market.
On Thursday, UK gas prices continued their downward trend, as the arrival of three LNG tankers in the past two days left the system oversupplied. NBP spot price dropped by 3% to close at 60.75 p/therm. The expectation for two more vessels over the weekend put pressure on prices on the curve. The Q1 2019 delivery contract settled 1.6% down at 62.92 p/therm.
 
European spot power prices declined on Thursday, on milder weather and lower demand. The power price for day-ahead delivery in Germany fell by 22.2% to 42.58 EUR/MWh, due to higher wind generation. In the meantime, the French equivalent contract lost 15.5% to 48.66 EUR/MWh, due to increased nuclear availability.
 
On the forward electricity curve, prices tracked the bearish evolution in fuels markets. The German year-ahead contract ended at 51.54 EUR/MWh, or 0.4% lower. The French equivalent Cal'19 contract traded 0.4% down at 57.05 EUR/MWh.
 
Carbon prices turned bullish on Thursday, following Poland's decision to enhance the auctioned number of EUAs to 56 million. The price for 2020-expiry contract soared by 1.6% to 20.89 EUR/tonne.
