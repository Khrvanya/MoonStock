Energy MarketOil prices declined on Wednesday as financial markets slipped amid reduced worries that Washington's plans for import tariffs could spur a trade war, and after U.S. government data showed a hike in crude inventories and production. Brent crude lost $1.05, or 2.2%, to settle at $64.34 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for April delivery fell $1.35, or 2.3%, to end at $61.15 a barrel. 
 
British prompt gas prices decreased on Wednesday as supplies rose after last week's minor outages which coincided with freezing weather. NBP day-ahead gas price tumbled by 3.2%, or 1.70 pence, to 51.10 p/therm. Further along the curve, April 2018 delivery contract edged 0.4% lower at 48.07 p/therm.

European prompt power prices plunged on Wednesday on the back of forecasts for a sharp increase in electricity production from wind turbines and a decline in consumption. The German baseload contract for Thursday delivery slumped by 10.85 euros, or by over 22 percent to 37.53 euros/MWh. The French day-ahead baseload power contract traded almost 7% percent, or 3.36 euros, down at 45.43 euros/MWh.
 
On the forward electricity curve, the German Cal '19 position gained 0.2 percent to 34.39 euros, while the equivalent French contract edged slightly higher at 39.50 euros.

EU carbon prices continued the bullish evolution to reach a new six-year high on Wednesday amid signs of an over-heated market. The carbon contract expiring in 2020 ended 1.6% up at 10.80 euros a tonne.
