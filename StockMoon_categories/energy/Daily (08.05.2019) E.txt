DailyOil prices lost ground on Tuesday, due to returning concerns over global growth raised by ongoing complications in the U.S.-China trade talks. Expectations for rising U.S. crude production and stockpiles put more pressure on prices. Consequently, the Brent crude price dropped by 1.9% to $69.88 a barrel.Ample LNG supply coupled with increased flows from Norway in the context of weaker demand due to expected warmer weather and stronger wind generation pushed the NBP spot price down to 32.80 p/therm on Tuesday, which is 5.8% lower compared to the last trading session on Friday. In the meantime, the UK gas prices on the curve were predominantly bullish, backed by strong gains on the carbon market. The 2020-delivery contract traded 1.2% higher at 50.79 p/therm. 
 
The European day-ahead electricity prices plunged on Tuesday, as forecasts for reduced consumption due to rising temperatures and stronger wind output curbed demand. The price for the German spot power contract slumped by 21.8% to 39.47 EUR/MWh. The price for the equivalent French baseload contract dipped by 23.2% to 38.40 EUR/MWh, amid constant nuclear availability.
 
On the curve, power contracts extended gains on Tuesday, tracking the buoyant carbon prices and the upward trend in most of the gas prices. The German electricity contract for 2020 delivery closed 1.4% higher at 49.57 EUR/MWh, while the equivalent French contract added 1.2% to close at 52.43 EUR/MWh.
 
Tuesday saw a significant rebound in the EU carbon prices, which recouped losses after the compliance deadline. Prices were also supported by anticipations of scarce supply due to the accumulation of the newly bought EUAs. The 2019-expiry contract price surged by 4.2% to 26.40 euros/tonne.
