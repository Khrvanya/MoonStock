DailyCrude oil prices traded lower on Tuesday, after Donald Trump reported that a quick trade deal will unlikely happen soon. Meanwhile, oil prices were supported by protests in OPEC members Iraq and Ecuador, which threatened to disrupt their oil output. Hence, WTI futures fell by 0.2% to $52.63 a barrel, while Brent crude edged 0.2% down at $58.24 a barrel. Weaker gas-for-power demand driven by higher wind generation led to a 3.7% drop in the NBP spot price on Tuesday, which ended at 25.05 p/therm. Meanwhile, gas prices on the curve rose due to several unplanned outages in Norway that left the system undersupplied. The Q1 2020 delivery contract added 1.4% to close at 50.97 p/therm.
 
European prompt power prices diverged on Tuesday. The French spot power price slumped by 7.6% to 36.25 euros/MWh due to weaker demand. Meanwhile, the German equivalent contract closed 1% higher at 35.20 euros/MWh, as colder weather offset the surplus of wind generation.
