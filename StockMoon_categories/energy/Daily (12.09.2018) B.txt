Accordingly, Brent crude traded 2.2% higher at $79.06 a barrel. Meanwhile, WTI crude price increased by 2.5% to $69.25 a barrel.Recovered flows from one of the six main gas terminals, Easington, contributed to an oversupplied market, which led to a decline in the UK wholesale gas contract prices on Tuesday.
