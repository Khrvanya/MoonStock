Brent crude traded 0.1% up at $58.57 a barrel.

The contract for delivery in Winter 2019 settled 2.2% lower at 49.28 p/therm.

The European day-ahead power prices skyrocketed on Monday, in a correction move after the Sunday's plunge into negative territory due to strong wind output.

The price for the equivalent French contract spiked by 139.8% to 33.65 EUR/MWh, on more support from an outage at Chinon 1 reactor, which was provisionally extended to August 14.
 
Along the curve, electricity prices extended losses, tracking weaker gas and coal contracts, as well as the fall in carbon prices. The German power contract for delivery in 2020 ended 2.1% lower at 49.30 EUR/MWh, while the price for the equivalent French contract dropped by 1.7% to 51.55 EUR/MWh.
