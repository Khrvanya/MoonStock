DailyOil prices surged on Friday, remaining on track for a fourth consecutive week of gains, bolstered by a drawdown in U.S. inventories and a pullback in production, combined with steady demand and the extension of OPEC's global supply cut deal. Brent crude futures traded 61 cents, or 0.9%, higher at $69.87 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 14 cents, or 0.8%, to close at $64.30. WTI hit its strongest since late 2014 at $64.77 on Thursday.
 
British wholesale gas prices soared on Friday as lower temperatures boosted demand, despite high flows from Norway keeping the system oversupplied. NBP day-ahead gas price increased by 1.20 pence, or 2.3%, to 54.50 p/therm. Meanwhile, February 2018 contract settled almost 3% higher at 55.97 p/therm.

Further ahead on the power curve, Germany's Cal '19 baseload contract lost 0.6 percent to 35.60 euros. The equivalent French year-ahead contract was down 0.2 percent at 40.69 euros.
