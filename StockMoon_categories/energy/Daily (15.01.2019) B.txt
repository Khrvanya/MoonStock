Brent crude plunged by 2.5% to $58.99 a barrel, despite support from OPEC-led output cuts. WTI futures slumped by around 2% to settle at $50.51 a barrel.British gas prices lost ground on Monday due to an oversupplied system fuelled by strong flows. NBP spot price dropped by nearly 1% to 57.35 p/therm. Forecasts for higher wind generation resulted in lower gas-for-power demand, which also contributed to the decline in gas prices. On the curve, the NBP contract for delivery in February plummeted by 3.4 % to 59.30 p/therm, influenced as well by bearish oil markets.
 
European spot electricity prices traded higher on Monday as rising temperatures lifted power consumption in heating, lighting and industrial infrastructure. The German power contract for day-ahead delivery soared by 11.4% to 45.45 p/therm, while the equivalent French contract price surged by 13.8% to 60.94 p/therm.
 
Forward electricity prices retreated on Monday due to a decline in fuels and carbon emissions rights prices. The German power contract for delivery in 2020 ended 1.4% down at 48.04 EUR/MWh. The equivalent French power contract closed 1.2% lower at 51.41 EUR/MWh.
