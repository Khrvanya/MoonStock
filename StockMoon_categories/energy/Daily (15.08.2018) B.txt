DailyIncreasing trade tensions between US and China led to a decline in oil prices on Tuesday. Brent crude edged 0.2% lower at $72.46 a barrel, due to a pessimistic economic outlook and predictions of reduced demand. Meanwhile, WTI crude ended 0.2% down at $67.04, following the rise in crude inventories.Maintenance at Kollsnes processing plant is scheduled on August 17, contributing to a hike in gas prices along the curve. The contract for September 2018 delivery settled 0.4% higher at 62.37 p/therm. Nevertheless, NBP spot contract traded 1% lower at 60.40 p/therm, as warmer weather in Britain and forecasts for stronger wind generation weighed down on the price.
 
European 2019-delivery electricity contracts had an upward trend on Tuesday, supported by the bullish gas and carbon emission prices. The German year-ahead power price increased by 0.9% to 46.65 euros/MWh. Accordingly, the French equivalent Cal'19 contract closed 0.6% higher at 50.55 euros/MWh.

EU carbon contracts extended their gains on Tuesday, despite a weak auction which briefly sent prices below the EUR18 level. The 2021-expiry contract price edged 0.4% higher at 19.42 euros a tonne.
