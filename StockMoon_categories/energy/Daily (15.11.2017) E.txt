DailyOil prices dropped for a third consecutive day on Tuesday on forecasts for higher U.S. crude production and a gloomier outlook for global demand growth in a report from the International Energy Agency (IEA). Brent futures ended 95 cents, or 1.5 percent, down at $62.21 a barrel, while the U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude lost $1.06, or 1.9 percent, to settle at $55.70, the lowest close for both contracts since November 3.
 
Warmer weather and lower gas demand for heating contributed to a decline in British wholesale gas prices on Tuesday. NBP day-ahead gas price diminished by 1.05 pence, or 1.9%, to close at 53.25 pence/therm. Along the forward curve, December delivery contract traded 3.4% down at 53.08 p/therm.
 
German prompt electricity prices for the day ahead delivery firmed strongly on Tuesday on predictions of lower wind speeds, while almost all forward positions were down in a sell-off after latest gains. French Wednesday delivery baseload was at 78.39 euros/MWh, while German Wednesday delivery contract traded 61% higher at 64.67 euros/MWh.

Power curve prices decreased along with weaker fuels. Germany's year-ahead power contract, the European benchmark, fell 1.2 percent to 36.6 euros/MWh. The equivalent French contract shed 0.6 percent to 41.84 euros.

European carbon prices increased slightly on Tuesday to end a five-day losing streak, but not before the front-year contract tumbled to a new November low. Emission allowances expiring in 2020 settled 0.7% up at 7.43 euros a tonne.
