Nevertheless, market sentiment remained cautious because of worries that a supply glut might still happen amid a glum economic outlook. Brent crude futures gained 0.8% to settle at $66.62 a barrel. WTI crude was 0.4% up at $56.46 a barrel.Cooler weather forecasts and higher demand for heating boosted British wholesale gas prices on Thursday. Moreover, the strong upward trend was also caused by forecasts for lower wind generation and a rise in gas-for-power demand. NBP spot closed 3.1% higher at 70.20 p/therm. Summer 2019 delivery contract ended 3.3% up at 59.30 p/therm.

French power grid operator RTE declared that the country had enough supply for the winter, but it could tighten due to nuclear outages. The electricity price for day-ahead delivery in France ended 1.4% higher at 67.30 EUR/MWh, while the year-ahead delivery contract gained 0.4% to close at 57.97 EUR/MWh.

The carbon contract expiring in 2020 settled 3.6% higher at 19.94 euros a tonne.
