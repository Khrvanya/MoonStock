DailyOil prices remained under pressure on Thursday as increasing U.S. output and inventories threatened to destabilise a rally sparked by reducing world supply. Brent crude oil dropped 51 cents, or 0.8%, to $61.36 a barrel, on track for its fifth consecutive decline. U.S. light crude ended the session down 19 cents to $55.14, posting its a fourth straight day of losses and the weakest closing price in two weeks.

Oil prices have decreased from the two-year peaks attained hit last week by both crude benchmarks on signs that U.S. supply is rising and might potentially undermine OPEC's efforts to reduce the market.
 
Reduced gas flows from Norway and forecasts for colder weather drove British wholesale gas prices higher on Thursday. UK day-ahead gas contract was up 0.85 pence, or 1.7%, to 52.50 pence per therm. Along the forward curve, gas price for December delivery surged 1% to 53.27 pence/therm.
 
European spot electricity prices for day-ahead delivery were sharply lower on Thursday, under pressure from an anticipated decline in consumption before the weekend and higher electricity generation from wind turbines. The German baseload spot power for Friday delivery dropped by around 10% to 42.89 euros/MWh. The French equivalent contract slipped 7.75 euros, or more than 9 percent, to 73.55 euros/MWh.

Prices decreased along the forward power curve, tracking lower fuels and carbon emission prices. The European benchmark, Germany power contract for delivery in 2018, was constant at 36.20 euros/MWh. The French equivalent contract slipped 0.14 percent to 41.63 euros/MWh.

European carbon prices tumbled 2.6% on Thursday, giving back much of the previous day's 4% gains as sellers dumped units after prices failed again to top EUR7.80. The carbon contract expiring in 2018 slumped to 7.53 euros a tonne.
