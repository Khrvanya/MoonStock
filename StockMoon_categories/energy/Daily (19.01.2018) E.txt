DailyOil prices slipped on Thursday on a bounce-back in U.S. output, but continuing declines in crude inventories limited losses in the market. Brent crude futures traded 7 cents, or 0.1%, lower at $69.31. Meanwhile, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures was almost constant at $63.95 a barrel.British wholesale gas prices were mixed on Thursday. The NBP day-ahead gas price slightly rose to 50 p/therm, despite strong wind power output which helped reduce the call on gas-fired power plants. Further along the curve, contracts were bearish. February delivery price fell 0.90 pence, or 1.8%, to 50.11 p/therm. 
 
European spot power prices for day-ahead delivery surged in the wholesale market on Thursday, supported by forecasts showing a sharp decline in wind electricity generation and higher demand in France due to cold weather. The German prompt power price for Friday delivery soared 33.51 percent, or 10.16 euros, to 40.48 euros/MWh. The French equivalent contract gained 5.62 euros, or 16 percent, to 40.69 euros/MWh.

Further along the power curve, Germany's Cal '19 baseload contract was slightly lower at 35.27 euros/MWh. The equivalent French contract was flat at its 40.07 euros/MWh.

EU carbon prices jumped to more than EUR8.50 on Thursday, hitting a fresh two-year high in a third consecutive day of gains that continued to defy bearish fundamentals and predictions about another January sell-off. The contract expiring in 2019 ended 3.6% higher at 8.54 euros a tonne.
