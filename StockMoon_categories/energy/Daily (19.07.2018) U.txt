Meanwhile, WTI crude also hiked by 1% to $68.76 a barrel, even though U.S. oil production hit a new record of 11 million barrels per day.The upward evolution in the British wholesale gas prices on Wednesday was supported by disruptions in Norway which contributed to decline in supplies and higher demand from Europe after the closure of the Russian's Nord Stream pipeline, propping up the market.
