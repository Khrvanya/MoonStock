DailyOil prices soared on Wednesday buoyed by U.S. government data that showed a sharp drop in crude inventories due to strong export and increasing refining demand. As such, Brent crude rose by 1.3% to $68.50 a barrel, while WTI futures traded 2% higher at $60.23 a barrel. Still, gains could be limited by concerns on the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and its effects on global demand.British gas prices were mixed on Wednesday. NBP spot fell by 0.5% to 37.58 p/therm, influenced by milder weather establishment. However, a decline in flows from Norway pushed forward contracts' prices higher. The contract for delivery in Q2 2019 traded 2.1% up at 37.50 p/therm
 
European day-ahead power prices declined on Wednesday affected by an increase in wind power and forecasts for weaker demand. The price for the German spot power contract fell by 4.1% to 39.79 EUR/MWh, while the equivalent French contract traded 4.8% lower at 39.94 EUR/MWh, on firmer nuclear power supply.
 
Along the curve, electricity prices also lost ground, tracking lower coal prices. The price for the German power contract for delivery in 2020 slipped by 0.4% to 45.87 EUR/MWh, while the equivalent French contract edged 0.4% lower at 49.11 EUR/MWh.
 
EU carbon prices recouped previous session's losses on Wednesday, rising closer to the EUR22 mark, as a bounce in natural gas prices boosted the overall energy complex. The price for the 2021-expiry contract traded 2.4% higher at 22.47 EUR/tonne.
