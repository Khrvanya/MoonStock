DailyOil prices edged slightly down on Thursday after EIA reported a record level of U.S. crude oil inventories and crude exports since the start of 2018, amid ongoing concerns about slower global economic growth. However, the losses were limited by OPEC's output cuts, U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan and Iranian oil imports, as well as the advancing U.S.-China trade talks. Brent oil almost steadied at $67.07 a barrel, while WTI crude was 0.4% down at $56.96 a barrel.British gas prices slumped on Thursday as milder-than-forecasted weather curbed demand. Stronger gas flows from Norway after Langeled pipeline returned to its maximum capacity also put pressure on prices. NBP spot price plunged by 3.5% to 44.80 p/therm. Further on the curve, the Summer 2019 delivery contract settled 2.6% down at 45.15 p/therm.
 
Forecasts for lower wind generation supported the German spot power price on Thursday, which surged by 9.2% to 47.20 p/therm. Meanwhile, mild weather and weaker consumption coupled with rising wind output kept the equivalent French contract price rather flat at 47.02 EUR/MWh.
 
Further on the curve, electricity prices declined, following the strong downward trend in the carbon markets. The German power contract for delivery in 2020 dropped by 1.3% to 46.31 EUR/MWh. The equivalent French contract traded 1.1% lower at 49.38 EUR/MWh.
 
EU carbon emission prices posted substantial losses on Thursday, resuming their decline influenced by a bearish market outlook. The 2020-expiry contract plummeted by 8.1% to 19.20 EUR/tonne.
