DailyOil prices gained about 3% on Wednesday being propelled by a sudden decline in U.S. crude inventories.

European prompt electricity prices were mixed on Wednesday.  The large amount of wind supply weighed on prompt power prices in Germany.  The baseload contract for day-ahead delivery plunged by 16% to 43.59 euros a megawatt hour (MWh). Colder weather in France underpinned the market.

EUAs spiked by approximately 10% to hit a fresh 6.5-year high on Wednesday, as UK climate minister claimed that Britain would think about more ambitious opportunities elsewhere, even though cap-and-trade remained the government's favourite carbon pricing method post-Brexit. The carbon contract expiring in 2020 boosted by 9.6% to 12.82 euros a tonne.
