DailyOil prices hit a two-year peak on Wednesday after the closure of one of the largest crude pipelines from Canada reduced supply to the United States. 
 Brent crude closed 75 cents, or 1.2 percent, up at $63.32 a barrel. Meanwhile, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) futures settled up $1.19, or 2.1 percent, at $58.02 per barrel, the highest since July 2015, on worries over lower supplies on the Keystone pipeline and after the American Petroleum Institute (API) late Tuesday reported a 6.4 million-barrel crude drawdown for last week.
 
Higher heating demand predictions and outages led to a surge in prompt gas prices on Wednesday. Day-ahead gas contract traded 0.50 pence, or 1%, up at 53.75 p/therm. Nevertheless, the December delivery price fell 0.62 pence, or 1.1%, to 54.20 pence/therm.  UK Continental Shelf supply improved after flows via the Bacton Perenco and Bacton SEAL terminals recovered.
 
Wholesale power prices in Europe for day-ahead delivery were down on higher windspeed forecasts, with German baseload electricity for Thursday off 27 percent at 23.36 euros/MWh and the equivalent French position down 8.9 percent at 54.15 euros.
 
Prices on the year-ahead curve were mixed, tracking gains in oil, while coal and carbon prices eased. Germany's power contract for delivery in 2018 traded 14 cents down at 35.99 euros/MWh and the French equivalent contract added 14 cents to settle at 41.75 euros/MWh.
 
EU carbon edged lower on Wednesday despite the news that EU nations had offered their support to the post-2020 EU ETS reform bill. The carbon contract expiring in 2018 ended 0.3% down at 7.40 euros a tonne.
