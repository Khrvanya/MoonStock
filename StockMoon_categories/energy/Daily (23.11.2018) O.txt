DailyOil prices reversed trend on Thursday slumping to new one-year lows, after U.S. stocks reached the highest level since December last year, adding to concerns about global oversupply. Both Brent and WTI traded 1.4% lower at $62.6 a barrel and $53.86 a barrel, respectively. A quite balanced system left UK gas prices at almost constant levels, as stronger LNG supplies counterbalanced higher demand from power generators because of weaker wind output amid colder weather forecasts. NBP spot was 0.2% down at 66.35 p/therm. Further along the curve, the Summer 2019 delivery contract closed slightly down at 55.73 p/therm. 
 
European spot electricity contracts were mixed again on Thursday. The German spot power price gained 3.3% to end at 80.33 EUR/MWh, on forecasts for a decline in wind production. Meanwhile, the French spot price tumbled by 17.1% to 84.76 euros/MWh, due to lower demand amid expectations for higher-than-average temperatures.
 
Year-ahead power contracts posted slight gains, tracking the strong bullish evolution in carbon emissions prices. The German baseload electricity price for next year delivery rose 1.2% to 52.65 euros/MWh. The equivalent French contract traded 0.7% higher at 57.28 euros/MWh. 
 
European carbon prices gained further momentum to surpass the EUR21 level on Thursday, or a six-week peak, amid increasing hopes about Brexit and ahead of a cut in new supply and the first auction-free day in more than two months. The 2020-expiry contract added 2% to settle at 21.85 euros a tonne.
