DailyOil prices pared earlier gains on Wednesday as worries over slowing world economic growth weighed on the markets. U.S. Energy Information Administration voiced expectations for increasing shale output, which put additional pressure on prices. On the other side, China and Japan indications to use stimulus measures to boost growth, alongside with OPEC-led output cuts, limited losses. Consequently, Brent crude edged 0.6% down at $61.14 a barrel, while WTI futures lost 0.7% to close at $52.62 a barrel.UK gas prices gained ground on Wednesday due to undersupply caused by weaker domestic production because of outages. Lower LNG supplies, lower temperatures and stronger gas-for-heating demand lent more support to prices. On that background, NBP spot rose by 2% to 59.65 p/therm. On the curve, the NBP Q2-delivery contract traded 1% higher at 53.90 p/therm, as forecasts for increased gas flows via InterconnectorUK pipeline limited the bullish sentiment.
 
European electricity prices continued the upward evolution on Wednesday as cold weather bolstered power usage. Moreover, weaker wind power output led to a rise in the German spot power price, which hiked by 14.3% to 85.80 p/therm. The equivalent French contract price soared by 13% to 85.94 p/therm, despite a slight increase in solar power generation and 2% rise in nuclear availability.
 
Along the forward curve, electricity prices were rather constant. The German year-ahead contract settled 0.2% higher, in response to developments on coal and gas markets. The equivalent French contract traded 0.2% lower at 55.03 p/therm, on the back of measures initiated by French governments and EDF in order to secure alternative power generation sources.
 
European carbon prices declined on Wednesday, as traders were cautious about the bearish implications of the German coal phaseout plan. The 2021-expiry contract price settled 1.8% lower at 25.78 euros a tonne.
