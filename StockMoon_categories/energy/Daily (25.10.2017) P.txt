DailyOil prices rose on Tuesday after major exporter Saudi Arabia stated that it was decided to end a supply glut, while prices also encouraged by forecasts of a further drop in U.S. crude inventories as well as concerns over tensions in Iraqi Kurdistan. Brent crude rose 1.7% percent to $58.33 a barrel, while U.S. crude soared by 57 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $52.47. Prompt British wholesale gas prices climbed on Tuesday, as an unpredicted outage at a UK gas terminal led to an undersupplied market. NBP day-ahead gas price increased by 0.35 pence, or 0.8%, to 45.35 p/therm. Summer 2018 gas contract closed 0.12 pence, or 0.3%, higher at 48.20 p/therm.
 
A surge in wind supply on Tuesday weighed down German prompt power prices in the wholesale market while prices in neighbouring France rose on a tight nuclear supply balance. The price of German baseload power for Wednesday declined 11.4 percent to 33.77 euros/MWh. The equivalent French price gained 4.2 percent to 60.17 euros.
 
Prices along the electricity curve stabilised, following firmer fuels and carbon after being knocked down by profit-taking from new peaks that the market hit last week in the context of the French nuclear situation. German year-ahead baseload power contract, the European benchmark, was at 36.19 euros/MWh, up 24 cents. The equivalent French 2018 delivery contract was 42 cents higher at 41.75 euros.
 
EU carbon prices ended a three-day slump on Tuesday despite another weak auction, as one analyst saw a slight possibility that prices would dip much further this week. December 2018 expiry EU carbon permits settled 0.4 percent up at 7.50 euros a tonne.
