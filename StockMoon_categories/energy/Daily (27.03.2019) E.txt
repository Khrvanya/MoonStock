DailyTuesday saw a steep rise in oil prices on Tuesday, on the back of OPEC-led output cuts and expectations for a decline in U.S. inventories ahead of weekly API data, which offset worries about a global economic slowdown. Moreover, the second power cut in Venezuela this month also boosted prices. WTI futures traded 1.9 % up at $59.94 a barrel, while Brent crude added 1.1% to close at $67.97 a barrel. UK gas prices turned bullish on Tuesday as cooler weather lifted gas-for-heating consumption. Moreover, growing gas demand from power plants due to an expected drop in wind power supply lent more support to prices. The NBP spot price increased by 1.4% to 36.25 p/therm. On the curve, the price for Q2 2019 delivery contract inched 0.6% higher at 35.11 p/therm.
 
European day-ahead electricity prices surged on Tuesday, bolstered by declining wind output amid strong demand driven by relatively cold weather. The German spot power price soared by 10.1% to 40.19 EUR/MWh. In the meantime, the equivalent French contract ended at 39.97 EUR/MWh, posting a 7.9% hike.
 
Along the forward curve, power prices reversed trend to rise, stimulated by a firmer energy complex. The price for the German power contract for delivery in 2020 jumped by 2.4% to 46.31 EUR/MWh. The equivalent French contract was 2% up at 49.67 EUR/MWh.
 
European carbon prices extended gains in a strong session on Tuesday, rebounding from an earlier three-week low amid supportive coal prices which buoyed the energy complex. The contract expiring in 2020 closed 2.9% higher at 21.87 EUR/tonne.
