DailyOil prices were slightly up on Friday, as Venezuelan exports could face potential sanctions from U.S. amid political unrest in Caracas, raising the prospect of reduced crude supply. However, worries over U.S.-China trade dispute and growing U.S. fuel stocks put a lid on prices. As a result, Brent crude added 0.9% to settle at $61.64 a barrel, while WTI futures rose 1.1% to $53.69 a barrel.British gas prices lost ground on Friday, due to an oversupplied system caused by a drop in residential gas demand driven by milder weather. Increased domestic gas send-out and strong flows from Norway also contributed to supply glut, weighing on prices. Moreover, an expected rise in wind output reduced gas usage in gas-fired power stations. On that background, NBP spot retreated by nearly 2% to 55.25 p/therm. The NBP price for delivery in Q2 2019 fell 2.1% to 50.98 p/therm.
 
Friday saw a downfall in European spot electricity prices on forecasts for lower consumption and higher wind generation. The German spot power price tumbled by 26.2% to 49.09 p/therm, weighed by rising temperatures. The equivalent French contract dipped by 21.8% to 54.39 p/therm, due to stable nuclear availability.
 
Further along the curve, electricity forward prices continued the bearish trend on Friday tracking weaker carbon and other fuels markets. The German power contract for delivery in 2020 traded 1.4% down at 50.42 p/therm. The equivalent French contract closed 1.6% lower at 53.49 p/therm.
 
European carbon prices decreased slightly on Friday, on concerns over Brexit developments and Germany's coal phaseout decision. The 2020-expiry contract price ended 0.6% lower at 24.39 euros a tonne.
