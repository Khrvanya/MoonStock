DailyOil prices ended close to an equilibrium on Thursday after initially dropping in the wake of a new call from US President Donald Trump for an increase in OPEC's production in order to bring rising prices down. Brent crude was almost steady at $67.82 a barrel, while WTI futures slipped by 0.2 % to $59.30 a barrel, as losses were capped by constant support from OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan and Iranian exports.Thursday saw a decline in the UK gas prices, driven by short-term forecasts for slightly milder weather and expected robust LNG supplies. Bearish coal prices also weighed on prices. The contract price for delivery in June 2019 spiked by 2.8% to 34.98 p/therm. Meanwhile, NBP spot was 0.9% down at 37.10 p/therm, as lower Norwegian flows limited a further decrease.
 
European day-ahead electricity prices lost ground on Thursday, due to a weaker demand caused by rising temperatures ahead of the weekend. Stronger power generation from renewable sources put more pressure on prices. The German spot power price slumped by 5.8% to 39.85 EUR/MWh. In the meantime, the price for the equivalent French contract fell by 2.8% to 39.34 EUR/MWh.
 
Along the forward curve, power prices posted modest gains on Thursday, influenced by higher carbon prices. The price for the German power contract for delivery in 2020 added 0.3% to close at 47.43 EUR/MWh. The equivalent French contract edged up by 0.4% at 50.62 EUR/MWh.
