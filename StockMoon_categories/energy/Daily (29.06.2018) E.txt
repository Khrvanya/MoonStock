DailyOil supply shortage and higher demand after latest U.S. sanctions contributed to an increase in prices on Thursday.  Moreover, the draw in U.S. crude stocks also led to the upward evolution in prices. Brent crude soared by 0.3% to $77.85 a barrel, while WTI crude settled around 1% higher at $73.45 a barrel.Stronger supply from Total's Elgin-Franklin led to an oversupplied market, weighing down on most of the gas prices on Thursday. Consequently, NPB spot price dropped by 0.9% to 54.4 p/therm, while the Winter delivery contract was almost steady at 63.88 p/therm. On the other hand, the 2019 delivery contract ended 0.2% higher at 55.3 p/therm, as UIK returned from maintenance.  
 
European spot power prices were mixed on Thursday. The German day-ahead electricity contract was bearish due to higher wind generation, closing 1.3% lower at 44.32 EUR/MWh. Meanwhile, the French equivalent contract was supported by reports of several reactor capacity losses, settling 2.5% higher at 46.19 EUR/MWh.

Prices on the power forwards curve firmed, with the French Cal'19 delivery contract up 0.9 % at 47.83 EUR/MWh, and the German equivalent contract 1% higher at 43.14 EUR/MWh.

After the latest gains, EU carbon prices lost ground on Thursday. The 2020-expiry carbon contract settled 1.6% down at 15.55 euros a tonne.
