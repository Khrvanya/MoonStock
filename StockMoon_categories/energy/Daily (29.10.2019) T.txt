DailyOil prices lost momentum on Monday, as traders expected a rise in the U.S. crude inventories. Moreover, the outlook for the global crude demand dimmed further because of pessimistic industrial data in China, weighing on the market sentiment. Consequently, Brent crude inched down by 0.7% to $61.57 a barrel, while WTI futures dropped by 1.5% to $55.81 a barrel. British wholesale gas prices weakened on Monday, under the influence of firmer domestic supply from the UK Continental Shelf following an outage at the Forties pipeline. More pressure came from a high number of LNG cargoes due to arrive in Britain by November 9. Hence, the NBP spot price tumbled by 5.9% to 26.35 p/therm. On the curve, the Q1 2020 delivery contract traded 2% lower at 45.57 p/therm. 
 
European spot power prices increased sharply on Monday, rebounding after a previous steep fall, as colder weather boosted demand. Reduced wind generation also stimulated prices. The German spot power price skyrocketed by 138.1% to 48.11 euros/MWh. In the meantime, the French day-ahead power price spiked by 85.7% to 48.57 euros/MWh. 
 
Further along the curve, electricity prices remained bearish on Monday, in response to weaker oil, gas and coal markets. The German power contract for delivery in 2020 edged 0.6% lower at 46.67 euros/MWh. The price for the equivalent French power contract decreased by 0.8% to end at 49.48 euros/MWh. 
 
European carbon prices reversed earlier losses on Monday, boosted by news that the EU agreed to delay the Brexit deadline until January 31, 2020. However, a sluggish energy complex limited gains. The price for the contract expiring in 2019 was 0.6% higher at 25.12 euros/tonne.
