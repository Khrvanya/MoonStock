On Wednesday, European prompt power prices diverged. The Germany electricity spot price for Thursday delivery dropped by 4.9% to 50.4 euros/MWh, due to forecasts for higher wind generation and milder weather. On the other side, the price for the French equivalent contract edged 0.2% higher at 62.38 euros/MWh, after an unscheduled outage at EDF's Gravelines 3 power plant. 
 
On the forward electricity curve, prices declined, pulled down by bearish coal, gas and carbon markets. The German Cal'19 baseload electricity price fell 1.2% to end at 51.98 euros/MWh, while the French contract for 2019 delivery traded 0.9% down at 56.77 euros/MWh.
 
The bearish trend in EUAs prices on Wednesday was caused by a pessimistic outlook from traders and an abundant UK auction that cleared at a huge discount. The carbon contract expiring in 2020 closed 1.5% down at 20.18 euros a tonne.
