Brent crude rose by 2.3% to 61.32 USD/bbl, while WTI crude was up by 2.5% settling at 53.31 USD/bbl.British wholesale gas prices edged higher on Tuesday as the output from the country's wind farms is expected to drop, raising gas demand from gas-fired power stations. However, gains were curbed by stronger gas imports that left the system oversupplied. NBP spot price surged by 0.5% to 55.40 p/therm. On the curve, the contract for Q2 2019 delivery was also up by 0.5% at 50.57 p/therm.

Further along the curve, electricity prices also continued to lose ground tracking bearish coal and gas markets. The German power contract for delivery in 2020 was slightly down at 49.77 EUR/MWh, while the equivalent French contract closed 0.3% lower at 53.01 EUR/MWh.
 
A bullish energy complex led to a rise in EU carbon prices on Tuesday, recouping Monday's losses. The 2020-expiry contract price closed 2.8% higher at 23.84 euros a tonne.
