DailyOil prices eased on Monday, amid weaker stock markets and on signs of rising global supplies shrugging off US sanctions imposed on Iranian crude. In addition, Washington released a report indicating another round of tariffs on Chinese production, which also creates a bearish sentiment. Accordingly, Brent crude edged 0.4% lower at $77.34 a barrel. WTI crude lost 0.8% to $67.04 a barrel.Most of the UK gas contracts on the curve were bullish on Monday, as cooler weather forecasts stimulated the gas-for-heating demand. The 2019 delivery contract traded 1.4% up at 63.90 p/therm. Nevertheless, NBP spot was 0.5% lower at 65.20 p/therm, on continuous flows from Norway.
 
European prompt power prices were mixed, due to higher demand in France on one hand, and predictions of additional wind and solar supply in Germany on the other. The French day-ahead contract was 10.4% up at 73.12 euros/MWh. Meanwhile, the Germany baseload price for Tuesday delivery slumped by 30% to 33.67 euros/MWh. 
 
Prices on the forward curve fell, tracking the downward trend in coal, oil and gas markets. The French Cal' 19 electricity contract lost 2% to settle at 54.75 euros/MWh. At the same time, the German equivalent contract for year-ahead delivery traded 1.6% lower at 50.90 euros/MWh. 
 
European carbon prices extended losses on Monday reaching three-month lows. The UK would like to replace its participation in the EU ETS with a domestic carbon tax of around PS16/tonne (EUR18, $20.50) under a 'no deal' Brexit scenario, charging it over its existing Carbon Price Support emissions levy, as stated by the government during its autumn budget on Monday. The 2019 expiry carbon contract closed 8.8% down at 17.01 euros a tonne.
