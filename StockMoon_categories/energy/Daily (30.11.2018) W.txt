DailyOil crude prices jumped on Thursday, on positive expectations that the G-20 meeting would help global economy and would lead to a rise in demand. Brent crude price traded 1.3% up at $59.51 a barrel. At the same time, WTI crude surged 2.3% to $51.45 a barrel.
On Thursday, an undersupplied system due to reduced supplies from Norway boosted British gas prices. The December 2018 delivery contract traded 2.3% higher at 66.26 p/therm. NBP spot price rose 3.5% to settle at 64.3 p/therm, on colder weather and increased demand for heating. 
 
Lower wind generation and increased demand due to colder weather in Germany supported the electricity day-ahead gas price, which increased by 14.1% to 57.5 euros/MWh. Meanwhile, a stable nuclear supply in France maintained the power spot contract almost constant at 62.18 EUR/MWh.
 
On the forward curve, electricity prices turned bullish again, caused by stronger coal, gas and carbon markets. Both German and French power contracts for year-ahead delivery have been affected, trading around 0.9% higher at 52.44 EUR/MWh and 57.22 EUR/MWh respectively.
 
A significant increase in the energy complex contributed to higher EU carbon prices on Thursday. The price for the contract expiring in 2019 was 3.7% up at 20.36 euros a tonne, following a tight session result.
