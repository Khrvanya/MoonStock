DailyCrude oil prices posted robust gains on Tuesday, on hopes that the ongoing two-day meeting of U.S. central bankers would result in an interest rate cut for the first time in over ten years. Prices were also boosted by expectations that the U.S. crude stocks might have dropped for the seventh consecutive week. In addition, persistent supply concerns in the Strait of Hormuz lent more support to prices. Consequently, Brent crude rose by 1.6% to $64.72 a barrel, while WTI futures surged by 2.1% to $58.05 a barrel.Tuesday found British forward gas prices in a bearish mood, as record high continental storages for this time of the year weighed on the market sentiment. Hence, the contract for delivery in November 2019 traded 0.6% lower at 46.46 p/therm. Meanwhile, NBP spot inched up by 1.2% to 27.16 p/therm, amid reduced Norwegian supply due to continued maintenance at the Troll gas field. The price also drew support from the announcement of a five-day planned outage on the UK's Bacton Seal pipeline between August 1-6.
 
The European day-ahead power prices remained mixed on Tuesday. The German spot power contract continued its rise, adding 8.9% to close at 48.47 EUR/MWh, after data for June showed that Germany's power imports slightly exceeded the country's exports. On the other side, the price for the equivalent French contract declined further by 0.6% to 31.79 EUR/MWh, amid steady nuclear availability and limited demand for cooling due to an expected fall in temperatures.
 
Further along the curve, electricity prices lost ground on Tuesday, influenced by weaker carbon prices and bearish gas forward contracts. The German power contract for delivery in 2020 settled 1.7% lower at 50.99 EUR/MWh, in the context of a falling manufacturing sentiment in Germany, which could curb the industrial power demand. The same decline was noticed in the equivalent French contract, which ended at 52.38 EUR/MWh.
 
EU carbon prices dropped below EUR28 for the first time in almost two weeks on Tuesday, amid auction pressures and softer gas futures. Growing worries over a no-deal Brexit added pressure on prices. The price for the 2020-expiry contract tumbled by 1.8% to 28.25 EUR/tonne.
