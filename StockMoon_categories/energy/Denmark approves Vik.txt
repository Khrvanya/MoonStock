Lars Christian Lilleholt, Denmark's Energy, Utilities and Climate Minister declared: "Strong electricity connections abroad are crucial for a small nation like Denmark. We will be able to sell our power in a larger market when we have a surplus of renewable energy.
 
He further mentioned that they are getting at the same time a bigger supply of power to Denmark when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine.
