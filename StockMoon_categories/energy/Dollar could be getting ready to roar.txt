With a potential Fed rate hike as a tailwind, the dollar rally looks set to resume  and it could be powerful.  Since last week, the dollar index has gained more than 2 percent. But its surge since Friday has some strategists  thinking the greenback may have turned and will start  leading again, fueled by the prospect of Fed rate hikes."I think the markets are rushing to get long dollars again, and I  think the FX market is running ahead of rates again," said Vassili  Serebriakov, BNP Paribas currency strategist. "It's a little bit of a concern, in that I think we  need support from higher rates to keep the dollar moving higher. But  just about now, I think it's about getting off the sidelines to get  back into the long dollar trade."
