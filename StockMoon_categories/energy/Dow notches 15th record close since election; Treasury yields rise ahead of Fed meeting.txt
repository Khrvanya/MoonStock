According to  the CME Group's FedWatch tool, market  expectations for a rate hike this week are above 95 percent.  Luke Bartholomew, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset  Management said "this meeting is more about the guidance on  interest rates next year. Everyone is second guessing what a  Trump presidency will mean and financial markets think that Trump  could spell more inflation and growth. But that outlook is  dependent on the vagaries of U.S. politics, and frankly, Trump's  own personality."  Stocks have risen sharply since President-elect Donald  Trump's surprising victory over Democrat Hillary  Clinton, as optimism around the prospects of tax cuts and  fiscal spending have flooded the market. Since Nov. 8, the major  indexes have risen at least 4.5 percent, with the  small-caps Russell 2000 soaring more than 15 percent. The  Dow, meanwhile, has posted 15 record closes since then and  gains in 21 of the past 25 sessions.  "The top of the market is at the point of most optimism," said  Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird, adding  stocks could see a short-term pullback. "But I think people will  be hesitant to sell because corporate taxes might be lower next  year. That's why I think that any weakness here will be  short-lived."  Rob Lutts, chief investment officer at Cabot Wealth  Management, echoed Bittles' remarks, saying he thinks the post-election rally has room to continue. "It's very likely that the changes that are going on in Washington will be better than expected," he said. "The last time I can remember such a pro-business government was Reagan's in 1980."The S&P 500 rose 25.77 percent in 1980, according to FactSet data.  Investors also kept an eye on oil prices, as West Texas  Intermediate futures for January delivery gained 2.58 percent to settle at $52.83 per barrel, their best settle since 2015.  "Oil will be a cushion for the market, but ... yields are spiking  up and you have others that are going to keep investors  cautious," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First  Standard Financial. "I think the market has baked in a [Fed rate  hike] but not a more hawkish Fed."  After nearly a year of wrangling, the Organization of the  Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on Nov. 30 to cut output by  1.2 million barrels per day for six months from Jan. 1, with  top exporter Saudi Arabia cutting around 486,000 barrels per day  to curb the oversupply that has dogged markets for two  years.  On Saturday, producers from outside OPEC, led by Russia,  agreed to reduce output by 558,000 barrels per day, short of  the target of 600,000 barrels per day but still the largest  contribution by non-OPEC ever.  "Although Oil prices have staged an impressive rebound, concerns  still linger towards the compliance side of the cut deal with  anxieties rising over OPEC and Non-OPEC members  cheating," Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said in  a note.  "With the agreement not legally binding and no punishments in  place for going against the cut deal, there are fears of some  cartel members not respecting their pledge which could pressure  oil in the medium to longer term," he said.
