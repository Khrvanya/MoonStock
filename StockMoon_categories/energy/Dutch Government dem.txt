CoalThe Dutch Government has demanded the closure of a 650MW coal-fired power plant four years earlier than initially planned.The news comes after the District Court of The Hague last year ruled the government must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% by the end of 2020.
 
Operator Vattenfall said early closure of Hemweg-8 - by the end of 2019 - will have "major consequences" for its Dutch production operation and its employees at the power plant.
 
The amendment to the bill means the plant will have to stop operating without the previously announced transitional period of five years.
