The >>Kazakhstan Renewables Framework I<< was approved by the EBRD Board in December 2016 for the total amount of EUR200 million of the EBRD debt financing and is now 90 percent utilized. Under the framework, the EBRD supported 262 MW of solar generation capacity, one grid-strengthening project, and attracted four new international private investors into the Kazakh renewables market.
 
The goal of Phase II is to support Kazakhstan in reaching its 2020 renewable energy target of 3 percent of generation capacity, and also to accelerate the transition of the country's renewables regulatory regime to one based on the competitive tendering of renewables projects.
