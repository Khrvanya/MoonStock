SolarThe European Commission (EC) has given the green light to a EUR-600-million (USD 677m) public support scheme in France that aims to encourage solar power generation from innovative installations.The particular scheme is expected to support the installation of 350 MW of solar power generation capacity, either through ground mount or rooftop installations. Each project will range in capacity from 100 kW to 5 MW and will be selected through tenders organised until 2019. The winners will receive support from the country's state budget in the form of feed-in tariffs (FiTs) or a premium on top of the market price for a period of 20 years.
 
The EC said in a statement it has determined that the measure will further support the energy and climate goals of the EU without unduly distorting competition in France or resulting in overcompensation for the beneficiaries.
 
France is pursuing a renewable energy target of 23% in gross final energy consumption by 2020.
