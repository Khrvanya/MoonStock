RenewableEDF Renouvelables has reached the 2GW milestone for wind and solar capacity in France, following a record year for onshore wind for the company in the country.The company said in 2019 it had commissioned almost 200MW of onshore wind capacity and had a similar volume under construction in France. The figures include projects on French territories, with the repowering of its Petit-Canal wind farm (pictured) in Guadeloupe recently completed.
 
EDF Group and Canadian partner Enbridge have started construction of the 480MW Saint-Nazaire offshore wind farm, which is expected to come into service in 2022.
 
Construction on the Fecamp and Courseulles-sur-Mer projects is expected to start next year, it said.
 
EDF said also that it has completed the preparatory phase of its 'Plan Solaire', which seeks to re-establish the company's leading position in solar in France by targeting a 30% market share by 2035.
 
The growth in renewable energy in France forms part of EDF's CAP 2030 strategy, which aims to double the group's global clean power capacity to 50GW by 2030.
