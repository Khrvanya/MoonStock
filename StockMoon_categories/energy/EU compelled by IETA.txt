CoalInternational Emissions Trading Association (IETA) declared on Friday that EU negotiators should reach an agreement on the reform of Emission Trading System at the next meeting.  
IETA's Chief Executive Officer and President Dirk Forrister affirmed "We urge negotiators to redouble their efforts to reach a deal at the next trilogue meeting, set to be held before this year's round of UN climate negotiations in a few weeks". He also said that a deal is required so that a powerful message should be sent for EU to conserve its high role in the international climate policy sphere, and facilitating the success of the Paris Agreement.

The discussions held on Thursday between European Parliament representatives, the Council and the European Commission failed regarding coal safeguards suggested for the Modernization Fund.

The European Parliament proposed 450 grams per kilowatt-hour (g/kWh) emission performance level expecting to receive project funding to modernize the field. In response, EU Presidency declined the Parliament's request. When the Parliament stayed strong on its vision, the talks finished for the night with the commitment to re-start them. The fund is planned to enhance low-carbon transition in less developed EU countries.

IETA's director of EU policy, Julia Michalak stated in the press release "Business has been calling for clarity and certainty on rules for a long time, especially as the launch of Market Stability Reserve is drawing ever nearer. The reform process must finally bring predictability and boost confidence in the long-term future of the EU's carbon market."
