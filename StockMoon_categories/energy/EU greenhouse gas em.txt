CO2Greenhouse gas emissions fell by two per cent across the EU in 2018 according to the latest official preliminary estimates, but the relatively slow progress in renewable energy deployment and the decarbonisation of the transport sector continue to cause concern for the EU's environmental agency.The latest emissions trends and projections released by the European Environment Agency (EEA) yesterday indicate the EU achieved a two per cent cut in greenhouse gases last year, bringing total reductions since 1990 to 23.2 per cent.
 
That puts the EU firmly on track to exceed its 2020 target to cut emissions by 20 per cent compared to 1990 levels. But the EEA warned significantly more progress was needed to achieve the bloc's 2030 goal of a 40 per cent reduction, for which many member states remain off track.
 
At present only Greece, Portugal, and Sweden are expected to reach their individual 2030 climate targets, according to their 2019 reports to the EEA.
 
The agency also warned slow progress on energy efficiency, decarbonising transport fuels, and upping the bloc's share of renewable energy were also combining to put the 2030 target at risk.
