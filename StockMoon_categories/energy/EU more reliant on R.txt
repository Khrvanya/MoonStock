Natural GasRussian major energy company Gazprom, supplied Europe with record amount of gas, despite cold diplomatic relations between Russia and the European Union.Although EU is affirming that it is becoming less dependent from Russian gas, figures show that record deliveries towards Europe and Turkey were attained in 2017. The total quantity of exported gas is estimated at 193.9 billion cubic metres, or an increase of 8 percent compared with its previous record established in 2016.

After Ukraine crisis that burst in 2014, EU was intensively looking for diversification of supplies. It became easier to achieve that with the development of the market for liquefied natural gas (LNG). Its main advantage is that transportation is provided by shipping rather than pipelines, facilitating the imports from Qatar and even the United States.

According to a Russian analyst, Valery Nesterov, EU demand for gas is rising as its price is more affordable than that for coal. Nesterov forecasts a potential reduction of Russian exports to EU, but he also assures that the overall trend will be maintained as Gazprom will keep its European market.

Projects such as South Stream, TurkStream, and North Stream 2, via the Baltic Sea, which according to Russian giant are necessary for the increased European demand, were argued by the European partners. South Stream, a Russian project to facilitate exports to southern European countries, has been blocked by Brussels.

EU is emphasizing the importance of diversifying energy supplies, but it is not concretely doing anything to change that. Russian gas price is lower, while costs for alternative gas will be higher.
