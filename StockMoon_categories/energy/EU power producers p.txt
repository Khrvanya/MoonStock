Electricity MarketThe industry association Eurelectric, under new leadership since last year, promised to make European electricity production carbon neutral well before 2050. The heads of three major energy firms visited Brussels on Wednesday (6 December) to emphasize their view over European power industry for the next three decades.The three CEOs, which are members of Eurelectric, presented a plan for electrifying more area of the daily life - domains like transport and heating, which have until now been supplied by fossil fuels. 

Francesco Starace, Eurelectric president, declared: "Electricity is at the point of becoming a much more important part of [Europe's] energy portfolio. Technology is bringing electricity to lower and lower carbon levels." 

Energy firms from all over the EU except Poland and Greece signed an initiative to meet Paris commitments and reduce effects of climate change, according to a report from EURACTIV's media partner, The Guardian. At the same time, the association continues to claim that the expansion of electrification in other sectors like transport and heating is just business interest.

The geographic split between energy firms from the North, which has more green power sources, and the East and South, which has less, has been particularly stark. 

The crisis in the coal sector is leaving Poland with a growing electricity production gap which is forcing the decision-makers to revise the country's energy mix. But politicians have until now postponed difficult decisions and a clear discussion about it, as stated by Joann Mackowiak Pandera.

Eurelectric mentioned about its plans to start several projects next year in partnership with other sectors. But some of the more hesitant members may need more convincement to accept the proposed path.
