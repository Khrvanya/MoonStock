EnergyEggborough Power intends to phase out its 2GW Eggborough coal-fired power plant in North Yorkshire, England at the end of September 2018 after it failed to secure a contract to supply back-up electricity generating capacity for 2018/2019.The site was built in 1970 and supplies about 5% of the electricity in the country. One of UK's oldest coal-fired power plants was due to be closed last March but has extended the operational life by a year after winning a contract, Reuters reported.

Eggborough Power managing director Adam Booth declared: "With the age of the plant and the current government's policy that all UK coal-fired power generation must cease by 2025, Eggborough has been under threat of closure for the past few years. We will work through the consultation with employee representatives and provide support to employees throughout this process."

Eggborough Power considers it wouldn't be economically reasonable to continue operations at the power plant after the completion of its actual capacity market contract which will close in September 2018. According to National Grid, in the latest capacity auction, UK has secured 10.66GW of backup power at 6 pounds/kilowatt/year for 2018/2019 period.

The company said they're planning to build a new 2,500MW gas-fired power station to replace the site of Eggborough coal-fired power station. The new power facility is expected to supply the electricity needs of nearly 2 million homes.  

According to its website, a new underground gas pipeline is scheduled to be developed to the north of the power station that can be connected to the national gas transmission system.
