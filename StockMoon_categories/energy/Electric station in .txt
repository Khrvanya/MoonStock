The coal plant might stop its activity by May this year.

Ian Luney, President of AES UK & Ireland, declared: "With the likely absence of any significant and reliable new generation in the next four years and a North-South interconnector that isn't expected to come online until 2021, we are concerned that the removal of capacity at Kilroot and Ballylumford could contribute to a significant risk to the security and stability of supply in Northern Ireland. We remain open to further engagement to continue to contribute to secure energy certainty for Northern Ireland in the near to medium term."
