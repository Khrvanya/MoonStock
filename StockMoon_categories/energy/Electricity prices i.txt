Electricity MarketThe average price of electricity for households in Norway increased by 66 percent in the third quarter of 2018, compared to the same period of the previous year, Statistics Norway (SSB) said on Thursday.This is the highest price jump since the first quarter of 2011, the authority said.
 
The rise in electricity prices in the third quarter of 2018 compared with the same period last year must be seen in light of energy shortages in the hydro power system, the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate said.
 
These shortages contributed to Norway's electricity price becoming on par with the more expensive prices charged in neighboring countries, due to price rises in gas, coal and carbon emissions.
