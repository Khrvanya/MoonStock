SolarEnel Green Power Espana (EGPE) has connected to the grid six 42-MW solar photovoltaic (PV) farms it recently finished building in the Spanish region of Extremadura, parent company Endesa SA announced today.The Spanish power utility said their installation involved an investment of around EUR 200 million (USD 220.6m).
 
The six equally-sized parks, which have more than 700,000 solar modules between them, were put up in Caceres and Badajoz provinces. Together, they are estimated to generate around 500 GWh per year.
 
The new solar farms are part of 339 MW of capacity EGPE won in the Spanish government auction in 2017. The first PV project from the lot, the 85-MW Totana in Murcia, was hooked to the grid this September.
 
In addition to 339 MW of solar, Endesa's renewables arm EGPE was awarded 540 MW of wind power capacity in government auction rounds in 2017. So far, all the solar capacity and 50 MW of wind are connected to the grid. Endesa said that the remaining 490 MW of wind farms would go live by the end of the year.
