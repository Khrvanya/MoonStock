WindGerman wind turbine maker Enercon GmbH has started work on an up to 1.1-GW wind farm in Sweden, targeting completion in 2021, a company official told Montel News.The capacity will be installed at Markbygden in northern Sweden as part of the second phase of the Markbygden cluster. Pamela Lundin, head of Enercon's Swedish operations, said, as quoted by Montel, that the first turbines from the facility are expected to be hooked to the grid in 2020.
 
Phase 2 of the Markbygden complex was initially cleared to have 440 turbines with a combined capacity of 1.3 GW, while plans for the scheme were subsequently adjusted to contain around 200 machines. Their capacity, however, will be almost double what was previously planned. This will create a wind farm of between 850 MW and 1.1 GW, while the exact capacity is still not known, Lundin said.
 
If constructed, the entire Markbygden complex will have a capacity of 4 GW, split into three phases. The project was developed by Sweden's Svevind AB. Enercon bought Phase 2 of the scheme in 2016 and split the ownership of the first parts of phase 1 with Svevind.
