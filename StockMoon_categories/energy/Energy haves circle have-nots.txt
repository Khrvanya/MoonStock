  The energy haves will be circling the have-nots in Houston this  week. Balance sheets and the fate of the recently announced Saudi  Arabia-Russia oil output deal will be on the agenda as industry  executives gather for the annual IHS CERAWeek gabfest. A  long-expected wave of dealmaking may finally emerge as weaker  producers' financing dries up.  When delegates last gathered in April 2015, crude was trading at  around $60 a barrel and Royal Dutch Shell had just launched its  $70 billion swoop on gas producer BG. A brief rally in crude  prices proved fleeting, though, and an expected wave of follow-on  deals never materialized. Instead, producers hunkered down as oil  prices fell below $40 per barrel, some 70 percent below mid-2014  levels. Global oil and gas M&A activity dropped 11 percent  during 2015 — overall a record year for deals, according to  Thomson Reuters data. The average  energy-sector stock  has tumbled more than 40 percent since mid-2014.
