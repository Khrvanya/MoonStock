EnergyThe controversial energy price cap for consumers on default tariffs has entered force today.Ofgem expects the move will save around 11 million people an average of PS76 a year, while opponents of the scheme suggest it could damage competition across the UK market.
 
The cap limits the cost of each energy unit rather than total bills, meaning energy-intensive users will continue to pay more than those with lower consumption.
 
The cost of electricity is capped at 17p per kWh, with gas being capped at 4p per kWh - this means a dual fuel customer using energy at typical levels and paying through direct debit is expected to spend a maximum of PS1,137 a year.
 
The energy regulator says the cap will be reviewed and adjusted twice a year to make sure it is fair and effective to all customers.
 
A number of consumer groups have claimed customers should continue to shop around and improve the efficiency of their homes to save the most money possible.
