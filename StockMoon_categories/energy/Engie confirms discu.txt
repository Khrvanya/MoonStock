Natural GasFrench energy firm Engie has confirmed that it is in business discussions with Total and other companies regarding partial sale of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) business, in the framework of its restructuring strategy.Regarding recent speculations in the press about a possible sale of its LNG business, Engie said that it has commenced a strategic revision of its upstream and midstream LNG operations. These include liquefaction, transport and global trading of LNG, as stated by the French multinational energy company. Liquefied natural gas downstream activities like regasification and LNG ex-terminal sales have been withdrawn from the process.

Engie considers that at this stage it is impossible to certainly affirm that there will be agreement signed, as any deal would have to be accepted by the legitimized governance bodies and the relevant employee representative structures would have to be consulted.

The company has not disclosed what revenue they expect out of the sale transaction. However, it looks to be almost completed in the near future, after a report from financial newsletter La Lettre de l'Expansion. Total unlike Engie is ready to make an official partnership. In the past, Total had confirmed its determination to sell gas and power in France by the end of 2017 with a target to have two million customers.

Engie executive vice-president Didier Holleaux, at a recently held conference in Singapore, said that the firm was searching for a partner for certain business activities. Holleaux stated for Reuters: "To make LNG profitable, we need to be as big as possible. So we're looking for a partner."

Under its CEO Isabelle Kocher, Engie is going through a reformation process that is susceptible to see sale of assets estimated at EUR15 billion and EUR22 billion of capital insertion into the company.
