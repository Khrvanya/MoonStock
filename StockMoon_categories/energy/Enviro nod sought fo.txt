SolarA joint venture between Germany's Wirsol and UK-based Tribus Clean Energy has unveiled plans for the construction of an up to 500-MW solar-plus-storage complex in England.The partners, through the Sunnica Energy JV, are seeking environmental approval for the scheme that will be the largest one of its kind in the UK, according to an environmental impact assessment scoping report published on the UK National Infrastructure Planning Service.
 
The proposal itself envisages the construction of two separate solar parks, namely Sunnica East and Sunnica West, near Worlington, Suffolk, and Chippenham, East Cambridgeshire. If the scheme is granted approval and a final investment decision is taken, the developers expect they could initiate construction in the spring of 2022, at the earliest, and commission the complex by spring 2025.
