Natural GasAccording to Eurogas, the European Commission's (EC) proposal to extend the common gas regulations to import pipelines should not advance until its impact is entirely evaluated within a timeframe that permits stakeholder to reveal its opinion. At the same time, the EC claims that it has been at the beginning of efforts directed at the full and fast implementation of the legislative acts, and considers that such an extension would contribute to the security of supply and the well-functioning of the market in the EU itself.

Eurogas thinks the proposal sets obstacles to current pipelines entering the EU, such as Medgaz (Algeria-Spain), TransMed (Tunisia-Italy), Green Stream (Libya-Italy) and Maghreb-Europe Pipeline (Morocco-Spain).

The security of supply in the EU is put at risk through these barriers. Investment security for project developers and operators, as well as to enlarging commercial ties and geopolitical relations between the EU and African countries are also at risk.

Also, Eurogas emphasized that the sovereignty of member states to decide between various energy sources they use and the general structure of its energy supply, without prejudice to articles, would be diminished. The possibility of negotiating bilateral intergovernmental agreements with exporting third countries on their own will be neglected for EU member states.

The European gas firm declared: "Inconsistency in the commission's arguments underpinning the proposal further weakens the points supporting it."
