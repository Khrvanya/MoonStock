LNGAccording to Giles Farrer, research director of global LNG at Wood Mackenzie, more sources of supply are necessary to substitute the falling domestic production of LNG in the European market.Ferrer revealed during the European Gas Conference in Vienna that Europe should secure new sources of supply having as an extra supply option- U.S. LNG.

He also declared: "I don't know if it's the question of LNG replacing piped gas, but Europe needs to replace declining indigenous production, and in order to mitigate its reliance on existing pipe supplies, we see the need for more LNG in the European market."

Russia has the largest share of natural gas imports with over 30 percent share of the European market. In 2017, Europe's imports from Russia rose 8 percent, hitting an all-time peak. Also last year, the Norwegian pipeline's exports attained a record level, up by 7 percent. Increased imports came mostly because of higher demand. 

The Center for Strategic and International Studies affirmed that through September 2017, demand in European member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development soared by 7.5 percent. This was caused by increases across Europe and Turkey, which, after two years of falls, indicated a significant growth that is now boosting imports.
