RenewableMembers of the European Parliament's Committee on Environment (MEPs) suggested to raise the EU's green energy objectives for 2030, the Parliament declared in a press release on Tuesday. The statement says that the share of power from alternative sources, such as solar or wind energy, should be at least 35 percent of the Union's gross final consumption of energy by 2030, according to Environment MEPs.
 
The approved legislative document is part of the reform of the renewables energy directive, a cornerstone of the EU energy and climate change policy, which had already established in 2009 a goal of 20 percent for 2020, comprising individual targets for each EU member state.

The European Commission proposed to continue the program until 2030, and to enhance the target to minimum 27 percent, as in an EU-wide objective. Members of the Parliament suggest reintroducing mandatory national targets to achieve an EU 35 percent goal. The draft legislation points out that with this proposal, the stake of biofuels should not exceed 7 percent of final consumption of energy in road and rail transport.

The report was approved by 32 votes pro to 29 against, and four abstentions. The Committee on Industry, which heads the main competence on this file, (except for the articles related to renewables and sustainability criteria, which belong to the Environment committee) will express its option on November 28 on whether to bring the proposal into law.
