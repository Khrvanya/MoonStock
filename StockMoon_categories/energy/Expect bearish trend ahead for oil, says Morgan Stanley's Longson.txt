  There are a number of headwinds still facing the oil market that  could knock crude prices down as low as $35 this year, Morgan  Stanley's head of commodity research said Tuesday.   "I don't think we're fully out of the woods yet," Adam Longson  said in an interview with CNBC's "Power Lunch."   "The bullish trend we saw early this summer is likely to shift  more bearish," he said.  He thinks a mid-$30s soft floor could come from OPEC chatter and  short positions in the market. However, he sees oil averaging $40  in the fourth quarter.   Not only is there still an oversupply in the oil market, one of  the biggest challenges has been the oversupply in the gasoline  market, Longson explained. He believes that ultimately needs  to be resolved before there is a real recovery.  "A refiner is the real consumer of crude oil, not you and I, and I  think that will be our catalyst," he said.  The good news is Longson believes the oil market will rebalance  by the middle of 2017.   Meanwhile, it isn't all gloom and doom for U.S. producers, whose  budgets have been hit by low oil prices. Some have said they will  be able to grow and add rigs at $50 oil, he noted.   "It really is the differentiation between haves and have-nots and  a race to improve your cost structure," said Longson. "I think  that many, many of the U.S. companies will ultimately be fine and  come out winners on the back end of this."  U.S. crude closed down 25 cents, or 0.58 percent, at $42.77 a  barrel Tuesday. — CNBC's Stefanie Kratter contributed to this report.Disclaimer
