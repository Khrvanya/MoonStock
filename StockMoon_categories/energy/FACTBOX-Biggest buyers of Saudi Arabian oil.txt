Sept 14 (Reuters) - Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group on Saturday attacked two plants at the heart of Saudi Arabia's oil industry in a strike that could impact about 5 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude production - close to half of the kingdom's output or 5% of global oil supply. The Saudis are the world's biggest oil exporters, sending more than 7 million barrels of crude to numerous destinations around the globe every day - equal to nearly one-third of exports by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The bulk of those exports go to Asia and the Pacific region, according to OPEC.BIGGEST IMPORTERS OF SAUDI CRUDE BY COUNTRY:Country         mln bpdChina           1.88Japan           1.02South Korea     0.89India           0.74United States   0.58Sources: Japans Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry; U.S. Energy Department; China General Administration of Customs; Korea National Oil Corp; India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Reuters; all figures June 2019SAUDI EXPORTS BY REGION (million bpd)DESTINATION    2014    2015    2016    2017    2018WORLDWIDE        7.15    7.16    7.46    6.97     7.37Europe           0.95    0.88    0.87    0.78     0.87North America    1.25    1.19    1.18    1.00     1.02Asia/Pacific     4.42    4.59    4.92    4.80     4.99Latin America   0.068   0.070   0.071   0.071    0.071Africa           0.19    0.15    0.15    0.16     0.16Middle East      0.27    0.28    0.27    0.16     0.27SOURCE: OPECBIGGEST U.S. BUYERS BY REFINERY, JULY 2018-JUNE 2019REFINERY             LOCATION           MLN BBLSMotiva Enterprises   Port Arthur, TX    61.0Chevron USA          Richmond, CA       58.6Paulsboro Refining   Paulsboro, NJ      35.2Andeavor             Los Angeles, CA    23.6Chevron USA          El Segundo, CA     19.0Phillips 66          Lake Charles, LA   12.9ExxonMobil           Baytown, TX        12.8Andeavor/Martinez    Golden Eagle, CA    9.0Marathon Petroleum   Galveston Bay, TX   8.3Valero Refining      Benicia, CA         5.5Source: U.S. Energy Department(Reporting By David Gaffen Editing by Marguerita Choy)
