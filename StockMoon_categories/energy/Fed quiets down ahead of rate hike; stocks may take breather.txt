  After several days of wild volatility, the stock market may use  the coming week to catch its breath, as it waits for the Fed to  end the historic era of zero interest rates later this month.  Markets are in full tilt, with big shifts in currencies, yields  and commodities prices in the past week. But they are also primed  for a Fed rate hike Dec. 16, after Friday's 211,000  November nonfarm payrolls showed a continuing solid trend of job  creation.  "It (the jobs number) sends the signal the economy is in decent  shape, but it's the final piece of the puzzle the Fed needs to  raise interest rates," said Scott Clemons, chief market  strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. The Fed is expected to  raise its target fed funds rate for the first time in nine years,  ending seven years of ultralow rates.
