RenewableFinland's environment minister declared the country would prohibit the use of coal in energy production in 2029. The Finnish government is also looking for a large-scale subsidy programme that will reward energy companies for abandoning fossil fuel before the expected time frame, as stated by EURACTIV.Environment Minister Kimmo Tiilikainen revealed that the government would advance plans for a 2030 ban on coal as an energy source to 2029. Helsinki will initiate legal framework in the coming year as part of its national energy plan for the next 10 years.
 
Finland is behind its Nordic and Scandinavian counterparts in terms of switching to a clean energy supply, as 10% of its power is still originated from coal. Coal use is associated with human health risks due to bad air quality and has one of the highest GHG emissions rates.
 
From a geopolitical perspective, abandoning coal will help Finland and, more broadly, the EU, reduce its reliance on Russian imports, as 66% of the nation's coal is imported from its eastern neighbor.
 
The decision to confirm and move up the coal phase-out disappointed the energy industry, as it is likely to be expensive for the government and inefficient as a climate measure.
 
The government announced that it would design a subsidy package estimated at approximately EUR90 million that would be used to reward energy firms that abandon coal by 2025. The idea is to increase investments in renewable energy.

With energy consumption predicted to hike in the upcoming years, Finland will need to substitute coal in the energy mix, where at present, nuclear power is among the leading contenders.
