WindProjects with a combined capacity of 576 MW were successful in the fourth call of tenders for onshore wind power capacity in France, the government said on Tuesday.The tender targeted 500 MW of capacity and is a series of a six-step procurement initiative that will support France in adding 3 GW of onshore wind through 500-MW auctions. As many as 20 schemes were awarded in the fourth round, the Ministry for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition announced.
 
The average price of the winning projects stood at EUR 66.5 (USD 73.01) per MWh, which represents an increase from the EUR 63/MWh in the previous such tender. The successful projects will be awarded 20-year feed-in premium contracts.
 
Most of the awarded capacity will be installed in the Hauts-de-France region in northern France, while the largest project, with a capacity of 111 MW, is located in the Marne department of Grand Est region.
 
France aims to lift the share of renewables generation in its total production to 40% by end-2030 from 20% at end-2018. Its multi-annual energy programme calls for between 21.8 GW and 26 GW of installed onshore wind capacity by end-2023.
