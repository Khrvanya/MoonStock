RenewableFrance reached a solar power generation record of 1.44 TWh in June 2019 as it enjoyed a lot of sunshine, and the country also saw wind power generation jump by 36% year-on-year to 1.86 TWh with the help of Hurricane Miguel.In a monthly overview, transmission system operator (TSO) RTE said domestic power consumption was stable in June at 32.6 TWh. The combined solar and wind power output thus accounted for more than 10%.
 
In contrast to the rise in wind and solar power generation, hydropower plants produced 24% less power than in June 2018. At 5.77 TWh, June output was the highest for hydro in France so far this year.
 
In mid-2019, France had almost 15.6 GW of wind and 8.86 GW of solar power capacity.
