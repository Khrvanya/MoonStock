RenewableThe French government last week published a draft 10-year energy plan that would see its installed renewables capacity more than double to 113 GW by 2028, mainly by fresh wind and solar power additions.For comparison, the combined capacity of the country's renewable energy assets at end-2017 was 48.6 GW. Under the new plan that capacity will reach 74 GW by 2023 and between 102 GW and 113 GW in 2028. Meanwhile, 14 nuclear power reactors will be shut down by 2035, including those of the Fessenheim power station, as announced in November 2018.
 
On the renewables front, France envisages holding tenders in support of the new programme. Thus, onshore wind capacity will grow to 24.6 GW by 2023 and up to 35.6 GW by 2028, while offshore wind will rise to 2.4 GW in 2023, reaching between 4.7 GW and 5.2 GW in 2028.
 
Solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity will range between 35.6 GW and 44.5 GW in 2028, with 20.6 GW installed by 2023. Hydropower capacity is planned to be 26.4 GW-26.7 GW in 2028.
 
The draft plan is currently open for consultation, according to the government's statement. As President Emmanuel Macron said in November 2018, France will increase renewables spending from the current EUR 5 billion (USD 5.72bn) per year to EUR 7 billion-8 billion.
