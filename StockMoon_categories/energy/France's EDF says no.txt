EDF's deputy director for nuclear production Regis Clement told journalists in a conference call that the mostly visual checks carried out so far have revealed no structural damage.
 
"There are no visible consequences of the earthquake on the Cruas plant," he said, adding that further examinations are being carried out on concrete structures, beams, pipes and other systems.
 
He said readings from sensors that record movements at the plant around the clock will be examined, and the results transmitted to French nuclear safety agency ASN, which will decide whether and when the reactors can restart.
