EnergyFrench energy company EDF inked two energy service accords with China during the French president's three-day official visit to China which started on January 8.The first contract includes design, construction and 30-year exploitation of a network of stations for chilled water for air conditioning, sanitation and hot water production in the municipality of Sanya, located in the southern province of Hainan with a population of 700,000. 

The high productive network equipped with solar panels and a smart operating system, contributes to CO2 emissions cuts by around 20 percent compared to individual systems.

The second contract aims the construction and operation of a 35-megawatt biomass cogeneration plant for 30 years in the town of Lingbao with a population of 750,000, located in the province of Henan in the center of the country. 

The plant will deliver power and heating to around 25,000 homes in the town. The municipality can totally stop using individual coal-fired boilers right after the commissioning of the plant scheduled for 2019.

Jean-Bernard Levy, the EDF group chairman and chief executive declared: "With the aim of reducing its energy intensity by 15 percent by the year 2020, China represents an energy service market with high potential. The two new contracts consolidate the group's position in China and fits in with our strategy CAP 2030, which plans to triple EDF activity abroad in countries with high growth by the year 2030."
