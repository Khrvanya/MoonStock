NuclearFrance and Switzerland have been affected by quality assessment issues. EDF Group stated that Areva had found out that quality control deviations occur on specific rods, which meant the provider was incapable to demonstrate that quality control to prove that the leak tightness of those rods had been properly carried out.Fourteen units out of several 2.6 million that are installed in France's nuclear fleet are affected. Three of them are currently in operation in Cattenom 3, Flamanville 1 and Golfech 2. The remainder have not been implanted in reactors. The company said measurements have been performed at those reactors showed them to be working in a safe mode.

The Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate (ENSI) iterated that it had been announced that the Leibstadt nuclear plant had been supplied with some fuel mixes containing fuel rods that did not meet its specifications. The regulatory authority affirmed that the relevant rods were affected by quality assurance mistakes.

According to ENSI, 22 fuel assemblies at the plant are damaged, out of which six have been used for three to four operating cycles. Leibstadt's fuel amount consists of 648 fuel utilities, totalizing 62,000 fuel rods. Only a small number of those rods - an estimated 0.045% - suffered from quality assurance failure, according to ENSI.

Ralph Schultz, head of ENSI's safety analysis division, said: "Damage to a limited number of fuel rods is not welcome during reactor operation, but it poses no danger to humans and the environment because of the [plant's] multiple barriers and defense-in-depth,".

Leibstadt's operator is making a report regarding the incident, which will reviewed by the regulator. ENSI plans as well to execute an assessment at the manufacturer of fuel rod sleeves. ENSI did not mentioned the name of the manufacturer.
