SolarSolar plant Gaziantep has been linked to the grid in Islahiye in the Gaziantep southeastern region in Turkey and represents the biggest operational solar unit in the Turkish state.Both Wagner Solar GmbH, Germany's firm, and Turkish INO SOLAR have realized the installation of 25 MW PV facility in Turkey's Southeastern Anatolia province.

INO SOLAR designed this project for some land owners close to Islahiye in the Gaziantep area. 

The solar plant comprises 25 unlicensed photovoltaic sub-units, each 1 MW. According to Turkish legislation, solar PV projects under 1 MW do not require a license from the government. 

The project was accomplished in two stages. The first phase consisted in the commissioning of a 5-MW block last year. The other 20 MW units were accepted by local grid operator TEDAS last month and are now connected to the grid.

Turkish solar association Gunder revealed that for the first half of the year the newly installed photovoltaic electricity was approximately 550 MW, reaching a total installed PV capacity of over 1.5 GW. Unlicensed PV plants have a capacity of 1,491.7 MW. Another 500 MW was scheduled to be installed by the end of 2017.

The German producer of solar and wind-powered energy installations Juwi finalized a series of small solar power plants of a total capacity of 19.7 MW distributed to three facilities in Turkey less than a month ago.
