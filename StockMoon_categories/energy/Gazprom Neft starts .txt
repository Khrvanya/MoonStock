Oil MarketNaftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), a subsidiary of Russian oil producer Gazprom Neft. has started the building of a new EUR300 million deep conversion complex (DCC) at its Pancevo Refinery in Serbia. The new complex will be constructed with delayed coking technology. It is scheduled to be finished in 2019 and will help NIS to begin producing petroleum coke (pet coke) which is currently not done in the country. Gazprom Neft says that the project represents an important asset of the second phase of a major program to modernize NIS' refining capacity which has been operating since 2009.
 
According to Russian oil company, the deep conversion complex will have a capacity of 2,000 tonnes per day which would increase the conversion rate of the Pancevo Refinery to 99.2%. Additionally, production of high-quality diesel fuel at the Serbian refinery is expected to boost by over 38%.

Gazprom Neft CEO Alexander Dyukov revealed: "By introducing cutting-edge technological solutions, Gazprom Neft is striving to bring the group's refineries up to the highest standards globally in terms of conversion rate, energy efficiency and environmental friendliness.
 
He also said "Modernizing the oil refining complex is a key strategic objective for us, on the successful implementation of which the overall efficiency of our business largely depends. Under the unstable conditions of today's energy market, this is becoming a key factor in competitiveness."
 
After the complex starts operations, the Pancevo Refinery will terminate the production of high-sulphur fuel oil (mazut). Gazprom Neft had invested around EUR540 million in the first upgrading stage of the Pancevo refinery which resulted in the construction of a light hydrocracking and hydrotreating complex, for the production of Euro-5 fuel.

The Gazprom unit owns 56% in NIS, an oil and gas firm in which the Serbian government is the main shareholder.
