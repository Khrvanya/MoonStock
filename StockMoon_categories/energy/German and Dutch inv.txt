SolarInvestors from Germany and Holland plan to make investments in the construction of solar power plant in the South Kazakhstan area.The Kazakh representative Zhanseit Tuimebayev talked about the economic potential of the region and benefits offered to investors.
 
Meanwhile, foreign entrepreneurs mentioned about their plan to construct two solar power stations and an asphalt plant in the Maktaaral district.
 
Tuimebayev declared: "For a region with a population of about three million people, this project is very desirable and effective. Some 65 percent of the electricity we receive from outside. The need of the inhabitants of the region in summer is 350-370 MW, and in winter 450-480 MW. That's why we need to implement energy projects. The climate of our region is ideal for the production of solar power."

General Director of KADI LLP Murat Davrasov stated that the German firm NwComp Solar GmbH, which executed several projects in the country, will offer financial backing of about 7 million euros in the building of a solar power plant. The plant will be sited on the territory of the Zhetysay dustbin and will have a 4.8 MW capacity. Construction work should begin on November 2017.

The sponsor of the second project was the firm from Netherlands called VTK Invests. By now, within this program terms, a bilateral memorandum of understanding on the raising of a 100 MW solar power plant was signed. Also 300 hectares of land will be used to perform the relevant work. The cost of the project is estimated at 150 million euros. At present, the Dutch company is carrying out a similar project in the Akmola region.
