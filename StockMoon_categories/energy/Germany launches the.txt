WindNew German wind turbines, considered the tallest in the world, are now operational.Max Bogl Wind AG's four turbines represent the primary stage of a bigger alternative energy and storage project in Gaildorf, close to Stuttgart. Every year, the four wind units are likely to produce over 10GWh of power. It is enough to supply approximately 10,000 households.

By the end of 2018, its developers expect to see an integrated pumped storage power site. It is planned to deliver an extra 70MWh capacity quantified in four hours of water stored electricity. It should permit the turbines to continue producing electricity during periods when they would otherwise be throttled back or stopped, like during strong winds.

Every tower has a height of almost 178 meters, with the overall height from the ground to the tip of the blade rising to 264.5 metres.

Josef Knitl, CEO of Max Bogl Wind AG, declared: "We are proud to be able to make an important step towards the success of the energy turnaround and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions with this milestone."
