HydroRail manufacturer Alstom plans to replace the diesel vehicles of the transport authority Elbe-Weser-Verkehrsbetriebe (evb) with hydrogen-power trains from December 2021.Hydrogen-powered trains will operate completely emission-free and will commence the first passenger service in Lower Saxony. Alstom will construct an overall number of 14 fuel cell trains named Coradia iLint for the Local Transport Authority of Lower Saxony (Landesnahverkehrsgesellschaft Niedersachsen, LNVG).

The cell trains will be constructed at the Salzgitter site and are expected to service travellers between Cuxhaven, Bremerhaven, Bremervorde and Buxtehude from December 2021.

These will replace the diesel multiple units of the transport authority Elbe-Weser-Verkehrsbetriebe (evb) and will cut the pollutant emission on daily basis to zero.

The Linde Group's own filling station will provide the train with hydrogen. The Coradia iLint can cover around 1,000 kilometers with one tank filled 100%, and can stick to a maximum speed of up to 140 km/h.
