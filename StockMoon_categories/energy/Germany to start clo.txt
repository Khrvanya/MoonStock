CoalGermany plans to shut down its first power plants that use black coal in 2020, a draft law seen by Reuters on Thursday showed, as part of a planned phase-out of coal by 2038 expected to cost at least 40 billion euros ($44 billion).Black coal, also known as hard coal or anthracite, is a top grade coal with a high energy density. Lower grade brown coal, or lignite, is also used by some power plants.
 
The government will announce far-reaching steps on climate protection on Sept. 20, including details on the implementation of its coal exit, which envisages that by 2022 an estimated 12 hard coal plants would be shut down, leaving about 30 feeding some 15 gigawatts (GW) into the grid.
 
According to the Federal Environment Agency some 45 plants run either fully or partially on hard coal.
