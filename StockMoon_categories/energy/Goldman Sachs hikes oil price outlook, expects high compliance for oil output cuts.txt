  Investment bank Goldman Sachs Friday revised its crude oil price  forecast for the second quarter of 2017 on the back of a decision  by OPEC members and other countries to cut production  amid growing demand from consumers.  Goldman Sachs has upped its oil price outlook for the second  quarter of 2017 to $57.50 a barrel from $55 a barrel for U.S. West  Texas Intermediate crude. It also raised its price forecast  for international benchmark Brent crude to $59 a barrel from  $56.50 a barrel.   The investment bank's December outlook for U.S. crude however  remains at $50 a barrel as a potential ramp up in oil production  from Libya and a  limit the near-term  upside.   As for the much hyped production cuts by OPEC and major  non-OPEC producers, there will be "little evidence" of the  cuts until mid to late January, when they will be the "next  catalyst for the next large move in prices".  "Ultimately,our work on Saudi Arabia's fiscal balance suggests  that the kingdom has a strong incentive to cut production to  achieve a normalization of inventories,even if it requires a  larger unilateral cut, consistent with comments last weekend by  the energy minister. Given this incentive to cut and in light of  the OPEC and non-OPEC cuts announced over the past two weeks, we  are slightly raising the 1H17 production declines that we project  from the participating producers," the Goldman analysts wrote.  They expect 84 percent compliance to the announced collective cuts of 1.6  million barrels a day.   "Beyond H1 2017, we expect that the global market will remain  balanced, with Brent prices between $55 per barrel and $60 per  barrel, on higher production from low-cost producers, a greater  shale supply response and the continued ramp up in legacy  projects," analysts from the house added.
