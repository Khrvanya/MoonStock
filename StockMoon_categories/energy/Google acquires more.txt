RenewableGoogle purchased more power from solar and wind farms than consumed by its operations in 2017.The company announced it correlated its power use with renewables acquired worldwide.
 
Urs Holzle, Senior Vice President, Technical Infrastructure declared: "For every kilowatt-hour of energy we consume, we add a matching kilowatt-hour of renewable energy to a power grid somewhere. But that renewable energy may be produced in a different place or at a different time, from where we're running our data centres and offices. What's important to use is that we are adding new clean energy sources to the electrical system and that we're buying that renewable energy in the same amount as what we're consuming, globally and on an annual basis."
 
Google has previously signed contracts to purchase 3GW of electricity generated from renewable projects and till now, its renewable contracts have led to new capital investment estimated at more than $3 billion (PS2 billion).
