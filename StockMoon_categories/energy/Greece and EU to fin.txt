CoalHellenic energy minister declared on Wednesday that Greece and the European Union are likely to end discussions on which coal-fired plants the country will put up for sale according to an EU court decision this month.European court considers that PPC, 51% controlled by state, had abused its monopolistic role in the coal market. In these terms, Greece officials and its international granters have agreed that the company will sell plants estimated to around 40 percent of its coal-fired capacity.

George Stathakis, Energy minister met PPC's biggest labor union and declared that negotiations with EU's competition authorities were continuing and should finalize in the next couple of weeks. "Our aim is to find common ground," he said, according to a statement from the energy ministry.

Athens and the European Commission representatives have been in discussions since July, trying to decide which sites are more suitable for sale. Greece wishes to get rid of the energy units that will not essentially reduce PPC's generation capacity. The EU wants to make sure that the sites will attract investors' interest. Under its recent bailout, the Hellenic state also needs to limit PPC's share of the retail market to less than 50 percent from 88 % by the end of 2019.

Greece started electricity sales with the aim to open the power market for other producers, but the measure has been ineffective by now. PPC suggested to shift about seven percent of its customers to an entity, targeting its sale to investors in order to reduce its dominant influence. Nevertheless, Greece does not have intentions to sell any of PPC's clients, as stated by Stathakis.
