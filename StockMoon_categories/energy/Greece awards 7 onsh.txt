WindThe Greek Regulatory Authority for Energy (RAE) has awarded seven wind projects with a total capacity of 171 megawatts (MW) in the country's first onshore wind auction, WindEurope said Thursday.The price range of the winning bids was EUR68-EUR72 per megawatt-hour (MWh), with the weighted average price coming in at EUR69.53/MWh, the association said in a press release.
 
It noted that the auction was oversubscribed, with 14 wind projects with a total capacity of 308 MW bidding in.
 
Of the winning bids, four projects are in Northern Greece, two in the center of the country and one on the island of Andros, the statement said.
 
Greek daily Ekathimerini said the domestic players appeared "unprepared" for the entry of foreign investors who offered "considerably lower and clearly more competitive rates".
 
"In wind power projects, the bids made in the context of the tenders were 22.7 percent below the starting price, while in photovoltaics the prices were 20.2 percent lower," the daily said in a report published late Wednesday.
 
According to the report, the lowest prices (between EUR62.97 and EUR62.99 MWh) in photovoltaics came from the subsidiaries of German group ABO, which secured five projects with a total capacity of 45 MW out of a total auctioned capacity of 53 MW.
 
"Portugal's EDP was also aggressive," Ekathimerini said, adding its Renovaveis subsidiary participated in the wind projects tenders, and offered a price of EUR68.18/MWh after a starting price of EUR90/MWh, securing a 44.6 MW wind park.
 
Greece had announced plans in May to auction 2.6 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2020, in addition to the 2.6 GW already installed in the country.
