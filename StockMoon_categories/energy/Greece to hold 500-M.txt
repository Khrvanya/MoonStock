RenewableGreece will hold an online auction on April 2, 2020, to contract about 500 MW of renewable energy generating capacity, the country's Regulatory Authority for Energy (RAE) announced on Thursday.According to the newly-released terms and conditions of the tender, the maximum allowed bid price is set at EUR 61.32 (USD 67.8) per MWh, which compares to the EUR-64.72/MWh ceiling price in the prior technology-neutral auction in Greece that was held a year earlier.
 
The process is open to wind projects with individual capacities exceeding 50 MW and solar projects above 20 MW. Interested parties can submit applications by February 25.
 
In last year's mixed-technology renewable energy tender, RAE awarded 437.78 MW of power generating capacity, almost half of which (204 MWp) was won by the local unit of German project developer Juwi AG.
