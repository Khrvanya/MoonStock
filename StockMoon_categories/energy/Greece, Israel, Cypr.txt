Natural GasThe governments of Greece, Israel and Cyprus have signed an agreement to build a pipeline that could supply Europe with 4 percent of its annual gas needs by the middle of the decade.The agreement is a statement of political will, but it is now up to the construction consortium, led by the Public Gas Corporation of Greece (DEPA) and Italy's Edison, to find the roughly six billion euros ($6.7bn) the pipeline is estimated to cost.
 
East Med would stretch almost 1,900 kilometres (1,181 miles) from Israeli and Cypriot gas fields in the eastern Mediterranean to Italy via Greece.
 
It would initially carry 10 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas a year but could expand to twice that with the latest compression technology.
 
DEPA took the first step towards making East Med viable on Thursday by pledging to buy 2bcm of Israeli gas a year, which it feels it can sell on to European gas distributors.
