RenewableThe electricity produced from renewables will be cheaper than the electricity generated from coal in four years, mainly in Europe.   
At the 2nd International Association for Energy Economics (IAEE) Eurasian Conference, former Bulgarian environment minister Julian Popov told that according to EU law, the recently established Large Combustion Plants need high standards for the industry emission. He stated that power plants should limit their emissions if the thermal capacity is equal or more than 50 megawatts.
 
Popov explained that it will be hard to obtain levelized electricity cost under EUR8 per MWh, if new coal power plants are built with the latest technology.
 
He further mentioned that some challenges of renewables related to the variability and grid connection can be successfully managed in the future.
