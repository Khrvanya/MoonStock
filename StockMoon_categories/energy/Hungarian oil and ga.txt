Oil MarketHungarian oil giant MOL declared about its intentions to sell its assets off the UK causing continuous tensed events in the North Sea. This comes after four years the company entered the area.MOL had chosen Bank of America to control the sale process covering a portfolio estimated at low hundreds of millions of dollars. This portfolio includes a stake of 20 percent of the enormous Catcher field which Premier Oil and Cairn Energy companies likely to bring into work soon. 

It is considered that the Hungarian firm has lost interest in the UK North Sea after the sharp decline in oil price since 2014 weighed on margins. 

MOL purchased several UK North Sea assets from Germany's Wintershall paying PS280 million in 2013, when activity was expanding in the region. Many companies were striving to boost North Sea production to capitalize on a long period of increased oil prices. After growth in supplies ran well ahead of demand, this came to an end. 

Some big petroleum companies have sold North Sea assets since 2014, to direct their investment on areas they consider offer better expansion perspectives. 

Private equity investors have underlined opportunities to acquire assets at more attractive prices. Shell sold a portfolio estimated at half of its UK energy generation to private equity funded by Chrysaor in January for around $3.8 billion.
