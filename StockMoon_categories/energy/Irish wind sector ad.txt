WindThe Irish wind sector recorded a record year in 2019 after developers added 463MW of new capacity and provided a third of the country's electricity demand, according to new figures.The Irish Wind Energy Association's annual report said the 12-month haul was the industry's second-best for new connections and the 32.5% share of the power mix is the second-best in Europe.
 
Some 24 new wind farms were completed bringing the country's total wind capacity to 4.1GW.
 
IWEA chief executive David Connolly said: "Wind energy in Ireland is going from strength to strength. Every year we are cutting more CO2 emissions, reducing Ireland's dependency on imported fossil fuels and driving down the wholesale price of electricity.
 
"The two dozen new wind farms we connected last year will enable us to build on our success in 2019 and we have already set new records for the amount of wind energy on the system in the first two months of 2020."
 
However, Connolly warned there is growing concern over the amount of lost wind energy, which hit 8% in 2019.
