Natural GasIsrael, Cyprus, Greece and Italy are expected to sign an intergovernmental agreement for the EU-backed EastMed pipeline project in March to transport natural gas from Israel's Leviathan field and Cypriot fields via Crete to Italy, and then onward to the rest of Europe.According to the European Commission, EastMed is a PCI (Project of Common Interest) in the current 3rd union list of PCIs. They have received a Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) grant to carry out a number of studies. "They applied to the 4th list the preparation of which is on-going. Adoption is foreseen by the Commission in late 2019," a Commission spokeswoman told New Europe on February 22.
 
Meanwhile, the exact announcement date for the signing of the intergovernmental agreement is expected to follow an announcement reportedly this week by US energy giant ExxonMobil and Qatar Petroleum of the results from two-test drills offshore Cyprus for hydrocarbons. Media has speculated that ExxonMobil could announce a "sizeable find" similar to Egypt's Zohr in Block 10 following exploration drills at wells Delphine-1 and Glafcos-1 in Cyprus' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
