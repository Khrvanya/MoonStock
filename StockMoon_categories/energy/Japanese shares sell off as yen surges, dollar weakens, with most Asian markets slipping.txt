  Wall Street's fresh record closing highs failed to boost  sentiment in Asia markets on Tuesday, with Japanese shares  selling off as the yen surged.  The benchmark  fell 273.05 points, or 1.62 percent, to  16,596.51, while the broader Topix dropped 18.16 points, or 1.38  percent, to 1,298.47.   The Japanese  yen traded as high as 100.14 against the dollar,  compared with levels above 101.00 on Monday. As of 2:14 p.m.  HK/SIN, the dollar/yen pair traded at 100.23.   In Australia, the benchmark ASX 200 slipped 7.96 points, or 0.14  percent, to 5,532.00, with the energy and gold sub-indexes  beating the broader index to advance 1.09 and 1.3 percent,  respectively. Offsetting those gains, the heavily weighted  financials sub-index shed 0.26 percent.  In South Korea, the Kospi returned to trading after being shut on Monday for  a public holiday, with the index finishing down 2.71 points, or  0.13 percent, at 2,047.76. In Hong Kong, the  was flat at  22,937 in late afternoon trade.  Chinese mainland markets were mixed, with the  composite closing down 14.71  points, or 0.47 percent, at 3,110.47, while the Shenzhen composite gained  13.56 points, or 0.67 percent, to 2,036.80.   Analysts told CNBC on Tuesday that the yen could see further  strength in the coming weeks amid signs the market may be losing confidence in the Bank of Japan's ability to use  monetary policy to give Japan's moribund economy a leg up.   Manpreet Gill, head of FICC investment strategy at Standard  Chartered Wealth Management, told CNBC's "Capital Connection" that investors  should be cautious on Japanese assets across the board in a  strong yen environment.  "What a dollar/yen at 100, or potentially lower, is telling us is  the market does not believe that the Bank of Japan is likely to  be successful in reflating the economy," Gill said. "This could  eventually lead to more extreme policy events down the line, but  in the short term, it's quite possible the dollar/yen moves lower  rather than higher."  Another analyst pointed to the central bank's disappointing  monetary policy move last month, where the BOJ said it would only  increase its purchase of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), while  keeping interest rates unchanged, resulted in the underlying yen strength  "asserting itself now."   "In the first and second quarters, the yen strength was because of the unwinding of  the long Nikkei, long Japanese trade [positions], as global  investors ... unwound the currency hedge and bought the yen," KH  Heng, senior foreign exchange strategist at Credit Suisse Private  Banking told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Tuesday.   "Now the problem is, we're entering the second leg. As the yen  continues to strengthen, the Japanese lifers [insurance  companies] are caught in a catch-22. The hedge ratios are very  low for currencies," Heng said. He added for Japanese insurance  companies, if they expect the yen to strengthen further to levels  near 95, then they would buy more yen to hedge  their bets.  Heng added given the yen's natural bias is to strengthen, the  long term fair value of the currency could be around 93 or 94  against the dollar.   Japanese exporters sold off on Tuesday,  with Toyota shares down 1.26  percent, Nissan down 1.73 percent  and Nikon off 2.83 percent. Fujitsu  shares bucked the trend, closing up 2.88 percent.   In the commodities space, oil prices pulled back during Asian  hours after extending their rally on Monday.   Global benchmark Brent was down 0.83 percent at  $47.95 a barrel, after advancing 2.9 percent  overnight. U.S. crude futures were down  0.79 percent at $45.38, after rising 2.8 percent on  Monday.   Energy plays in Asia closed mostly higher, with Santos gaining 2.51  percent and Woodside Petroleum up 0.95  percent, but Inpex closed down 1.03 percent,  after erasing a gain of more than 2 percent following the yen's surge.    Sentiment toward oil was likely boosted by speculation that the  world's oil producers might finally move to tackle the global  supply glut, with prices likely getting an additional fillip from  data showing a drawdown in U.S. crude inventory.   Reuters reported data from market intelligence firm Genscape  estimated a drawdown of more than 350,000 barrels at the Cushing,  Oklahoma delivery point for U.S. crude last week.   "The levity seen in oil prices spread throughout the rest of the  commodity complex, assisted by some U.S. dollar weakness," said  Angus Nicholson, a market analyst at brokerage firm  IG.   But chances of global producers agreeing to actions to reduce  their oil production appeared minimal, especially during  September's OPEC meeting.  "The Saudis are happy to commit to some sort of OPEC-wide supply  freeze deal so long as Iran is party to it. And Iran refuses to  agree to any deal that will inhibit them from lifting their oil  output to pre-sanctions level," said Nicholson.    In the currency market, the dollar weakened, trading at 95.093  against a basket of currencies as of 2:51 p.m. HK/SIN, compared  with levels above 96.00 early last week and an earlier session  high of 95.659.   Analysts attributed the greenback's swoon to San Francisco  Federal Reserve President John Williams' comments on Monday in  his regional Fed letter pushing for broad policy changes by  governments and central banks and advocating for higher inflation  targets amid concerns over persistently low interest rates.   "The market view is that the odds of a rate hike are again  lengthening," said Patrick Bennett, a strategist at CIBC, in a note Tuesday.  The British  pound strengthened against the dollar in the afternoon  session, trading at $1.2910 as of 2:47 p.m. HK/SIN. Earlier, the  pound traded as low as $1.2872, levels not seen since  1985, amid expectations the Bank of England would likely take  further easing steps in the months ahead.     In company news, Reuters reported the China Evergrande Group raised  its stake to nearly 7 percent in the country's biggest home  builder, China  Vanke. Evergrande purchased another 2.14 percent stake in  Vanke for $823 million, Reuters said citing a regulatory filing  to the Hong Kong stock exchange.   Shenzhen-listed shares of Vanke were up 10.02 percent, while Hong  Kong listed shares of China Vanke were up 2.93 percent. Shares of  China Evergrande added 1.02 percent.  After the Australian market close, major miner BHP Billiton  reported its worst loss ever, coming in $6.39 billion in the red for the year ended June 30, swinging from a profit of $1.91 billion a year earlier. The company said it is determined to pay a final divided of 14 U.S. cents, fully franked, per share for the current period.   BHP's losses were attributed to a combination of factors  including lower commodity prices and settlement costs for  a dam disaster  in Brazil that caused multiple casualties.   BHP shares closed the Australian trading session up 0.45  percent to 20.25 Australian dollars.   Stateside, all three indexes set record closing highs for a  second time in a week. The  rose 0.32  percent to 18,636.05, while the S&P 500 index closed 0.28 percent  higher at 2,190.15. The  composite rose 0.56 percent to  5,262.02.— Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.
