  Crude oil companies could face more pain in the next decade, as  producers may not cut contributions to an already oversupplied market, short seller Jim Chanos contended  Thursday.  The Kynikos Associates founder noted he was short most "major  leveraged oil companies." While he did not give a specific  prediction for the price of oil, Chanos contended OPEC may not slow  production, keeping supply high.   "If I was a member of OPEC, I'd be pumping as much as I could  today while it's worth something because it might not be worth a whole lot by 2030," he told CNBC's "Closing Bell."

West Texas Intermediate and  Brent crude prices have both fallen more than 40 percent this  year, putting pressure on companies' balance sheets and dividends.   Chanos' bets against the energy space have focused on more than  oil companies. He still holds a short position in SolarCity,  shares of which rose this week after lawmakers agreed to a deal to  extend investment tax credits beyond 2016.   "I wish I could borrow more" stock to short SolarCity despite the rally, Chanos  said. He criticized the company's model rather than the solar  industry overall. SolarCity did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Disclaimer
