  Job growth probably slowed in November, but it was not likely to  have been sluggish enough to stop the Fed from raising interest rates this month.  Friday's jobs report is one of the most anticipated employment  reports of the year — the most important data the Fed will  see before it meets Dec. 15 and 16 to consider its first rate  hike in nine years.  Economists expect 200,000 nonfarm payrolls and an unchanged  unemployment rate of 5 percent, after a surprisingly strong  271,000 new jobs last month. They also expect average hourly  wages to rise 0.2 percent, after a surprise jump of 0.4 percent  in October.   Besides the jobs number, markets are also watching the oil market  after two volatile days. OPEC is meeting in Vienna Friday and  while it is not expected to cut production, reports that it might  helped drive oil prices higher Thursday and Friday after Wednesday's sharp sell-off. Saudi Arabia's oil minister knocked down the idea of production cuts Friday, while Venezuela warned of $20 oil if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries does not cut back.
