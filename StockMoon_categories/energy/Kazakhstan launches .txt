CO2Kazakhstan has just launched an online platform to monitor, report and verify emissions sources and greenhouse gases.The platform is an essential element of the National Emissions Trading System, which was launched in 2013 as the country's main tool to regulate domestic CO2 emissions. It enables Kazakhstan's major emitters to send and record data on GHGs emissions as well as trade online. 

The National Allocation Plan, adopted in January 2018, establishes an emission cap for 129 companies for 2018-2020.

Ato Brown, World Bank Country Manager for Kazakhstan declared: "Kazakhstan's emissions trading system is the first of its kind in the Central Asia region. With support from the Partnership for Market Readiness, the country has made a great effort to develop policy options for mid- and long-term emissions pathways and to develop an action plan on GHG emissions reductions by 2030."

The platform was developed by JSC Zhasyl Damu and supported by France's Technical Centre on Air Pollution and Greenhouse Gases.
