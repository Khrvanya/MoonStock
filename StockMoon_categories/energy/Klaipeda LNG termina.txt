LNGSecurity of supply in Lithuania has been assured through the country's LNG terminal in Klaipeda, according to Jusius Mindaugas, CEO of LNG operator Klaipedos Nafta. Over a half of Lithuania's total gas imports in 2016 came via the Klapeida terminal.

The unit is currently functioning with high capacity. The reason the terminal was created is the security of supply, offering Lithuanians the possibility to access freely LNG in different locations all over the world. 

During the year, the Baltic nation obtained four cargoes from continents such as North America, South America, Europe and Africa.

Vytautas Cekanavicius, CEO of Litgas speaking at the 9th Baltic Energy Summit in Lithuania's capital Vilnius affirmed that the worst times have already passed for Lithuania in terms of security of energy supplies as the country imports LNG since December 2014 to cut its reliance on Russian gas.

The Litgas official also declared: "The times when we were paying high prices for gas to Russia is also over. Our companies are looking for alternatives. What we see is that during the last three years, consumption is quite stable." Also, he emphasized that this achievement came with hard effort as well as months of negotiation convincing LNG suppliers to involve in trade. He added that trade in spot transactions is possible now and is much easier.

At present, Lithuania's gas demand accounts for 2.5 billion cubic meters while the LNG terminal obtains its primary cargo from Norway. In 2012, the country's needs were higher, the gas demand being estimated at 3 billion cubic meters.
