  Kuwaiti oil and gas workers have ended a three-day strike that  had temporarily cut the OPEC member's crude production by nearly  half, the trade union said in a statement posted on its Twitter  account.   "In honor of his highness the Emir ... we have decided the  following. First, the cancellation of the general strike and the  attendance of all oil sector workers at their places of work  beginning at seven in the morning on Wednesday 20 April 2016,"  the Oil & Petrochemicals Industries Workers Confederation  wrote.   The union further pledged "to make every effort to immediately  return production to its previous level."   News of the strike's end came just hours after Kuwait's oil  minister had ruled out negotiations with the employees until they  stopped their action, while one of the union leaders said the  thousands of workers would hold out until planned public sector  pay cuts were canceled.   U.S. oil prices fell slightly after the news. Oil markets had  rallied this week as the strike forced Kuwait Oil Company (KOC)  to cut output to as little as 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd),  down from a normal level of about 3 million bpd. By Tuesday  output had recovered to around 1.5 million bpd.   Workers fear reduced salaries, benefits and staff layoffs will be  part of a planned government overhaul of the payroll system in  the public sector.    In an interview with Kuwaiti TV channel al-Rai, Kuwait's acting  oil minister, Anas al-Saleh, said production would continue and  that no talks would proceed during a strike.   "We cannot sit down at the negotiating table with the unions  during a strike. We will achieve the impossible to continue to  operate the oil sector despite the strike," Saleh said.   Unions had not said how long the walkout would last. Non-Kuwaiti  oil workers are not on strike.  Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.
