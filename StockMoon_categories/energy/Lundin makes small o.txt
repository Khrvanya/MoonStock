Oil MarketThe discovery was made at the wildcat well 16/5-8 S, in the production license 815, about 14 kilometers south of the Edvard Grieg field in the central part of the Norwegian sector of the North Sea.The primary exploration target for well 16/5-8 S was to prove petroleum in fractured and weathered granitic basement rock and to verify pressure communication with the 16/1-12 (Rolvsnes) oil discovery.
 
According to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the well hit a potential oil column of about 20 meters in fractured, weathered basement rock, with poor reservoir quality.
 
Preliminary estimates place the size of the discovery between 0.2 and 1.6 million Sm3 recoverable oil. Pressure data shows that the discovery is not in pressure communication with the 16/1-12 (Rolvsnes) oil discovery.
 
Lundin has also issued a statement in which it said: "The preliminary gross resources from this well are estimated to be between 1 and 10 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe), however there is clear upside potential in the larger Goddo area and surrounding prospective basement."
