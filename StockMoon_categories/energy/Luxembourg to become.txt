RenewableAt the COP23 summit held in Bonn, Luxembourg's finance and environment ministers met directors of the European Investment Bank to discuss about the institution of a de-risking mechanism to allow the financial backing of ecologically-friendly projects. Luxembourg is a very small country but releases a big amount of emissions and wants to become less polluting.Carole Dieschbourg, Minister of the Environment declared: "We stick to our commitment on renewables but also on emission reductions. At the moment, we will be able to meet our objectives to be coherent with the objectives of the Kyoto protocol for the emission reduction. We are on track". 

Within the framework of the EU's renewable energy directive, states propose their individual renewable energy goals. Luxembourg made a decision that by 2020, 11% of all energy used should derive from green sources. 

Luxembourg recently signed an accord with Lithuania to purchase the Baltic state's surplus wind electricity data and relies on it in reaching its own objective.

Pierre Gramegna, the finance minister of the Grand Duchy affirmed regarding Luxembourg's presidency of Eurogroup: "We are not there for the Eurogroup yet, but I think that green bonds and green finance are key topics that all countries should be interested in. And by having the European Investment Bank on board, we already have a very important European touch to the whole initiative."

The European Investment Bank has a record of enhancing the financial aid. Under the Juncker plan, from initial funding of EUR10 billion, the bank was capable to receive additional investments totaling EUR180 billion to support economies in the Europe. The move from grants to loans has been a priority of the Juncker leadership.
