Natural GasMoldova does not plan to negotiate a new gas contract with  Gazprom but will wait instead for construction of a link to the European energy network, Interfax quoted Moldovan Economy Minister Chiril Gaburici as telling a television talkshow.Chisinau's current contract with Gazprom was signed in 2008 and runs until the end of 2019. Gaburici said construction of the Ungheni-Chisinau pipeline, running from the Romanian border to the Moldovan capital, would begin by the end of August, as Moldova tries to break its energy dependence on Russia.
 
Interfax said construction could take 10 months, but Romania's ambassador to Chisinau, Daniel Ionita, has previously said it could take until January 2020.
 
<<The current contract has been repeatedly extended, and it will be in effect until the end of 2019. Therefore, we will not negotiate a new contract with Gazprom for the timebeing,>> Gaburici was quoted as saying on TVC21. <<We really want to see alternative gas available as soon as possible,>> he said. <<There will be competition and everyone will fight for us as a client and offer us better prices.>>
 
Moldova currently pays about $175 US per 1,000 m3 of gas though the price is calculated quarterly. The current Gazprom deal was signed by then communist PM Zinaida Greceanii, now leader of the pro-Russian Socialist Party of Moldova, PSRM.
