CO2The International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) welcomed the Chinese government's inauguration of its national emissions trading system (ETS) putting an end to a busy year for developments in the carbon market globally.Initially, China's ETS would cover only electricity and heat generators, representing CO2 emissions of around 3 billion tons, as announced by the National Development and Reform Commission. 

A preliminary assessment period of 12 months is likely before the allocation is finished.

Dirk Forrister, president and CEO of IETA, affirmed that China is joining an increasing number of jurisdictions, such as California, the EU and South Korea in their pursuit to reduce emissions. 

He also iterated that these nations are using market-based measures to limit climate emissions in a financially effective and efficient way.

Forrister declared: "China will have the world's largest carbon market, drawing lessons from these other markets to ensure that it works in harmony with other national policies. We commend the Chinese government for taking these steps to realize its long-term vision."

The recent ETS Status Report, the International Carbon Action Partnership said that approximately half of the world's GDP would be used in the emissions trading market by the end of 2017.
