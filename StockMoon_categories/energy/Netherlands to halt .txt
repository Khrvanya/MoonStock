Netherlands to halt Groningen gas production by 2022

Natural GasThe Netherlands will halt production at Groningen, Europe's largest onshore natural gas field, by 2022, eight years earlier than initially planned, the Dutch government said on Tuesday.Groningen produced nearly 54 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas in 2013 before tremors blamed on drilling damaged buildings and prompted a series of lowered caps on output and protests by residents and campaigners.
 
An unusually strong earthquake in January 2018 prompted the government last year to promise to end production by 2030.
 
But Economy Minister Eric Wiebes last month signalled the end could come a lot sooner, citing greater capacity to convert high calorific imported gas to the low calorific standard of Groningen gas and a switch by large industrial users to other sources of energy.
 
These measures will enable production to fall to zero by mid 2022, assuming average weather conditions, Wiebes said on Tuesday.
