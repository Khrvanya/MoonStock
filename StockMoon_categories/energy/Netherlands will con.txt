WindVattenfall won a tender granted by the Dutch Government to build the first commissioned offshore wind farm without public funding, as stated by WindEurope on Tuesday.The twin 350-megawatt Hollandse Kust Zuid offshore wind parks will be constructed by 2022.

Offshore wind expenses in Europe have been declining sharply in recent years as manufacturers bring even larger turbines to the market.

The German offshore tender represented the first event where zero-subsidy bids won.

Following the German tender, the Dutch Government agreed on offers from any developer prepared to claim a zero-subsidy bid.

Giles Dickson, CEO of WindEurope said that this example demonstrates that zero-subsidy offers are possible for several developers in some markets not least where governments take on and run a part of the project risk.

He also declared: "Wind energy is showing again and again that it can deliver ever more capacity for less cash. That's the key message other governments should take from this: they should revise their ambition upwards in their national energy plans and offshore wind is a great way to help them do this."
