EnergyThe carbon floor price to be introduced from 2020 by the new Dutch coalition government will be 18 euros/tonne of CO2 released in the energy sector, as told by a Dutch lawmaker.  
"The Netherlands is introducing a CO2 floor price in the electricity sector. As from 2020, the price per metric ton of CO2 emitted in that sector will be 18 euros/tonne. This figure will rise to 43 euros/tonne in 2030," Stientje van Veldhoven, an lawmaker from the liberal D66 party, component of Prime Minister Mark Rutte's third coalition, said it in an email.

EUA carbon allowances are presently sold above 7 euros/tonne, but these are expected to increase amid the projected reform of the EU's Emission Trading Scheme from 2020.
 
The introduction of a carbon floor price will boost generation costs for the five remaining Dutch coal plants more than for gas-fired plants because of their higher carbon intensity, serving for a raise in coal-to-gas switching in the Dutch market.

Increased Dutch prices would also have an impact on cross-border streams if the measures are completed by Germany or Belgium, and might also extend Germany's oldest coal plants, letting undecided the coal and carbon measures applied in Germany.
 
In the Netherlands, the pressure on coal plants to shut down before the scheduled 2030 deadline will be stronger for the two remaining older units (RWE's 600-MW Amer 9 and Vattenfall's 650-MW Hemweg 8) after actions taken, such as a prior "coal tax", connected to plant effectiveness led to the closure of most of coal units over recent years.

According to Dutch statistics office CBS, carbon emissions are now 11% lower from 1990. The Dutch government should reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% compared to 1990 levels by 2020 year, where the new coalition agreement for Rutte III is targeting 49% cut by 2030 but with no peculiar aims for 2020 for now.
