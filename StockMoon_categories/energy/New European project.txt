CO2European Union launched a new project designed for reducing and reusing CO2 in industrial processes. Researchers from all the Europe have united their efforts to face high-level carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) in peculiar industrial zones.The project's name is 'Accelerating low carbon industrial growth through CCUS' (ALIGN-CCUS) and its purpose is to support large scale and cost-effective implementation of CCUS by 2025.

The project will be implemented by companies with intensive industrial activity in five European nations:  Teesside and Grangemouth in the UK, Rotterdam in the Netherlands, North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, Grenland in Norway and Oltenia in Romania.

The British Geological Survey (BGS) will contribute essentially to the UK project, concentrating on the storage of huge scale provision networks and UK case studies to lower the cost of CCUS deployment at the Teesside and Grangemouth industrial firm groups.

Professor John Ludden, Executive Director of the BGS declared: "The ALIGN-CCUS project is a real opportunity to enable heavy industries to decarbonise and thereby meet the growing demands from their customers to offer greener products in the future."
