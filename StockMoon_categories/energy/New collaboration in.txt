RenewableEnvision Energy has united forces with the UK's Met Office, the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and Aarhus University in establishing a new partnership to advance research in renewable energy forecasting. Parties pledge to work on the new methods and technologies for the fulfillment of the project.Improving prediction models can lead to more accurate energy resource evaluations and enhance the ability of the grid to plan for renewable energy inputs.

The preliminary stage of the research partnership has concentrated on improving wind and solar production forecast accuracy utilizing scientific data, models, algorithms and supercomputing technologies.

Successive research phases will cover improved forecasting services for electricity grids, e-mobility and enhanced energy management for buildings, industrial microgrids and smart cities.

Arwel Griffiths, Business Group Director at the Met Office affirmed: "The increasing accuracy of wind and solar forecasts have direct benefits to the energy industry, including more efficient utilisation of national grid infrastructure as a result of the increasing take-up of renewable energy resources on a global basis."
