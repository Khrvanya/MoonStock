Oil MarketNigeria is the single member country in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, that imports petroleum, mentioned by the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Dr. Maikanti Baru, at the 2018 Oloibiri Lecture Series (OLEF) in Abuja.Maikanti Baru, Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), declared: "As we speak today, Nigeria is the only OPEC country that imports petrol and we are the largest importer of PMS in the world. We actually import one million tonnes of PMS every month into a country that produces oil and gas and has refinery. It is a shameful thing, it doesn't make sense and that is what we are trying to address."

The official iterated that the refineries had not been functioning at maximum capacity, but that the NNPC was working to tackle these challenges with the imminent announcement of investors who would financially back the reparation of the plants.

The goal is to upgrade refineries from 445,000 barrels of crude oil per day to at least 1million barrel per day. Talks with pertinent investors and financiers are continuing. Refineries are expected to be completely operational by December 2019.
