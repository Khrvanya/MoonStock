Asian markets were mixed on Wednesday, as sentiment hit from a lower finish on Wall Street offset the positive impact of a rise in oil prices. Australia's benchmark ASX 200 closed nearly flat at 5.535.00, retracing earlier losses of nearly 0.4 percent, with the energy and materials sub-indexes advancing 1.91 and 0.83 percent, respectively. In New Zealand, the NZX 50 closed up 44.35 points, or 0.6 percent, at 7,355.02.   Japanese shares led gains across the board, with the  index finishing up 149.13 points, or 0.9 percent, at 16,745.64, while the Topix advanced 12.66 points, or 0.97 percent, to 1,311.13. Across the Korean  Strait, the Kospi fell 4.01 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,043.75. In Hong Kong, the  erased earlier gains, slipping 0.29 percent by late afternoon. Mainland Chinese markets ended a tad higher. The  composite edged up 0.19 point, or 0.01 percent, to 3110.23, while the Shenzhen composite added 0.317 percent, or 6.47 points, to 2043.28. On Tuesday, China announced plans to open its Shenzhen stock market to foreign investors, after the State  Council said the government had approved plans for the launch of  the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect.   The program, which was modeled after the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock  Connect, would allow Shenzhen-based investors to buy Hong  Kong-listed stocks and vice versa.  Analysts said the approval of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock  Connect was part of China's efforts to open up its financial  sector to make it more competitive by international  standards.   "Although the markets had expected an announcement after the  successful conclusion of some technical issues recently, the  Shenzhen-Hong Kong connect is an exorcism of the fall-out from  the margin financed collapse of mainland stocks in 2015,"  strategists Sean Darby, Kenneth Chan and Irene Zhou from  Jefferies, said in a note to clients.   The strategists added that alongside China's on-going reform of  monetary policy tools and opening of the bond market, the  approval of the stock connect "ought to assuage investors that  financial reforms are still very much on the agenda, despite some  recent tightening of the capital account." The new program could spur foreign interest in Shenzhen shares, analysts said.  HSBC Singapore's senior vice president for renminbi Internationalization, Sunil Hiranandani, said the new trading  link will introduce global investors to "China's new generation  of Shenzhen-listed private sector companies, which include an  array of innovative internet and technology players based in the  Pearl River Delta."   He added it would also provide a "thrust for continued  internalization of the renminbi."   In the currency market, the Japanese yen weakened against the dollar  in the afternoon session, trading at 100.95 as of 2:26 p.m.  HK/SIN. The yen touched an earlier session high of 100.14 and  overnight, it climbed to levels around 99.68 to the dollar before  retreating. That compared with levels above 101.00 last week.  Analysts told CNBC on Tuesday they expect further yen strength in the near  future, following the market's disappointment with the Bank  of Japan's (BOJ) stimulus plans.  "Without the Federal Reserve Board doing the heavy lifting (with  a U.S. interest rate hike) and with the Japanese economy  seemingly immune to monetary and fiscal stimulus, it will take  little more than a few consecutive session probes below 100 yen  for traders to be hotly testing the BOJ's resolve, while knocking  on the post-Brexit spot level at 99.02 yen," said Stephen Innes,  a senior trader at OANDA.   The relatively weaker currency likely gave Japanese manufacturers  some support during the trading session, with Toyota shares advancing 2.23  percent, Honda up 3.38 percent  and Canon up 1.27 percent. Sharp shares were up 16.53  percent, after Taiwanese manufacturer Hon Hai completed its  acquisition of the Japanese electronics maker earlier this week,  following regulatory approval from China's antitrust body.   Elsewhere, the dollar fell against a basket of currencies, trading at 94.93 at 3:47 p.m. HK/SIN, off an earlier session low of 94.725, but still below the levels above 95.00 during Asian hours on  Tuesday.  "Investors dumped U.S. dollars today, pushing the greenback lower  against all of the major currencies," said Kathy Lien, managing  director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management, in  a note late Tuesday.  "Fed Presidents [William] Dudley and [Dennis] Lockhart warned  that the market is underpricing tightening and rates could rise  this year ... yet based on the price action of the dollar,  investors are not buying what [they] are saying," Lien said,  adding the market was looking instead at soft U.S. data and using  them as "arguments for why rates will remain unchanged this  year."  Reuters reported Tuesday New York Fed President Dudley and  Atlanta Fed chief Lockhart both said in public statements that  the Fed could raise short-term interest rates at  its September policy meeting.   In the commodities space, oil prices slipped again during Asian  hours on Wednesday, after advancing nearly 2 percent on Tuesday,  supported likely by further OPEC news and a relatively weaker  dollar.  Global benchmark Brent slipped 0.75 percent to $48.86 a barrel by 3:47 p.m. HK/SIN,  after climbing 1.8 percent overnight. U.S. crude futures dropped 0.67 percent to $46.27, following a 1.8 percent advance on Tuesday.  Energy plays across the region traded higher, with Santos up 0.82  percent, Oil  Search gaining 2.44 percent and Woodside Petroleum up 2.35  percent. In Japan, Inpex shares advanced 6.46 percent,  while Japan  Petroleum was up 4.33 percent.   Reuters, citing sources at OPEC, reported that Saudi Arabia wants  higher oil prices, which lent further credibility to speculation  over possible OPEC action.  In company news, shares of BHP Billiton advanced 3.26 percent on the  Australian market, following a 0.67 percent gain in London, as  investors appeared to have been comforted by a  better-than-expected underlying profit print despite the mining  company reporting a record loss.  BHP, which announced its earnings on Tuesday after the Australian  market close, said it posted a record $6.4 billion annual  loss  due to a slump in commodities and a dam  disaster in Brazil.   Australian biotechnology firm CSL reported net profit after tax of  $1.24 billion for the full year ended June 30, slipping from  $1.38 billion booked in the previous year. Profit was dragged by  CSL's acquisition of a money-losing flu vaccine business from  Novartis.   Underlying net profit after tax, excluding the loss from the  Novartis flu vaccine acquisition, was up 5.2 percent.   Investors, however, appeared unimpressed, as CSL shares sold off  5.06 percent on Wednesday.   Hong Kong airline carrier Cathay Pacific Airways' shares tumbled 7.31 percent in  afternoon trade, after Reuters reported the company's first-half  net profit tumbled 82 percent to 353 million Hong Kong dollars  ($45.52 million) amid slower growth in China and a drop in  consumer demand for premium class seats on long-haul  flights. Stateside, the  slipped 84.03 points,  or 0.45 percent, to 18,552.02; the S&P 500 index ended 12  points, or 0.55 percent, lower at 2,178.15 and the  fell 34.90  points, or 0.66 percent, to 5,227.11.   — Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.
