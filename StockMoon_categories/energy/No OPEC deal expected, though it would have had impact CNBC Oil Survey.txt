  OPEC producers could have a significant impact on oil prices if  they agree to a production freeze, but it's unlikely they'll get  it done at this week's meeting in Algiers, according to a new  CNBC Oil Survey.  Sixty-five percent of the survey respondents said no agreement is  likely, while 52 percent said if producers could strike a  deal, there would be a meaningful effect on crude prices. That may be because little more than half of the  participants also said they believe the rebalancing of oil supply  and demand is occurring more slowly than they had expected.  About 90 percent of the survey respondents believe West Texas  Intermediate oil prices will be above $40 per barrel at the end  of the year, with nearly 40 percent expecting them between $50 and  $59 per barrel. Fifty-seven percent expect oil prices to remain  stable, with just 13 percent seeing another drastic drop. Thirty  percent see prices moving higher.
