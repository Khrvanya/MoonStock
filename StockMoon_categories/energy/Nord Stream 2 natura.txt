Natural GasNord Stream 2 AG has handed in an application and an Environmental Impact Assessment report to the Danish Energy Agency for an alternative route for the 55 Bcm/year twin natural gas pipeline delivering Russian gas to Germany, the company said in a statement.The original application for the twin pipeline's route made back in April 2017 has not been withdrawn, and Nord Stream 2 continues to see this as "the preferred route" in Danish waters.
 
The alternative route has been applied for due to an amendment to the Continental Shelf Act on January 1 earlier this year, which allows the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs to recommend whether an application for infrastructure projects shall or shall not be handled by the Danish Energy Agency.
 
This year we have widened the Forum's coverage with dedicated sessions on LNG and Blockchain, to give you the fullest picture possible of the connections between regional and global markets.
 
Nord Stream 2 has been a highly controversial subject in terms of increasing Europe's reliance on Russian gas, which currently stands around the 40% mark, and potentially bypassing Ukraine as a transit country, harming the country's revenues in the process.
 
Indeed, the EU released a press statement on Thursday stating that it will be in discussions with the US to allow more US LNG exports to come to Europe to "diversify and render its energy supply more secure" by eyeing regulation changes on the US side.
