CO2North Macedonia is planning to end its use of coal for energy production by 2040 at the latest and sees a phase-out by 2025 as the cheapest option in two of three scenarios, environmental groups which helped draw up the strategy said on Monday.A final decision on which pathway the country will take will be made later this year, the groups said.
 
Of the three energy scenarios drawn up by the government of the European Union aspirant country, two aim for 2025 and the third delays the phase out until 2040, when the Bitola power plant is scheduled to shut down.
 
While Western Europe has been moving away from coal to meet climate goals, the Western Balkans remains home to seven of the ten most polluting coal-fired power plants in Europe.
 
The 27-member EU plans net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of the century, but faces resistance from its more coal-dependent members, led by Poland.
 
North Macedonia issued a tender last week seeking investors to build in a partnership with the state power utility ESM a 100 megawatt (MW) solar park at the site of a coal mine.
