LNGNorway's Equinor is ready to start talks with Tanzania on developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project based on a deepwater offshore discovery, the company said on Tuesday.Tanzanian President John Magufuli has asked his government to proceed with negotiations to set out the commercial and fiscal framework for the LNG project, Equinor, a majority state-owned energy company formerly known as Statoil, said.
 
Tanzania said in 2014 that a planned LNG export plant could cost up to $30 billion.
 
Royal Dutch Shell, which operates deepwater Blocks 1 and 4, adjacent to Equinor's Block 2, previously sought to develop the LNG project in partnership with Equinor and Exxon Mobil.
 
"Shell continues to work with the government of Tanzania to establish the most cost effective and competitive solution for the LNG project in Tanzania," a company spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters.
 
"We believe the government is best placed to lead the right way forward to deliver the project," she added.
