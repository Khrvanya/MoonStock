  The oil market should get a boost this summer from the "driving  season," the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  (OPEC) said on Wednesday, but added that demand from major  economies would be insufficient to offset the decline in  consumption elsewhere.   "Looking ahead, global products markets are once again expected  to receive support from gasoline demand ahead of the driving  season," the body said in its monthly report.   "However, unlike in the previous year, OECD gasoil demand may not  have sufficient strength to offset the continued slowdown in  non-OECD consumption," it added.   Crude remains in focus ahead of a flagship meeting at the weekend  between oil-producing countries.  and WTI crude futures declined on Wednesday,  following a more-than-4 percent jump during the previous  session.   Crude oil futures surged around 20 percent in March. This was the  best month since November 2015, OPEC said, and was largely based  on expectations of supply intervention by major crude oil  exporters.  OPEC added that hedge funds and other money managers had amassed  a "near-record" number of bullish bets on increasing oil prices.  That has helped push the main international benchmarks well above  $40 per barrel.  The organization forecast global oil demand growth would be  around 1.2 millions of barrels per day in 2016. This represented  a minor downward revision of 50,000 barrels per day from previous  expectations, mainly reflecting the slower economic momentum in  Latin America.  Leading oil producers, including Saudi Arabia, will meet  in Qatar at the weekend to discuss an output freeze to support  oil prices.   Saudi Arabia's oil minister ruled out an output cut on  Wednesday, according to media reports.   "Forget about this topic," he told the  Saudi-owned al-Hayat newspaper, according to  Reuters.
