  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)  slashed its oil supply forecast for Russia next year and said  continued geopolitical uncertainty was limiting its prospects for  economic growth.   OPEC, which represents oil-exporting nations, now forecasts  Russia will supply 10.51 million of barrels of oil per day (mb/d) on  average in 2015, down from the 10.53 million it predicts for  2014.   It also lowered Russia's GDP growth forecast to 0.3 percent in  2014 and 1.1 percent in 2015.  "Continued geopolitical uncertainty is increasingly limiting the  prospects for economic growth, amid currency depreciation, high  inflation and poor growth in retail sales. The expected second  round of EU economic sanctions would make faster GDP growth even  less likely," OPEC said in its monthly oil market report  published on Wednesday.   On Monday, the EU adopted fresh sanctions against Russia,  including restrictions on the country's large state-owned oil  companies operating in Europe. However, the penalties are yet to  be imposed, as officials wait to see if the cease-fire agreed  between Russia and Ukraine on Friday will hold.
