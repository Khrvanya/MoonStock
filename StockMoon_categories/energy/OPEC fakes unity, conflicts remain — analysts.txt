  OPEC ministers leave Vienna without a  production agreement, but with plenty of talk about unity, something  that could fade fast if oil prices crumble again.     Unlike the fractious meeting of OPEC members and nonmembers in  Doha, Qatar, in April, and at the cartel's gathering in late 2015, officials left the meeting Thursday stressing cooperation. Energy  ministers from the two biggest sources of conflict, Saudi Arabia  and Iran emerged from the meeting speaking of "collaboration" and "unity."  "Pressure to act (is) seemingly off at $50. Because we did not have  the public displays of discontent like in December, they can spin  the nonagreement on a production ceiling as a sign of OPEC  unity. The party line is that they all agreed the market is  moving in the right direction," wrote Helima Croft, global head of  commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, from Vienna.
