  Financial markets are on edge Wednesday as the 14-nation Organization  of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meeting in Vienna  wavers on a plan announced nearly two months ago to cut crude oil  output, though there are expectations "a deal of some sort" may be  pushed through to salvage the situation, said a Sydney-based  wealth manager.  "OPEC's message has to arrest the thought process that we are  going back into a bear market," Ayers Alliance Securities chief  investment officer, Jonathan Barratt, told CNBC's "Street  Signs".  Global crude prices trended higher on Wednesday amid conflicting  remarks by ministers attending the Vienna talks, that  called into question OPEC's ability to come to agreement about a  cut in production agreed to in September, with the details for  each country to be worked out by Nov. 30.OPEC members agreed at a September meeting in Algiers that they would work on an agreement to cut production to between  32.5 and 33 million barrels a day. The group produced more than  33.6 million barrels a day in October.  Oil prices have been in an extended slump since the summer of  2014 as demand growth slows and U.S. shale oil production  challenges traditional crude oil producers.
