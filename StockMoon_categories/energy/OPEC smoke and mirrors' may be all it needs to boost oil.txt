  Just the whiff of an OPEC meeting has driven oil prices higher,  squeezed shorts in the futures market — and made further inaction by the cartel more likely.  But that hasn't stopped market chatter that the Organization of  Petroleum Exporting Countries could revisit the idea of a production freeze  when it meets informally on the sidelines of an energy conference  in Algeria late next month.  Oil's recent dip back into the $30s per barrel may be enough to  get some OPEC members to curb their bickering and consider joint  action — if crude plummets again. But for now, analysts see  the cartel just talking, with the more needy members pushing for  relief through a freeze or other deal.
