WindGlobal offshore wind installations will hit 165GW by the end of the decade and are on track to reach 418GW by 2040, according to new research by UK analysts Rethink Energy.The global expansion of offshore wind will see the technology provide 5% of global electricity in two decades, as installed capacity balloons from the 25GW installed worldwide today.
 
The report predicts this growth will require some $1.3 trillion in investment and create 8 million jobs.
 
Rethink said the Asia Pacific region is on track to overtake Europe as the largest market for new installations within the 2020s and China is set to take over from the UK as the country with the most installed capacity by 2026.
