RenewableUK energy regulator Ofgem said is it minded to approve construction of a 600MW subsea interconnector from Shetland to mainland Scotland to support renewables expansion.The grid link to be built by SSE Networks (SSEN) would allow new wind farms on Shetland to export renewables to the rest of Great Britain and help ensure security of supply on the islands, it said.
 
Final approval for the link is dependent on SSE's up to 457MW Viking remote island wind farm securing a Contract for Difference (CfD) in this year's auction.
 
SSEN estimates the link would cost around PS709m and would be completed in 2024.
