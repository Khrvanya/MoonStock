Electricity MarketUK energy regulator Ofgem said today it has given the thumbs-up to the construction of a 220-MW high-voltage transmission line that will connect the Orkney Islands with the Scottish mainland.The interconnector, worth around GBP 260 million (USD 323.6m/EUR 293.1m), was proposed by Scottish and Southern Energy Networks (SSEN), part of UK utility SSE. The project is planned to be completed from 2023, enabling the interconnection of new wind parks and potentially tidal power plants.
 
The approval was granted following consultation and with conditions that require at least 135 MW of new wind projects on Orkney to be awarded Contracts for Difference (CfDs) or be "judged likely to be developed by December 2021."
