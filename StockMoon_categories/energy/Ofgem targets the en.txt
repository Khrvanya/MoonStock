EnergyNew measures have been announced by Ofgem aiming to offer clients the option to budge to better value deals at the end of the contract.  
The British company gives the chance for customers to turn to more affordable fees at the end of the fixed-term contract if the prices were of poor value. Ofgem announced about its decision to permit suppliers to extend the contract to customer that has not made a clear choice onto a further fixed-term tariff.

The new price should not contain any penalties for early closure and should be equal or cheaper in comparison with the variable tariff, otherwise the customer would pay the same price of customer's current tariff. It correlates to online account management, meter type and payment method. The regulation entity envisages a better differentiation among suppliers and better deals for customers.
 
Neil Barnes, Associate Partner, Consumers and Competition affirmed: "This decision does not require suppliers to change their default contracts for customers at the end of fixed-term tariffs. But we strongly encourage them to take advantage of the extra flexibility our decision provides and to make changes where it is in their customers' interest to do so."

The news appeared in the context of a recent publication of a draft bill by the British government to put a limit on energy prices.
