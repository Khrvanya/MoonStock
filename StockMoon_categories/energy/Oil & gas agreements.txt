Oil MarketThe volume of global oil and gas agreements reached a five-year low in 2017, according to a new report from business services firm EY, which declared that the total value of global transactions declined to $343 billion (PS247 billion) from $390 billion (PS281 billion) in 2016.Despite a 21% growth in single deals of over $1 billion (PS700 million) in 2017, an absence of deals of more than $50 billion (PS36 billion) meant that the total value dropped.

Nevertheless, the EY report still suggests the outlook for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) is positive for 2018, with upstream deal value likely to surge by approximately a third.
 
It mentions that this is likely to be encouraged by increasing activity among private equity groups and the implementation of more ground-breaking transaction structures.

Andy Brogan, EY Global Oil & Gas Transactions Leader, declared: "Risk sensitivity and a continued focus on internal performance improvement may have delayed the uptick in deal volume we expected in 2017. But the need to demonstrate appropriate returns is now pushing companies to reposition their portfolios and seek economies of scale, which in turn we anticipate will underpin more M&A activity in 2018."
