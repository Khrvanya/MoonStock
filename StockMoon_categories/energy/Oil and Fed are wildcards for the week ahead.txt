  Freefalling oil prices have created an environment of uncertainty  across financial markets but turbulence should not impede the Fed  from hiking interest rates Wednesday for the first time in nine  years.  The Fed is expected to lift its target fed funds rate off of  zero, ending a seven-year era of historic, crisis-level rate  policy. The central bank Wednesday will also provide economic and  interest rate forecasts that could help shape the view of  interest rates in 2016.  Both the pending Fed action and the plunge in oil, down 18  percent since Dec. 4, have come together as markets are  increasingly worried that widening spreads in the junk bond  market could be signaling a weakening economy and  a rougher time for stocks. Credit  markets became even more nervous Thursday over the liquidation of  distressed debt fund — Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund,  which halted redemptions.
