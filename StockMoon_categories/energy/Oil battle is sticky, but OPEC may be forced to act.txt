  Even with less drilling, U.S. oil production next year should  help keep world markets awash in crude and that may prompt OPEC  action by the middle of next year, analysts say.  Saudi Arabia reportedly sees $60 as the level where prices will  stabilize, after OPEC last week opted not to cut its production  quota. U.S. oil futures Friday closed at $65.84 per barrel, the lowest since 2009 and nearly 40 percent off its June high. Brent was just under $69 per barrel, and both had been trading  lower after reports Saudi Aramco cut its January prices to Asia and the  U.S.  "The problem for OPEC is if they don't blink. And let's say they  do shut down the rate of production growth in the U.S., and they  get a price back to where they like it to be, U.S. production  growth starts again," said Edward Morse, head of global  commodities research at Citigroup.Read MoreU.S. energy is growing and so is U.S. 'power'
