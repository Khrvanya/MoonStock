  Oil prices hit six-month highs on Monday on worries about global supply outages and  as long-time bear Goldman Sachs sounded more positive on the market, although a stockpile build at the U.S. storage hub  for crude futures limited gains.   Expectations of resumption in oil exports from a Libyan port, a ramp up in Nigerian crude production by Exxon Mobil  and an improved oil-for-loans deal reached by Venezuela with China furthered the tempered the bullish theme in oil.  Brent crude  futures settled up $1.14, or 2.4 percent, at  $48.97 per barrel. It rallied to $49.47 earlier, its highest  since early November, in a test towards $50.  U.S. crude's West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures  rose by $1.51, or 3.3  percent, to end at $47.72 after touching a six-month high at  $47.85. WTI saw a flurry of late buying, with more than 13,600  lots changing hands in the final minute, according to Reuters  data, in an attempt to test $48. Brent last traded up 2.6 percent at $49.08 while WTI traded up 3.7 percent at $47.90.   Crude futures have rallied for most of the past two weeks from a  combination of Nigerian, Venezuelan and other outages, declining  U.S. production and virtually frozen inflows of Canadian crude  after wildfires in Alberta's oil sands region.             The disruptions triggered a U-turn in the outlook for the oil  market from Goldman Sachs, which had long warned of global  storage hitting capacity and of another oil price crash to as low  as $20 per barrel.   "The oil market has gone from nearing storage saturation to being  in deficit much earlier than we expected," said Goldman, which  added that supply likely shifted into a deficit in May.   But some of Monday's bullish sentiment took a back seat when  market intelligence firm Genscape reported a stockpile build of  694,176 barrels at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery point for WTI  futures. The build surprised some market participants expecting a  stock decline in Cushing due to the shuttered Canadian  output.   Elsewhere, Exxon Mobil was expected to ramp up its production of  Nigeria's Qua Iboe crude while Libya's port of Hariga was slated  to resume blocked crude shipments.  Venezuela also reached a deal with China to improve conditions in  an oil-for-loans deal that gives the OPEC member breathing room  ahead of heavy debt payment.  While Goldman sounded more positive on the market than before, it  also cautioned that at around $50 a barrel, supply could flip  back into a surplus in the first half of 2017 if exploration and  production activity picked up.
