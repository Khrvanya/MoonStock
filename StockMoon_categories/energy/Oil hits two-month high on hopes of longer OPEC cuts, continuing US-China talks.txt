Oil prices rose more than 2% on Thursday following a Reuters report that OPEC and its allies are likely to extend output cuts until mid-2020, while fresh signs emerged that China had invited U.S. trade negotiators for a new round of talks.Brent crude futures gained $1.57, or 2.5%, to settle at $63.97 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures surged to a two-month high, gaining 2.8% to settle at $58.58, according to Dow Jones.To support oil prices, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are likely to extend output cuts to June when they meet next month, according to OPEC sources.OPEC meets on Dec. 5 at its headquarters in Vienna, followed by talks with a group of other oil producers, lead by Russia, known as OPEC+.
