  Nowadays, everything comes down to oil.  At least, that's the way that Boris Schlossberg of BK Asset Management sees it.  He says that right now, global markets, currencies and  U.S. stocks are all taking cues from the price of crude.  "All of the markets are focused on the price of oil as a sign as  whether risk is on or risk is off," Schlossberg said on Tuesday.  "If oil starts to rally, that's a signal to the market that  demand is coming back. It's as much a game of psychology as  economics at this point."Oil settled up 4 percent Tuesday, while the  gained 1.4 percent, led by energy stocks.  Schlossberg said stocks and oil will continue to move in tandem  until the price of crude stabilizes. And fortunately for investors,  he said oil could see a relief rally on signs that the  Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is cooperating  with non-OPEC countries to limit supply.Read More  This stock could rally 130 percent in one year: Trader  "I got the feeling that Saudi Arabia has decided that this is it,  that $30 has got to hold, they just can't have it any lower than  that," Schlossberg said in a "Trading Nation" interview. "If they  communicate to the market that they're going to contain supply,  that'll be enough for a short squeeze."  But Phillip Streible of RJO Futures still sees more pain ahead  for oil, thanks to record inventories and dwindling storage  space.  "I think oil prices still have a ways to go lower," Streible said  Tuesday on CNBC's "Trading Nation." "Once we get the credit  crisis coming out of the U.S. shale producers [and] the  production levels come down a bit, then I think we are closer to  that bottom."
