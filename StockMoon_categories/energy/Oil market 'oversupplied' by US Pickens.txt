 Although T. Boone  Pickens says he is "no fan" of  the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting  Countries, the current situation in oil is out of  its control, he wrote during a question-and-answer session on  Twitter. Instead, the billionaire oil tycoon placed the blame on the U.S., saying that  the oil market is "oversupplied" by the country. In recent  months, oil prices have nosedived, pressured by a glut in  supply.  So what signs should investors look for as they gauge a potential  bottom in oil?  The number of oil drilling rigs operating, among other factors,  could prove an indicator of when oil prices will bottom, Pickens  wrote. Pickens also shared his thoughts on the merger  and acquisition market, U.S. economy, hydraulic fracturing and sports.
