  Oil prices surged dramatically in the last two weeks thanks to  OPEC freeze talk, but there's little expectation the cartel will  act, especially now that crude is trading 24 percent higher just  on hot air.  Oil, up nearly 9 percent this week alone, has raced higher since  West Texas  Intermediate crude futures dipped below $40 per barrel in early August. In just 16 days, oil  futures are approaching $50 - settling at $48.52 per barrel Friday.  While analysts say oil could back off its highs, there's a more  bullish tone to the market. Investors are building new long  positions, offsetting a major short position, which has been  whittled away from record levels by short covering.
