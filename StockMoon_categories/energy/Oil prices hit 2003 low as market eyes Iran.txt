  Oil prices slumped to a 2003 low below $28 per barrel on Monday  as the market anticipated a rise in Iranian exports after the  lifting of sanctions against Tehran over the weekend.  Responding to Tehran's compliance with a nuclear deal, the United  States and major powers revoked international sanctions that had  cut Iran's oil exports by about 2 million barrels per day (bpd)  since their pre-sanctions 2011 peak to little more than 1 million  bpd.  Iran, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting  Countries (OPEC), issued an order on Monday to increase  production by 500,000 bpd, the country's deputy oil minister  said.  Worries about Iran's return to an already oversupplied oil market  drove down Brent  crude to $27.67 a barrel early on Monday, its lowest  since 2003. The benchmark was down 29 cents at $28.64 by 1850  GMT. U.S. crude was down 48 cents at  $28.94 a barrel, not far from a 2003 low of $28.36 hit earlier in  the session. Trading volumes were thin with U.S. markets closed  for the Martin Luther King Day holiday.  "You can't say this was unexpected but the Iran news is an  additional factor that's working against oil prices," said TD  Securities analyst Bart Melek, who also pointed to global  oversupply and concerns about demand from China.  He said oil could fall further if Chinese economic data released  overnight, including GDP and retail sales data, points to more  weakness in the economy.  "If we get nasty economic numbers from China there's potential  for another swoosh lower," Melek said.  Analysts expect Iran will realistically be able to export an  extra 500,000 bpd in the short term from storage, but there are  doubts whether the state of Iran's oil infrastructure will allow  further boosts anytime soon.  SEB Markets assumes Iranian oil output will rise by 400,000 bpd  to 3.2 million bpd in 2016, while Tehran has said it will add 1  million bpd to its existing output by the year-end.  Iran has at least a dozen Very Large Crude Carrier super-tankers  filled and in place to sell into the market.  In a sign of the pain low prices are inflicting on oil producers,  OPEC forecast that supply outside the organisation would decline  by 660,000 bpd in 2016, led by the United States. Last month OPEC  predicted a drop of 380,000 bpd.
