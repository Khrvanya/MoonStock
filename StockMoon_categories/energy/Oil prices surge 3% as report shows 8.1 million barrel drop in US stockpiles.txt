Oil prices spiked higher after the close of Tuesday's session after an industry report suggested U.S. crude inventories fell more than expected.The American Petroleum Institute reported U.S. crude stockpiles declined by 8.1 million barrels for the week ended July 7. Gasoline stocks also fell by about 800,000 barrels, API reported.Analysts polled by Reuters forecast that U.S. crude inventories fell 3.2 million barrels while gasoline and distillate stocks each rose by 1.5 million barrels.U.S. light crude rose more than 3 percent to $45.76 by 4:51 p.m. ET (2051 GMT) . They ended Tuesday's session 1.4 percent higher at $45.04.

Barclays also cut its 2017 and 2018 Brent forecasts to $52 a barrel for both years from $55 and $57 respectively.Crude prices remain about 17 percent below 2017 opening levels despite a deal led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut production from January.OPEC agreed with Russia and some other major exporters to cut output about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018. But production elsewhere has risen as OPEC has held back.U.S. oil production has jumped more than 10 percent over the last year to 9.34 million bpd. Nigeria and Libya, OPEC members exempt from production limits, have also increased output.OPEC oil output rose in June by more than 300,000 barrels per day, (bpd) according to figures the exporter group uses to monitor its supply.Including Nigeria and Libya, output by all 13 OPEC members in June rose to about 32.47 million bpd, according to the average assessments of secondary sources OPEC uses to monitor its output.Production from the 11 OPEC members with output targets under the agreement has averaged 29.84 million bpd in June, according to the secondary sources. That means compliance in June is 97 percent, according to an OPEC calculation. That is lower than in May, as OPEC's published figures for that month point to compliance above 100 percent.Without a significant fall in oil inventories or a decline in U.S. drilling and production, Goldman Sachs said U.S. crude could drop below $40 per barrel.— CNBC's Tom DiChristopher contributed to this report.
