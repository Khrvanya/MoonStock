  Oil prices fell to a five-year low on Monday, after Morgan  Stanley cut its 2015 forecast for Brent crude, citing oversupply.   The bank said Brent crude prices could average as little as $53 per  barrel in 2015, although its base case scenario was for $70. This  was down from an earlier estimate of $98.   "Without OPEC intervention, markets risk becoming unbalanced,  with peak oversupply likely in the second quarter of 2015. Prices  are set up to fall in the first half of 2015," said analysts Adam  Longson and Elizabeth Volynsky in a report out late on  Friday.   The price of oil has declined by around 40 percent since June,  with Brent futures falling bellow $67 on Monday—their lowest  level since October 2009. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) fueled the decline further last month, when it  resisted calls to reduce production in order to boost  prices.   Now, Morgan Stanley has cut its Brent forecast for all of 2015,  2016, 2017 and 2018. In the worst case scenario, the bank said  oil could fall as low as $43 in the second quarter of next year,  recovering to only $48 in the third quarter.   "With OPEC on the sidelines, oil prices face their greatest  threat since 2009," said Longson and Volynsky. "Without  intervention, physical markets and prices will face serious  pressure, with the second quarter of 2015 likely marking the peak  period of dislocation."

Longer-term, the decline in prices could prove to be  self-limiting however.   "Lower prices will curtail investment, increase the risk of OPEC  intervention or an outage, or even shut in wells. Based on our  forecasts, activity should slow sharply, and if intervention is  large and swift, price recovery in 2H15 (second half of 2015)  could be swift as well," the analysts said.   Saudi Arabia—the top producer in OPEC—sees oil prices  stabilizing at $60, Dow Jones reported last  week.
