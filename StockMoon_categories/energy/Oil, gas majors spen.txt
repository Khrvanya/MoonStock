EnergyTop oil and gas companies invested only around 1.3% of their total capital expenditure this year on clean energy.That's according to new research, which adds companies in Europe are spending the most amount on low carbon energy compared to their rivals in the US and Asia.
 
Across the 24 oil and gas majors analysed by environmental non-profit company CDP, European firms accounted for 70% of current renewable capacity and nearly all projects under development - Equinor, Total, Shell and Eni have been ranked at the top spots for leading the low carbon transition.
 
Shell plans to spend between $1 billion (PS0.77bn) and $2 billion (PS1.6bn) per year on clean energy technologies out of its total budget of $25 billion (PS19bn) to $30 billion (PS23bn).
 
Norway's Equinor has pledged 15% to 20% of its budget on renewable energy by 2020 while Total has spent around 4.3% of its budget on green energy since 2010.
 
However, it suggests US-based companies have not embraced renewables in the same way "with less domestic pressure to diversify".
