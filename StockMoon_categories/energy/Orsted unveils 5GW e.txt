RenewableOrsted is planning to establish the island of Bornholm as Denmark's first offshore wind cluster interconnecting with two to three neighbouring countries to deliver up to 5GW of power.The Danish company said the hub could potentially connect with Poland, Sweden and possibly Germany.
 
Orsted said that the first step would be for Denmark to put a 1GW offshore wind farm at Ronne Banke out for tender to be built at the same time as new interconnectors between the country and Poland.
 
Orsted said areas south-west of Bornholm are reserved for government tenders of offshore wind, and, in an April study, the Danish Energy Agency estimated the potential of these areas to above 3GW.
 
After the interconnection between Denmark and Poland, the project may be expanded with connections to other countries, such as Sweden and Germany, the company said.
 
This could deliver a "decisive and necessary contribution to the Danish government's ambition of lowering Denmark's carbon emissions by 70% by 2030", Orsted said.
