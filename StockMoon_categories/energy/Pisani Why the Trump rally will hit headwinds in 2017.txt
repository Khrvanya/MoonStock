  Stock rally? Oil rally? Everyone's bullish now, but  that will get tougher in 2017. But maybe investors who  abandoned the market a decade ago will come back.   Here are three predictions for 2017.First, the stock rally will continue ... but will hit major  headwinds. The  will hit a series of historic  highs again within the first 100 days of Donald Trump taking  office, but that will be it. The problem: Market  participants are anticipating MUCH higher revenues and earnings  due to tax cuts and fiscal stimulus, but actual company guidance  will not match those high expectations. A stronger dollar,  higher rates, inflation and possibly trade policy will emerge as  potential headwinds.Second, the oil rally will be a bust. As oil heads toward  $60 a barrel, American producers will ramp up production, keeping prices  down. The much-discussed agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC  members to cut oil production will collapse among charges of  widespread cheating. Finally, 2017 will be the year stock ownership expands. The  American public has seen declining levels of stock ownership for  years. A Gallup poll earlier this year found that only 52 percent of households own stocks, tied for the lowest level on record. An earlier study found that 82 percent of all stock is owned by  the top 10 percent of households. But rising GDP and greater  optimism on the economy will finally reverse those trends in  2017, and households that abandoned the market after the  financial crisis in 2008 will return and start buying stocks  again.Wouldn't it be great if that last prediction really happens? Wouldn't it be nice if more households owned stock? Stock ownership has becoming concentrated in a narrower and  narrower group ever since the financial crisis.Wouldn't it be great if that trend reversed in 2017?
