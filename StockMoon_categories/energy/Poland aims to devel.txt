RenewablePoland has been continuously enhancing its share of green energies with the aim to decarbonize its economy, challenging stereotypes that describe it as the coal-dependent on Europe. Nevertheless, the development of renewable technologies looks to have reduced since the 2015 peak.Within the  national action plan under EU's renewable energy directive, around 15% of total energy use in Poland should derive from renewables by 2020. The year 2015 was one of renewable energy in Poland, as it boosted its wind power capacity by 27% and more than doubled its solar capacity.

Marta Gajecka, vice-president of the Polish Electricity Association (PKEE) declared: "There are a lot of stereotypes about Poland relying only on coal. There are a lot of stereotypes about Poland relying only on coal." 

Poland wishes to construct two new offshore wind plants. The energy cost from offshore wind turbines, which halved from over 100 euros/MWh reached in 2016,  became attractive for investors and countries willing to attain their energy objectives.
 
Pierre Tardieu of WindEurope accentuated that whereas in 2015 Poland installed 1.5 gigawatts of wind-power capacity, making it one of the rapidly developing markets in Europe, in 2016 this amounted only to 600 megawatts. 

Following the new retroactive legislation instituted in 2015, solar electricity generation dropped by 20% in Bulgaria.

Eurelectric, which represent power suppliers in Europe regardless the energy source, stated that these regulatory modifications raise the costs and emphasizes the necessity for financial backing from the bloc in order to fossil-reliant nations to invest in new, renewable energy capacity.
