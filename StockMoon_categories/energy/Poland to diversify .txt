EnergyPoland's energy ministry released on Friday a draft energy policy to 2040, under which the share of coal power is expected to decrease to 60% in 2030 from over 78% in 2017 with the help of new sources like offshore wind and nuclear energy.The policy was submitted for consultation by January 15, 2019. On Friday it attracted criticism by Greenpeace Polska and WindEurope, mainly due to the fact that onshore wind is totally neglected, and also because it ignores the threats and challenges posed by climate change.
 
The Polish government expects to build 6 GW to 9 GW of nuclear power capacity by 2043 and to have the country's first offshore wind farm up and running after 2025. A 21% share of renewable energy sources in final gross energy consumption is targeted for 2030. This includes a modest increase of 1-1.3 percentage points in the share of green energy in heating and cooling, growth in renewables' power share to 27% mainly due to offshore wind, and a 14% renewables share in transport in 2030. Options to balance renewables will be studied and there is also a plan to build energy storage capacity.
 
Poland will also work to expand its transmission and distribution network and cross-border connections, and develop smart grids.
