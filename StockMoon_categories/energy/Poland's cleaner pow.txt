Electricity MarketPoland is on track to import a record amount of electricity this year as power traders buy cheaper and cleaner electricity from neighboring countries, reducing demand for the mostly coal-fired energy produced by state-run utilities.Poland's power imports soared by 24.6% to 8.1 TWh in the first nine months of the year compared with the same period in 2018, data from power grid operator PSE shows.
 
Although still a small part of the country's total energy requirements, the rise is being driven by a surge in wholesale electricity prices in Poland, where 80% of power generated comes from burning coal, as carbon emission costs and coal prices increase.
