Electricity MarketPoland's energy minister, Krzysztof Tchorzewski, said on Wednesday that the country would have to maintain controls on electricity prices to secure economic competitiveness.The ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) imposed a cap on household power tariffs this year in an effort to prevent a spike triggered by gains in carbon emissions costs and coal prices.
 
A PiS plan to freeze 2019 power prices for companies and the public sector failed because the European Commission raised concerns, but the government instead proposed compensation for the biggest energy consumers hurt by increased tariffs.
 
Next year's power prices may become a hot-button issue ahead of a general election in October, just as they were before local elections in 2018, when PiS promised to freeze them.
