  Russia's military buildup and bombing campaign in Syria this  week rekindled the security premium in oil prices.   Crude futures are the place for many traders to hedge their  portfolios against geopolitical risk, especially when it concerns  the Middle East.   While the supply and demand fundamentals of oil remain  overwhelmingly bearish or negative for prices, Russia's  involvement caused prices to surge higher the past two  weeks.   Last week, the mere news of the Russian military buildup caused  the oil market to rally and hold onto some of those gains even in  the face of bearish inventory data from the Department of Energy  in its weekly report.   Prices rallied again earlier this week, on news of the initial  bombing sorties carried out by the Russian air force.
