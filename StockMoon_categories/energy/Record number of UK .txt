The data comes as Britain's energy companies are under pressure to cut bills and as regulator Ofgem prepares to release a price limit on the most broadly used tariffs.

It also continues last year's evolution when a record of 5.5 million customers switched in 2017, or a hike from 4.8 million in 2016, according to Energy UK.

At present, there are more than 60 energy suppliers in Britain.

Britain's major energy suppliers, operating about 80 percent of the market are Centrica's British Gas, SSE, E.ON, EDF Energy, Innogy's Npower and Iberdrola's Scottish Power.
