RenewableGermany met with renewables a record 44% of its electricity needs in the first half of 2019, mainly thanks to strong winds in the period, new data shows.The share represents an jump from 39% recorded in the same period of 2018.
 
The preliminary statistics by the Centre for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research Baden-Wurttemberg (ZSW) and the Federal Association of the Energy and Water Industry (BDEW) show that onshore wind was the main contributor for the increase. Accounting for 19% of the nation's total power consumption, wind farms on land produced 55.8 billion kWh, which is up from 47.3 billion kWh a year back. Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems were responsible for 8% with 24 billion kWh produced, rising from 23 billion kWh. Offshore wind generation jumped to 12 billion kWh from 9.2 billion kWh in the year-ago period, meeting 4% of demand.
 
Other renewables, including biomass and hydropower plants, produced 36.7 billion kWh, down from 37.2 billion kWh in the first half of 2018. Biomass accounted for 8%, while hydropower covered 4% of demand.
