RenewableThe share of renewables in UK power generation reached 35.5% in the second quarter of 2019, up from 32% in the same three months of 2018Capacity additions in offshore wind and plant biomass, and also a decrease in overall generation, led to this record second-quarter result, says the latest energy report by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). The combined output of green power plants stood at 27.1 TWh, up 10% year-on-year.
 
The top contributor in the quarter was bioenergy with a share of 34% in renewable power generation. Offshore wind and onshore wind each reached 22%, while the share of solar power was 18%. The table contains more details.
 
In mid-2019, the UK had 45.9 GW of renewable power generation capacity or 7.9% more than a year earlier. In offshore wind, the total capacity was up by 18% to 9.2 GW, mainly thanks to Hornsea and Beatrice. Onshore wind grew by almost a gigawatt with 34 new parks opening in the quarter under review.
 
The total capacity of plant biomass plants reached 6 GW, rising by 8.5%, following the conversion to biomass at Lynemouth.
 
The UK's PV capacity inched up by 2.8% to 13.3 GW.
