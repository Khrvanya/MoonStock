Oil MarketRepsol Sinopec Resources UK has started working on projects across a number of its assets in the UK North Sea that should realize in the region of an additional 10 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), beginning later this year.In an update on Friday, Repsol Sinopec said that activity is already under way to reinstate production from the Galley field.
 
A subsea tieback to the Tartan platform, Galley production was halted in August 2012 following a subsea pipeline failure. Repsol Sinopec has said that production is scheduled to re-start in July this year and to continue through at least to cessation of production on Tartan, contributing 1.1m boe at an initial rate of around 1,500 boepd.
 
Galley production also reduces Tartan's requirement to import fuel gas, thereby contributing to a further reduction in Tartan operating costs and supporting extended operating life, the company explained.
 
Also in the Flotta catchment area, reactivation of the drilling package on Claymore is nearing completion and will be followed by a similar reinstatement on Piper Bravo.
