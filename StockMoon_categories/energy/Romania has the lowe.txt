EnergyRomania has the lowest energy consumption per capita in the European Union and needs to increase its domestic consumption by expanding distribution networks and investing in new natural gas-based power plants."The average household consumption of a domestic consumer in Romania is lower than the EU average, as is the total gross energy consumption per capita, where Romania had the lowest level in the EU in 2015 - 1.8 toe (Eurostat 2017) against the EU average of 3.2 toe and the maximum in Luxembourg of 7.3 toe," the report says.
 
"The PRIMES projection for 2030 indicates that nearly 3.2 million households will use natural gas (45% of total) compared to 2.5 million in 2015 (33% of total), which shows both a likely expansion of the gas distribution networks and a continuation of the disconnection tendency of the users of centralized district heating systems," the report says.
 
"Romania has a net installed capacity of about 3,650 MW of natural gas production, of which 1,750 MW are thermal and electrical cogeneration capacities. 450 MW are in reserve and 1,150 MW are approaching the end of their technical ifetime, having to be withdrawn from use between 2017-2023," the experts say.
 
According to the experts, much of Romania's offshore gas will be exported without stimulating domestic gas consumption.
