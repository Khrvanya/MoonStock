The project consists of 2 lines across the Black Sea, the 1st of which will serve Turkey with a capacity of 15.75 bcm, while the 2nd line is planned to serve Europe. Each pipeline is 930 km in length, laid at depths reaching 2,200 m. After the 1st line is filled with natural gas, preparations will begin on the 2nd line.
 
The project is the biggest-diameter offshore gas pipeline in the world laid at such depths. The world's biggest construction vessel, the Pioneering Spirit, carried out the deep-sea pipe laying.
