Oil MarketRussia's oil output will be cut by another 1 million barrels per day over the next week after its oil exports were restricted due to contamination issues.The contaminated crude oil was shipped through Transneft's Druzhba pipeline, causing the pipeline operator to call on Russian oil producers to request reduced volumes - a 10% reduction, Oil Price reported.
 
The contamination issue - which Transneft says was deliberate - has been quite a headache for Russia, but European refineries are taking most of the brunt, and have caused Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary to release 8 million barrels of oil reserves to keep their refineries refining.
 
Russia's oil production had already fallen in April to 11.23 million barrels per day, although the levels were still above its production quota that it agreed to with OPEC of 11.191 million bpd.
