  Russian officials have decided they should talk to Saudi Arabia  and other OPEC countries about output cuts to bolster oil prices,  the head of Russia's pipeline monopoly said on Wednesday, remarks  that helped spur a sharp rise in world prices.   Oil futures surged more than 5 percent after the comments by  Nikolai Tokarev, head of oil pipeline monopoly Transneft, which  gave the strongest hint yet of possible cooperation between the  top non-OPEC oil producer and the cartel to try to reverse a  record glut.   Brent crude rose by over $2 to $32.95 a barrel, after a session  low of $30.83. It was also boosted by U.S. demand following a  blizzard.   But there was still a long journey from starting discussions to  actual cuts by Russian oil producers, with many of them saying  reducing output was technically very difficult and could lead to  Russia losing market share to its competitors.   Tokarev said oil executives and government officials meeting in  Moscow on Tuesday had reached the conclusion that talks with OPEC  were needed to shore up the oil price.   "At the meeting there was discussion in particular about the oil  price and what steps we should take collectively to change the  situation for the better, including negotiations within the  framework of OPEC as a whole, and bilaterally," Russian news  agencies quoted Tokarev as saying.   "The main initiative is being shown by, of course, our Saudi  partners. They are the main negotiators. That means that they are  the ones we need to discuss this with first of all."   He said output cuts would be on the agenda for talks with OPEC  countries: "Yes, that is one of the levers or mechanisms that  would allow us to in some way balance the oil price."   An energy ministry representative confirmed to Reuters that  possible coordination with OPEC had been discussed at the  meeting, which the ministry hosted.   "The meeting participants discussed the possibility of  coordination of actions with OPEC members amid unfavorable  market conditions on the global oil market," the Energy Ministry  official said.  Low prices pressure  Oil prices have fallen from around $115 in the middle of 2014,  causing problems for Russia's cash-strapped budget and pushing  the Russian economy into recession. Some members of the  Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries want  coordinated output cuts to push up the price, and they have been  pressing Russia to play its part.   If discussions with OPEC begin in earnest, that would be a major  reversal in Russia's stance. Russian production reached a new  post-Soviet high in December of 10.80 million barrels per day.  That puts it on par with Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer,  which also pumps more than 10 million bpd.   OPEC, which collectively accounts for a third of global output,  failed to agree any cuts at a meeting last month, with the Saudis  apparently determined to maintain their market share and drive  out high-cost producers in the United States.   Iran, previously kept from international markets by sanctions  lifted this month, is also planning to increase its production  rapidly into a world that produces 1.5 million barrels per day  more than it consumes and has been running out of capacity to  store it cheaply.        So far, within OPEC, only Algeria and Venezuela have clearly  expressed support for a production cut.   However, Iraq, OPEC's second biggest producer after Saudi Arabia,  also showed signs on Wednesday of softening its stance. Finance  Minister Hoshiyar Zebari told Reuters in an interview that  Baghdad was ready to take part in an extraordinary OPEC meeting  and even reduce its oil output if all OPEC members and non-OPEC  producers agree."It's interesting to see how the positions from both Russia and  Iraq seem to be softening slightly - but I don't think it means a  thing because the Saudis continue to say that they will only take  action with collaboration from Russia, Iraq and Iran," said  Societe Generale oil analyst Michael Wittner in New York.      Industry reluctant  Considerable obstacles remain to cutting Russian production.  Speaking to Reuters before the meeting at the energy ministry  took place, two senior officials said no groundwork had been laid  for cooperating with OPEC on output.   "There are not any measures on possibly cutting production being  discussed now," said one of the officials, who spoke on condition  of anonymity.   Another official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of  the sensitivity of the matter, echoed that. "It is impossible to  coordinate the process and stop production in Russia," the second  source said.   A manager at a top-four Russian energy firm said coordinated cuts  would not be welcomed by an industry that was fighting the  possibility of declining production because of a rising tax  burden and ageing fields.   "Russia has too much risk of seeing a natural decline anyway,  without any agreed special steps," the manager said, playing down  the possibility of agreed action. Another oil company source  said: "We've heard nothing of any specific actions."   Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital  Markets sounded a skeptical note.   "Ultimately, if we want to see cuts, we have to see this driven  by (President Vladimir) Putin. Or even (Rosneft boss) Igor  Sechin, who is close to the inner circle. But, he's been publicly  emphatic that there will be no cuts."   "Last year, the Saudis kept saying publicly and privately that  they had asked the Russians to cut production in the run up to  the November meeting. They decided they had no way to balance  this on their own because Russia would just take their market  share," Croft said.   Mikhail Leontyev, spokesman for Rosneft, Russia's biggest  producer, said "he saw no grounds" to comment on the Energy  Ministry's statement. Gazprom Neft, Russia's fastest growing oil  company by volume, declined to comment.    A spokesman for Lukoil, Russia's No.2 oil producer whose  vice-president said earlier this week that Moscow should start  talking to OPEC, declined to comment.  A spokeswoman for Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich, in  charge of the energy sector, also declined to comment.    Russia holds regular discussions with various countries,  including oil-producing ones, on the situation on oil markets but  there are no plans as of now for coordinated actions, the  Kremlin's spokesman said on Wednesday.
