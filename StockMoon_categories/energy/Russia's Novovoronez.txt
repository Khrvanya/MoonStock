NuclearUnit two of the Russian Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant II, equipped with the VVER-1200 reactor, was brought to Minimum Control Power (MCP), Russia's state atomic energy corporation, Rosatom, confirmed in a statement on Monday.A MCP level is reached when the neutron flux is recorded in a reactor working at a level sufficient to sustain a fission chain reaction.
 
"Reaching MCP is considered as the final stage of the physical start-up procedure," Rosatom explained.
 
Every stage has occurred on schedule and in compliance with all safety regulations. In due course, specialists will conduct a set of physical experiments on the neutronic characteristics of the reactor's first fuel charge, as well as confirm the operational reliability of the reactor's entire monitoring and safety systems.
