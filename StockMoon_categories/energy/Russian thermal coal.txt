CoalRussian thermal coal production is set to grow over 100 million mt by 2035, as the country looks to invest in new coal infrastructure and focus increasingly on the growing Asia-Pacific region, President Vladimir Putin said in a meeting with heads of coal mining regions last week.Putin said Russia's main competitors in the seaborne market were Australia and Indonesia, which both benefitted from better logistical conditions as the coal mines are generally located closer to the export terminal than in Russia.
 
Alexander Valentinovich, minister of energy, said that Russia's current coal production exceeded 440 million mt, and was nearly 10% higher than the initial plan for Russian coal through to 2030.
 
Russia's coal development program through to 2035 had been revised upward, from current 440 million mt/year to 550 million mt/year, and as high as 670 million mt/year, the minister said.
