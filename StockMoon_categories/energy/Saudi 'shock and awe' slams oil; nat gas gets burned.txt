  OPEC talked down the oil market, sending crude sharply lower,  while warm weather and growing supply battered natural gas  prices. West Texas Intermediate futures for February fell more than  3 percent, or $1.87, to $55.26 per barrel, as traders reacted to  comments from Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi. Natural  gas fell more than 9 percent to $3.144 a million British thermal  units in the biggest one-day drop since February.Read More Naimi and other officials attending an energy conference in  Abu Dhabi reaffirmed OPEC's decision to hold output at current  levels. He said the steep drop in oil prices was due to the  lack of coordination among other non-OPEC producers as well as  speculators and misleading information. Naimi said it was not in the interest of OPEC to cut  production, no matter what the price is. "Whether it goes down to  $20, $40, $50, $60, it is irrelevant," he was quoted as  saying.
