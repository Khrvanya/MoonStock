  Saudi Arabia's plan to diversify its economy away from oil  grabbed the headlines this week, but other crude exporters have  similar plans.   Saudi Arabia's "Vision 2030," which includes plans to create the  world's biggest sovereign wealth fund, privatize state-owned  companies and attract more tourists, joins a host of similarly  named programs from other Gulf states.   Oman hatched its "Vision 2020" in 1996, while the United Arab  Emirates (UAE) has "Vision 2021" and there is "Vision 2030" in  Bahrain and the "Qatar National Vision 2030" — all aimed at  diversifying economies away from oil.   This is an urgent move as  and WTI crude oil prices remain far  below the above-$100 per barrel levels reached before the  collapse in oil prices began in June 2014.   "We think the Gulf is acting in a much more vigorous and  far-reaching way than was the case the last time oil prices  collapsed in the 1980s," Charles Robertson and Vikram Lopez of  boutique investment bank, Renaissance Capital, said in a report  on Thursday.   "Reform then was modest and late, and by the 1990s their  economies remained too dependent on the state, over-subsidized  and with excessively rigid labor markets," the strategists added.          The UAE and Bahrain are already making the subsidy cuts promised  by Saudi Arabia and have previous embarked on privatization  drives that Robertson and Lopez said delivered good results in  the 1990s.   Slightly less of UAE's gross domestic product is based on oil and  gas output — 40 percent — than in Saudi  Arabia, where half of the economy is directly based on energy.  That is according to OPEC, to which both countries  belong.   Some oil-producing countries, including Venezuela, Ecuador, Nigeria and Angola,  defaulted on their sovereign debt in the 1980s when crude prices  entered a six-year slump.   However, there is hope that at least some countries will cope  better this time.  "We are encouraged by reforms that should help oil exporters  manage in a $45 oil price world, with potential upside surprise  if oil does not continue to follow the 1980s template," Robertson  and Lopez said.   Oxford Economics said on Tuesday that sovereign distress was less  than in the 1980s, due to far lower interest rates and greater  ease of refinancing debt.   "A long grind lies ahead, but history suggests those adhering to  fiscal and real exchange rate adjustment can restore growth," the  economic-forecasting firm said in a report.  Several oil-producing countries have opted to float their  currencies recently, including Russia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.  This has led currencies to devalue, making their exports more  competitive and serving as an economic "shock absorber."Oxford Economics saw sovereign default as "imminent" in Venezuela, however.   "An IMF program (in Venezuela) would probably be the best  solution to the current crisis, but the government has always had  a strong anti-IMF anti-imperialist rhetoric," it noted.
