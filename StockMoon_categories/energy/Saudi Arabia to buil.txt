SolarCrown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman and Masayoshi Son, chairman and CEO of SoftBank Group Corp, signed a solar power project accord. Saudi Arabia and SoftBank inked the agreement for a solar power project estimated at $200 billion, affirming that it the biggest solar site worldwide in terms of capacity.

Saudi Arabia targets to produce 200 gigawatts of power from the project while lessening reliance on oil. The project comprises solar panels, battery storage and a panel manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia. This capacity is double that of China's project which is 100 gigawatts of installed solar energy capacity.

More than that, it exceeds the capacity of almost 6,000 functional solar projects at present, under construction or in development in the U.S., representing approximately 70 gigawatts of capacity, according to the major solar projects list database of the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The achievement of the entire project is scheduled by 2030, while installation of solar panels is planned to begin this year, and power generation by the middle of next year. For the initial project phase, SoftBank's Vision Fund will allocate $1 billion and the remaining $4 billion will come from other funding opportunities.

On Tuesday, during Prince Salman's U.S. visit, Saudi and U.S. firms inked 36 memorandums of understanding which are valued at $16 billion.
