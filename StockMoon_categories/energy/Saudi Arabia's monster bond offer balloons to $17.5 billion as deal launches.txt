 Saudi  Arabia launched a $17.5 billion sovereign offering Wednesday  in its first foray into the international bond market,  drawing strong demand for the dollar-denominated offer.  The debt offering  is a key part of the kingdom's  economic reform plan as it would give Saudi Arabia a sovereign  benchmark that would help open its capital markets for future  offerings, such as corporate issues. It also is a necessary boost to cash flow to help the country withstand a long downturn in oil prices.  The deal was initially expected to be $10 billion-$15 billion, but demand was strong with a total order book of $67 billion.   According to Informa Global Markets, the offering is the largest Middle Eastern sovereign deal and is now the  largest emerging market deal, surpassing Argentina's $16.5  billion debt offering earlier this year. Moody's rates the  Saudi bonds as A1 with a stable outlook and Fitch rates them AA-  with a negative outlook. Argentina was a high-yield issue.  Final pricing terms were more favorable than initially  anticipated, tighter by more than 20 basis points per issue. The $5.5 billion in five-year notes are expected to yield 135  basis points over the U.S. five-year Treasury; the $5.5  billion 10-year notes are expected at 165 bps over the U.S.  10-year and the $6.5 billion 30-year is expected to yield 210 over the U.S.  long bond. The final deal pricing and allocations are expected at  about 3 p.m. EDT.   Saudi officials ended a weeklong roadshow for  the multi-tranche dollar offering with an investor meeting in New York on Tuesday.
