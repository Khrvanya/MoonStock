SolarSenegal's Electricity Sector Regulation Commission (CRSE) has chosen ENGIE and investment partner Meridiam as favourite bidders for two solar projects with a total capacity of 60 MW. 
The authorities of Senegal together with the International Finance Corporation are leading the Scaling Solar initiative which comprises the two solar projects.  The locations chosen for solar panel installations are Kahone (Kaolack region), and Touba-Kael (Diourbel region).

ENGIE and Meridiam will be in possession of 40% shareholding whilst the Senegalese sovereign fund (FONSIS) will have a 20% equity stake. ENGIE will be responsible for construction and operation of the plants.

CEO of ENGIE Africa, Yoven Moorooven claimed that their consortium offered the most competitive proposal, with experience in renewable energy projects carried out in Africa, especially in Senegal. The fact that ENGIE, a long-term investor, won the bid, demonstrates a combined effort of the CRSE and the IFC in creation of a healthy investment framework. It was also stated that the consortium's closest attention would be paid to construction process and finalization of sustainable solar plants.

COO of Meridiam Africa, Mathieu PELLER declared that their fund would keep on selecting projects with considerable impact on durable economic development. Due to low cost of solar equipment it was possible to initiate this project that chiefly aims to make Senegal increase its clean energy generation capacity. Rising electricity generation is a crucial objective for the Senegal government.
