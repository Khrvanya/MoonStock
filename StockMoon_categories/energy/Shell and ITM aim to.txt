HydroShell and ITM Power plan to build the world's biggest hydrogen electrolysis plant in Germany.The facility with a peak capacity of 10MW will be located in Rhineland. The site will produce hydrogen utilized for the processing and refining of products, as well as assessing hydrogen technology and exploring its applications.

A conglomerate of companies which comprises SINTEF, Thinkstep and Element Energy has obtained a funding of EUR10 million (PS8.8 million) from the European Fuel Cell Hydrogen Joint Undertaking, covering around half of the project's overall costs. 

The associated firms are expecting to launch detailed technical planning and undergo approval procedure for operation. The plant is scheduled to become functional by 2020.

Lori Ryerkerk, Executive Vice President of Shell Manufacturing, declared: "This new unit at Rhineland enables hydrogen to be made from electricity rather than natural gas. If powered by renewable electricity, the green hydrogen will help reduce the carbon intensity of the site - a key goal for us."
