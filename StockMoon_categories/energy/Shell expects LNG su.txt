LNGShell revealed in its recent 2018 LNG Outlook report on Monday that a supply shortage in mid-2020s might happen based on existing demand projections unless new LNG production project commitments are made soon.Japan continues to be the world's biggest LNG importer in 2017, while China moved into second place as Chinese imports surpassed South Korea's.

Total demand for LNG in China hit 38 million tonnes, thanks to continued economic growth and policies to reduce local air pollution via coal-to-gas switching. 

The company said that LNG market continues to meet expectations of many market observers, with demand growing substantially by 29 million tonnes to 293 million tonnes in 2017.

Maarten Wetselaar, Integrated Gas and New Energies Director, declared: "We are still seeing significant demand from traditional importers in Asia and Europe, but we are also seeing LNG provide flexible, reliable and cleaner energy supply for other countries around the world. In Asia alone, demand rose by 17 million tonnes. That's nearly as much as Indonesia, the world's fifth-largest LNG exporter, produced in 2017."

In 2017, the number of LNG spot cargoes sold attained 1,100 for the first time, equal to three cargoes delivered every day. This increase came mainly from new supply from Australia and the U.S. The company underlined that most suppliers are still looking for long-term LNG sales to obtain funding.
