WindSiemens Gamesa, Spain's leading wind turbine original equipment manufacturer (OEM), further strengthened its position in the market with 92 orders for the supply of 289 megawatts (MW) of wind turbines to five different customers, the company announced Monday."Most of these orders are for two of Siemens Gamesa's most cutting-edge and sought-after turbines: the SG 2.6-114 and the SG 3.4-132," a press statement said, adding the turbines would be installed at 10 wind farms being developed in Guadalajara, Lugo, Malaga, Zaragoza, Huesca, La Coruna and Cadiz.
 
The company will supply Grupo Jorge with 23 of its SG 3.4-132 turbines (82 MW) for the Coscojar II and El Aguila II wind farms located in the Zaragoza towns of Pedrola and Plasencia de Jalon, which it will service for 10 years.
 
Elsewhere, it will provide Viesgo with seven of its SG 3.4-132 turbines (24 MW) for the El Marquesado wind farm located in Puerto Real (Cadiz), a facility it will operate and maintain for 15 years.
 
"Under the terms of the agreement with the Comunidad General de Riegos del Alto Aragon, a public irrigation scheme, Siemens Gamesa will build the El Balson wind farm under an [engineering, procurement and construction] EPC arrangement, fitting it with nine SG 3.4-132 turbines for a total capacity of 31 MW," the statement said. This wind farm is being developed in Gurrea de Gallego (Huesca) in Aragon.
 
In addition, Siemens Gamesa will supply 25 turbines (19 SG 3.4-132 turbines and six SG 2.1-114 turbines) to an unnamed energy company for three wind farms located in Lugo, Malaga and Guadalajara, with an aggregate capacity of 79 MW.
 
Lastly, it will install another 28 of its SG 2.6-114 turbines for another energy company at three wind farms, two of which are in La Coruna.
 
Delivery of the new turbines will begin in October, and will vary depending on each project, according to the statement.
 
The company will also operate and maintain all of these new facilities, which fall under the scope of the renewable capacity allocated in recent auctions.
