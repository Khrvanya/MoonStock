  After a substantial rebound that's led oil prices to nearly  double from their February lows, some traders predict that the  crude comeback is coming to an end.   "I think we've bounced off resistance and it's time to get  short," Todd Gordon of TradingAnalysis.com said Wednesday on  CNBC's "Trading Nation."  Using the chart of oil-tracking ETF USO to make his point, Gordon  determines the level of resistance is at $12, just above  current prices.    Gordon notes that $12 would mark a "retracement" of roughly 50  percent of crude's decline from October to February. Many technical  analysts use such figures in order to determine important levels  on the charts.  The $12 level would also mark the pinnacle of a second uptrend  line that Gordon draws on the chart.   "Countertrend swings usually have equal leg movement," he said. "The first one was a move of just below $8 up to $11, about  $3."  After a drop back to about $9, "we're seeing a similar  $3 move," up to $12.  To trade the USO, Gordon encourages using options that expire in  three Fridays, on June 17. Specifically, he is buying the  12-strike put and selling the 10-strike put to create a bearish  put spread.   Because he is spending 58 cents on the trade in total, the maximum  loss is that amount, while his maximum gain comes if the USO  falls to or below $10, at which point Gordon makes $2 minus 58 cents, or $1.42. The trade breaks even if USO ends up at $11.42.  Still, if his thesis proves to be incorrect in the short term, he  won't wait for a turnaround.  "If we get back above the $12 mark in USO I'm going to cut the  trade, protect the premium, move to the side and look for the  next trade," he said.  Gordon's prediction comes ahead of Thursday's OPEC meeting in  Vienna, which could determine the oil market's next  move. Read MoreHow traders are playing a possible crude oil dip
