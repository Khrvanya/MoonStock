South Korean shares retraced losses late Tuesday afternoon, as  investors reacted to a televised speech by President Park Geun-hye offering to step down through a legal process, according to reports.   Park, who is embroiled in an influence-peddling scandal,  apologized and said she would step down from her position in  accordance with the law, asking legislators to aid her in handing over power  with minimal political unrest, said Reuters.   The scandal broke out when reports said Park's friend,  Choi Soon-sil, who holds no post in the government, provided her  advice on state affairs, suggesting Choi also had access to  classified material related to national security and economic  policies. Since then, hundred of thousands have protested in South  Korea, calling on her to quit or be impeached.   The benchmark Kospi climbed 0.18 percent following Park's speech after previously falling near 0.2 percent. At market close, the index gave up the gains to close flat. The Kosdaq index finished up 3.02 points, or 0.51 percent, at 596.07. The Korean won strengthened from levels near 1,170 to around 1,168.50 after the announcement.   Meanwhile, Japanese markets slipped, despite the release  of government  data hinting at a stabilization in domestic  demand.   The country's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was steady in  October at 3 percent, the same level as August.   Household spending in Japan fell 0.4 percent on-year in October,  but it fell at a slower pace than the median estimate for a 0.6  percent decline, according to Reuters. Separately, retail sales  slipped 0.1 percent on-year for the same month, falling less than  the Reuters median estimate for a 1.2 percent annual drop.   The  closed down 49.85 points, or 0.27 percent, at  18,307.04, while the Topix fell  1.01 points, or 0.07 percent, to 1,468.57. Japanese shares were  likely pressured by a slightly stronger yen, which traded  at 111.98 against the dollar on Tuesday afternoon in Asia,  climbing from levels near 113.00 in the previous week.   Major exporters sensitive to the yen closed mixed. Among  automakers, Toyota fell 0.20  percent, Honda was off  by 0.54 percent and Mazda fell 1.02  percent. Electronics maker Sharp was down  1.08 percent, while Canon and Nikon climbed  0.40 and 1.87   percent, respectively.   The rest of Asian markets were mixed, taking cues from the U.S.  where a post-election rally appeared to stumble. Traders also  looked ahead to key global events set to take place this week,  including a meeting on Wednesday between the world's largest oil  producers and the release of the U.S. nonfarm payroll report on  Friday.   Australia's benchmark ASX  200 finished down 6.9 points, or 0.13 percent, at  5,457.50, while Hong Kong's  was down 0.19 percent. Chinese mainland markets  were mixed, with the  composite closing up 6.36 points, or 0.19  percent, at 3,283.36 and the Shenzhen composite fell 16.46 points, or 0.77  percent, to 2,110.36.

In the currency market, the dollar pulled  back against a basket of currencies to trade at 101.24, after  falling to 100.64 in the Monday session. That was down from  levels near 102.00 in the previous week.   The slip in the dollar saw other major currencies trade higher;  the Australian  dollar was at $0.7481, up from levels below $0.7400 last  week and buoyed by higher metal prices. The euro was at  $1.0607, climbing from below $1.055, while the pound traded  at $1.2412.  The  also strengthened to 6.8915 against the dollar,  after hovering near 6.9200 last week.

The pull-back across asset classes could suggest market watchers'  enthusiasm for the Trump administration was waning.   Stephen Innes, a senior trader at OANDA, said in a note that  traders were not rushing back to "reinstate long dollar just yet"  and were waiting for noteworthy U.S. fiscal stimulus clues from  the new Trump administration, while hedging fall-out risk from  the upcoming Italian referendum.   But some analysts pointed out that the change in direction was  more indicative of short-term market moves, rather than any  fundamental reassessment of what Trump's economic policies might  look like in practice.   "We are much more inclined to view the dollar-yen-led decline in  the dollar, modest dip in bond yields and softer stocks as more  reflective of short-term market positioning," Ray Attrill, global  co-head of foreign exchange strategy at the National Australia  Bank, said in a note.   In company news, shares of electronics giant Samsung finished flat at 1,677,000 won, after the  smartphone maker said in a statement on Tuesday it  was reviewing if it should  transition to a holding company structure.   The announcement comes after U.S. activist hedge fund Elliott  Management proposed in October that the company split itself into  a holding vehicle for ownership purposes and an operating  company, according to Reuters.   Samsung also said it will allocate 50 percent of its free cash  flow to shareholder returns for 2016 and 2017, and said it would  pay a dividend of 28,500 won ($24.36) per share in 2016, up 36  percent on-year.   Hong Kong-listed shares of Standard  Chartered fell 0.81 percent after the South  China Morning Post reported the  British bank will cut one in every 10 of its global headcount in  corporate and institutional banking as it makes a new effort to  reduce overheads to restore profitability.   Shares of HSBC also  dropped 1.22 percent in Asia.   The Bank of  England is set to unveil on Wednesday the results of  stress tests done on the performances of seven major UK  banks. Some analysts  expect HSBC and Standard Chartered to be the most at  risk of failure due to an exposure to Chinese credit.   Oil prices pulled back on Tuesday during Asian hours, after  gaining more than 2 percent during the U.S. session on Monday,  ahead of OPEC's official  meeting Wednesday.   On Sunday, Saudi Arabian energy minister Khalid al-Falih had cast  fresh doubts over the cartel's ability to agree a proposed  production cut when he said the oil market, currently suffering  from a supply glut, would re-balance in 2017 even without  intervention from producers, reported Reuters.   Meanwhile, a Monday meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC producers  was called off after Saudi Arabia declined to attend, Reuters  added.
