WindThe Spanish region of Galicia will end 2019 with 480 MW of newly installed wind power provided by some 20 new wind farms that have reached the final stage of construction, according to local wind association EGA.The association said last week its goal is to have 500 MW installed every year until 2030. With new wind farms commissioned by the end of 2019, Galicia will circle 4,000 MW of installed wind capacity.
 
EGA highlighted that in 2020, half of Galicia's wind farms will have been in service for more than 15 years, making them ripe for repowering. To address the repowering challenge, the association demands fiscal aid, streamlined administrative process and greater evacuation capacity.
 
According to the 2018 sector report by Spanish wind association AEE, Galicia ranked third in Spain by installed capacity last year, with 3,422 MW divided between 161 wind farms, behind the regions of Castile and Leon and Castilla-La Mancha. The entire country had a total of 23,484 MW of installed wind power at the end of 2018.
