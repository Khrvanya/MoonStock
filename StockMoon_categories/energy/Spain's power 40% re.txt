RenewableThe share of renewables in power generation in peninsular Spain this year is estimated at 40%, up from 33.7% in 2017, thanks to wind farms and increased output from hydropower plants (HPPs).Grid operator Red Electrica de Espana (REE) last week presented provisional data for 2018, saying that wind will again be the second most important source of power for Spain in 2018, with a share of 19.8%. Nuclear energy will remain number one with 21.4%.
 
The past year has been rainier so the contribution of HPPs to the mix jumped to 13.7% from 7.4% in 2017. At the same time, the share of coal power is expected to be down by 2.6 percentage points to 14.5%.
 
At the end of the year, peninsular Spain had 98.65 GW of power generation capacity. Its power demand is estimated at 254,074 GWh in 2018, up by 0.6% year-on-year. Non-peninsular demand from the islands will reach 15,320 GWh.
