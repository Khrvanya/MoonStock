NuclearSpain's Nuclear Safety Council (Consejo de Seguridad Nuclear, CSN) and the Moroccan Nuclear and Radiological Safety and Security Agency (AMSSNuR) have inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on enlarged cooperation.Even though Spain and Morocco maintained regular contact for more than the past ten years on issues concerning nuclear regulation, no collaboration accord has previously been signed between parties. This was because of the lack of a single regulatory authority.
The Moroccan government approved plans to establish a nuclear safety agency and draft a law on nuclear security in January 2011. The structure was called AMSSNuR and was founded in 2016 as an independent regulatory body. The plenary of the CSN authorized the content of the Memorandum of Understanding, which sets a framework for the bilateral exchange of information.
CSN President Fernando Marti and AMSSNuR Director General Khammar Mrabit inked the MoU on 15 January at the offices of the Moroccan Ministry of Energy and Mines in Rabat.
The document includes aspects such as operational experience and conclusions made from nuclear accidents, response and communication in emergency situations, the reduction of risk of severe accidents and the management of their consequences, research and development.
Morocco possesses a 2 MW Triga research reactor under construction at Mamoura close to Rabat and has earlier considered the institution of nuclear energy.
