CoalThe Spanish authorities are against the decision taken by Iberdrola, the most important electricity provider, to close two coal-fired power sites. This vision is contrary to the Paris Agreement on climate change.A strange debate occurs between the ruling Iberic government and Iberdrola on coal phase-out. The main electricity supplier committed to shut down Iberdola's coal power stations, including the two Spanish power units, in Lada in Asturias and Velilla, located in the independent community of Castilla y Leon. 

The Spanish firm's intention is to become carbon free by 2050, with a 50% cut of its emissions in 2030 compared to 2007, and investments of EUR85 billion in green energy at overall. 

Iberic representatives showed no support to country's biggest electricity provider, as the energy ministry elaborated a decree on the procedure of closure of energy facilities, which introduces new and very restrictive rules on closing an electricity production plant: a unit cannot be closed if it is offering revenues, or if its closure represents a danger to the security of supply, or if power prices might increase.
 
Like the rest of the EU, Spain is a signatory of the Paris Agreement, which engages the EU countries to reduce 40% of its emissions by 2030 and, above all, to review the aim of each state to limit the surge in the temperatures between 1.5deg and 2deg.  

Iberdrola underlined that the engagement to extract coal stays in force after a meeting with the country's energy minister. The official motivates their anti-coal-phase-out attitude by the liquidation of 200 jobs, but Iberdrola ensured that the work places lost would be fully redirected according to reclassifications. This makes the reaction of the government all the less reasonable. The dispute regarding the risk of electricity shortages is not very convincing, as the Iberic state is today in a situation of electrical overcapacity after major investments in renewables.

As the global temperature continues to increase, one of COP23's most remarkable initiatives has been that of the Coalition Alliance, submitted by the United Kingdom and Canada and accepted by twenty other countries, except for the Spanish state.
