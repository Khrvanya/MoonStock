  The U.S. consumer will be in focus Tuesday as Wall Street eyes  some related economic reports and earnings. Investors also will watch for indications on oil prices and the  path of Fed tightening, with key policymakers scheduled to speak  throughout the day.   Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, said the  consumer confidence figure is most important to him of the  reports scheduled for Tuesday.   "If consumer confidence starts to unwind, that could be  concerning because now the negative weight from Wall Street is  starting to spill over into Main Street," he said.
