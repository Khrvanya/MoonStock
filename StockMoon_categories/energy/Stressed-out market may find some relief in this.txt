Stressed-out markets will get a look Wednesday at the health of  the U.S. services sector, a part of the economy considered to be  the engine that will keep the country from falling into recession.  Economists expect the ISM nonmanufacturing index will fall to  55.1, from 55.3 in December, when it is reported at 10 a.m. ET.  The ISM has not been below December's level since April 2014.  Any number above 50 shows expansion. There is also ADP payrolls  data at 8:15 a.m., a warm up to Friday's government report,  and Markit services PMI data at 9:45 a.m. China also has  services PMI data overnight.  Oil weighed heavily on markets Tuesday, but was trading higher Wednesday morning. Traders await oil inventory data from the U.S. government at 10:30 a.m. ET after the American Petroleum Institute reported another  larger–than-expected build in supply late Tuesday.
