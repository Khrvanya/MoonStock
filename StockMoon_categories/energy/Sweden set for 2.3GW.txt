WindWind farms with a combined generation capacity of more than 1GW were approved in Sweden during the first quarter of 2019, putting the Nordic country on track to double its wind generation capacity by 2022.Final investment decisions were made on 1225MW worth of projects in the period from January to March, up from 550MW on-year, according to the Swedish Wind Energy Association.
 
The association expects 2329MW of new capacity to be added in the 2019 calendar year, bringing total capacity to 9724MW by year-end.
Swedish wind power production currently stands at 19TWh and SWEA expects it to rise to 38TWh by 2022.
 
"Wind power is now a full-fledged technology that can be built without support," said SWEA chief executive Charlotte Unger Larson.
 
Among the biggest projects currently under development is Enercon's 844MW Maximus in the country's north, which is slated to go live by the third quarter of 2021.
