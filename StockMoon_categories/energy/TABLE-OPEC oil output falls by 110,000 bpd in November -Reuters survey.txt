LONDON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The following table shows crude oil output by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in millions of barrels per day (bpd) in November and December, according to a Reuters survey published on Friday. OPEC, Russia and other non-members, an alliance known as OPEC+, agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd in 2019. OPEC's share of that cut is 800,000 bpd among the 11 members participating in the deal. The November survey indicates that total OPEC output fell by 110,000 bpd. Compared with the levels from which they agreed to cut, which in most cases was October 2018 output, the 11 members have reduced production by 1.235 million bpd. Given the pledged reductions total was 814,000 bpd, that equates to 152% compliance. October compliance was 135%. October's estimate was revised up by 90,000 bpd due to new information about output in Iran and Ecuador.November    October    Baseline   Pledged     Cut        Compliance  2019output      output    for cut    cut         achieved   (%)*        target***Algeria          1.02        1.02     1.057      32,000      37,000     1161.025Angola           1.25        1.39     1.528      47,000      278,000    5911.481Congo            0.34        0.35     0.325      10,000      -15,000negative    0.315Ecuador          0.50      0.46 (R)   0.524      16,000      24,000     1500.508Eq.

Totals are rounded.*Compliance is calculated by the following method in the table above. Baseline for cut minus November output = cut achieved. Cut achieved divided by pledged cut = percentage compliance.**Iran, Libya and Venezuela are exempt from making voluntary output cuts.***Targets and pledged cuts apply from Jan. 1, 2019, and are as published on OPEC's website apart from a revised target for Nigeria which emerged in October 2019. The Reuters survey aims to assess crude supply to market, defined to exclude movements to, but not sales from, storage. Saudi and Kuwaiti data includes the Neutral Zone. Venezuelan data includes upgraded synthetic oil. Nigerian crude output is defined to include the Agbami and Egina streams and exclude Akpo condensate.(Reporting by Alex Lawler and Rania El Gamal, Editing by Editing by)
