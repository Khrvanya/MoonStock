LONDON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The following table shows crude oil output by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in millions of barrels per day (bpd) in December and November, according to a Reuters survey published on Monday. December was the last month in which a deal between OPEC, Russia and other non-members, an alliance known as OPEC+, to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd in 2019 took effect. OPEC's share of that reduction was 800,000 bpd. A new production cut agreement started on Jan. 1 this year. The December survey indicates that total OPEC output fell by 50,000 bpd from November. Compared with the levels from which they agreed to cut, which in most cases was October 2018 output, the 11 members have reduced production by 1.29 million bpd. Given the pledged reductions total 814,000 bpd, that equates to 158% compliance. November's revised compliance was 153%.1.0251.4810.3150.5080.1230.1814.5122.7241.77410.3113.07226.026NOTES: (R)  Revised. Totals are rounded and may not add.*Compliance is calculated by the following method in the table above. Baseline for cut minus December output = cut achieved. Cut achieved divided by pledged cut = percentage compliance.*Iran, Libya and Venezuela are exempt from making voluntary output cuts.***Targets and pledged cuts apply from Jan. 1, 2019, and are as published on OPEC's website apart from a revised target for Nigeria which emerged in October 2019. The Reuters survey aims to assess crude supply to market, defined to exclude movements to, but not sales from, storage. Saudi and Kuwaiti data includes the Neutral Zone. Venezuelan data includes upgraded synthetic oil. Nigerian crude output is defined to include the Agbami and Egina streams and exclude Akpo condensate.(Reporting by Alex Lawler Additional reporting by Rania El Gamal, Editing by David Evans)
