  Saudi Arabia's 30-year-old deputy crown prince may have already  tanked any hope of an oil deal.Oil-producing countries from inside and outside of OPEC hope to  strike a deal this weekend to freeze production in order to  stabilize the price of crude. Since Saudi Arabia, Russia and others  first agreed to a meeting in February, oil prices have been  supported at somewhat higher levels.  Other than Russian President Vladimir Putin, there's no single  individual seen as having more sway over the world oil market,  and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman is critical to the  success or failure of this weekend's meeting in Doha, Qatar.
