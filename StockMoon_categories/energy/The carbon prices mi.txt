CoalThe new Thomson Reuters study reveals that Europe's withdrawal from coal will lower prices for carbon allowances for a period of at least 13 years. 
According to the study, many European nations get rid of carbon-intensive fuel from their electricity mixes, and correspondingly, the demand for carbon allocations will decline.

Coal power accounted for 23% of the electricity mix in Europe in 2016, but at the same time it released almost 40% of total EU emissions.
 
In these terms, many EU member states have created strategies to eliminate intensively coal to reduce emissions, invest in low-cost alternative sources and improve energy efficiency.

Jon Berntsen, Senior Analyst at Thomson Reuters, said that if the emphasizing exclusion of coal will continue, the EU carbon allowances will show up EUR14/ton(PS12.4/ton), or a much lower price curve throughout the trading period ending in 2030.

He added that in the case of a total phase-out by 2030, carbon prices are estimated to be lower than today's level of EUR7/ton(PS6.2/ton).
