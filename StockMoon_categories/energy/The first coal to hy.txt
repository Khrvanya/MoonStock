HydroA multi-billion-dollar project has been launched by Japanese and Australian governments aiming to produce liquefied hydrogen from coal for Japan's southeastern region.The Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain (HESC) consortium, managed by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, including J-POWER, Iwatani Corporation, Marubeni Corporation and Australian company AGL, will run the project.

The project's construction in Victoria is likely to begin in 2019.

According to the announcement made by HESC, the first delivery of hydrogen, from the pilot, is expected in 2020-2021.

Hydrogen is the clean energy commodity of the future, and a reliable solution to the energy and climate change problems worldwide.

According to the statement, Australia already exports coal, iron ore and LNG. it can export, with the HESC project, the commodity of the future - hydrogen, which gives off no carbon emissions when used for power generation in fuel cells or gas turbines.

The Hydrogen Council declared that hydrogen could provide a fifth of global energy, in a $2.5 trillion market, by 2050. This is a sign of new economy development, and in ties between the two states.
