This week's chatter to cap oil output by  producers has eased investor's concerns, but the question remains: is the worst over for oil?   "The worst is behind us; I don't think it's completely over yet,"  Kevin Norris, president of Univest Wealth Management, told CNBC's  "Power Lunch" on Friday.  Oil prices remain under pressure due to oversupply, and a possible freeze  in oil output at record levels will only exacerbate the current  glut, he said. Norris, who calls for  production cuts from OPEC, sees opportunity in the multinational  oil and gas company Exxon Mobil.   "We like Exxon from the flight-to-quality perspective," he said. "It's a solid integrated oil producer, [has] a solid  balance sheet ... and it could be the beneficiary of a  shakeout in the energy sector."  Norris' comments come as energy company defaults are rising in  the face of low oil prices. Meanwhile, oil companies have been forced to lay off employees. BP last month said it was cutting thousands of  jobs. Norris, who  manages $3 billion in assets, suggests that while many other  companies may not hold up, "a quality company" such as Exxon is  set to succeed. The company's stock is up nearly 6 percent  year to date.  On the other hand, Matt Roddy, vice president  and portfolio manager at Rockland Trust, likes Alphabet, parent company of Google.   While Alphabet has seen about a 10 percent pullback  recently, its new CFO is reorganizing it, Roddy told  "Power Lunch."The company's fourth-quarter earnings beat analysts expectations. Alphabet's stock rose modestly Friday.  Disclosure: It could not be immediately ascertained if  Norris or Roddy have positions in the companies  mentioned.  Disclaimer
