  Oil prices plunged nearly 8 percent Monday thanks to  developments in Greece, China's stock market woes and the  potential for more supply from Iran, but the worst may be over,  according to an industry expert.   "The decline that we experienced today is all out of measure to  what it is that the market is actually telling us," Kent Moors,  executive chair of Money Map Global Energy Symposium, said  Monday. "I think that this is more in terms of a psychological  collapse, more than anything else."   In an interview with CNBC's "Closing Bell," Moors forecast oil prices to  hit between $75 and $85 a barrel by the end of the year. "Demand,  when all is said and done, for this year will come in higher than  at any point OPEC or IEA has ever calculated," Moors said.     He cautioned, however, that it will take some time for crude  prices to recover from what he called a "triple whammy,"  referring to Greece's debt referendum, Beijing's intervention in its stock markets and oversupply fears related to Iran.   West Texas Intermediate closed down 7.7 percent at  $52.53 a barrel.

Of the headwinds, Moors said the Iranian situation  is the least serious.   "If we had an agreement tomorrow, there won't be any appreciable  Iranian additional volume in the market for at least 18 months,"  Moors said. Oil falling on news related to the nuclear deal "is a  perceptual thing, but it has no substance."Read MoreGreecein 'much worse situation': Papandreou  Looking forward, Moors said oil demand is increasing  internationally. He said the bulk of the demand is moving toward  Asia, a trend he expects to continue until 2035.  —Reuters contributed to this report.
