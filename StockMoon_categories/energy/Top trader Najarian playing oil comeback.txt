  CNBC "Halftime  Report" trader Jon Najarian bought shares of Noble Energy on Friday, as investors appear to eye energy stocks as an area of opportunity.   Najarian, whose CNBC Pro Model Portfolio is up 7 percent this year, believes the bulls are shopping for more upside on ticker NBL, in particular.   In the past 12 months, shares of the oil and gas driller plunged 56 percent, weighed by sharp losses in the energy complex on oversupply concerns.
