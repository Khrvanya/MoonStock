Oil MarketTotal and ExxonMobil will drill the first deepwater well in a block offered at a Mexican hydrocarbon auction held in October.The energy firms have found a potential ultra-deepwater structure named Etzil at Block 2 of the Perdido Fold Belt, Mexico's National Hydrocarbon Commission.
 
The identified composition  represents one of the most abundant structure identified in an exploration program authorized by CNH to date of blocks granted at Mexico's deepwater hydrocarbon auction Round 1.4 in December 2016.
 
Total and ExxonMobil has predicted Etzil has 50% possibility of having as much as 2.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent(boe).
 
Statoil, Total and BP have discovered two other deepwater fossil fuels in Mexico's Cuenca Salina basin -- Hunab with 397 million boe and Serrano with 325 million boe of prospective resources.
 
As the block's operating structure, Total presented CNH two exploration programs. The first is drilling only Etzil-1 with a total depth of 7,000 meters. The second plan is to drill Etzil-1 and another well at the end of 2020, each with a depth of 4,900 meters.
 
Until now, CNH has offered 27 deepwater blocks between Round 1.4 and 2.4, possessing 30 billion boe of potential resources.
