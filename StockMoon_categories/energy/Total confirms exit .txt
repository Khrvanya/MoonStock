Natural GasFrench oil major Total has confirmed its withdrawal from a $4.8 billion Iranian gas project, leaving the door open for co-investor China National Petroleum Company to take the lead on the asset."Total has notified the Iranian authorities of its withdrawal from the contract following the 60-day period specified in the contract to obtain a potential waiver from the US authorities," a Total spokeswoman told The National. "Despite the backing of the French and European authorities such waiver could not be obtained."
 
The French energy company had the majority stake alongside the Chinese state oil company as well as local operator Petropars to produce gas and condensate from phase 11 of South Pars, the world's largest gas field that is shared with Qatar. The agreement signed in 2016 following the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions over Tehran was touted as a big win for the beleaguered Iranian energy sector.
