LNGFrench energy major Total and compatriot shipping company CMA CGM have signed an agreement for the supply of approximately 270,000 tonnes of LNG per year over ten years.Total said that this volume would cover the supply at Marseille-Fos of CMA CGM's future 15,000-TEU container ships that will operate between Asia and the Mediterranean, scheduled for delivery starting in 2021.
 
As part of this agreement, Total will provide a suitable solution for the bunkering of these containerships with the positioning of an LNG bunker vessel at the port of Marseille-Fos and a complementary bunkering solution in Singapore.
 
These new supply chains will further expand the use of LNG as a marine fuel, particularly in the Mediterranean Sea.
 
The first in this series, the CMA CGM Jacques Saade, the world's first ultra-large capacity LNG-powered container ship, was launched on September 25, 2019.
