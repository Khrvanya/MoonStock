HydroToyota intends to construct in California what it considers to be the first in the world MW-scale green energy and hydrogen generation facility.The vehicle producer will utilize the Tri-Gen site to convert bio-waste into water, electricity and hydrogen to run its operations at the Port of Long Beach.

When it starts operating in 2020, it is likely to produce approximately 2.35MW of electricity and 1.2 tonnes of hydrogen per day, enough to power the equivalent of around 2,350 average-sized households and satisfy the daily driving needs of almost 1,500 vehicles.

Toyota's fuel cell vehicles in the port, counting new deliveries of the Mirai sedan and its heavy duty hydrogen truck, will be supplied by the plant.

Doug Murtha, Group Vice President of Strategic Planning, declared: "For more than 20 years, Toyota has been leading the development of fuel cell technology because we understand the tremendous potential to reduce emissions and improve society. Tri-Gen is a major step forward for sustainable mobility and a key accomplishment of our 2050 environmental challenge to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide emissions from our operations."
