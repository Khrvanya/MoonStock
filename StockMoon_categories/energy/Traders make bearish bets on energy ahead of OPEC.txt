  Traders are making some bearish bets on the energy space ahead of  Wednesday's big OPEC meeting.  "There's been a lot of put buying in [the XLE and XOP] energy  ETFs," Dan Nathan of RiskReversal.com said Monday on CNBC's "Fast  Money." "It looked to be short-term hedging in front of this OPEC  meeting on Nov. 30."Oil closed Monday's session in the green, but doubts over  OPEC's ability to agree on a production cut swiftly sent prices  tumbling Tuesday.  According to Nathan, there's an oil stock in particular that one  trader believes could continue to fall in the next few weeks:  Halliburton.  In the eyebrow-raising wager, he noted that someone bought 5,000  of the December 49-puts for $1.45 per options contract. This is a  bearish bet that Halliburton could fall to $47.55, down about 1.6  percent from current trading levels. The stock hit a low of  $47.06 Tuesday before bouncing back to around $48.30.    "This thing is in a very nice uptrend, I expect this trader is  waiting for a move kind of back to those recent lows," Nathan added.
