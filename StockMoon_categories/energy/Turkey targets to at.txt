WindTurkey intends to reach an investment of $5 billion in wind power by the end of the year with the aid of 1 gigawatt (GW) offered from Turkish Renewable Energy Resource Zone Project (YEKA) together with the concluded wind energy tenders of around 3 GW capacity, as stated by Turkish Wind Energy Association on Friday.Mustafa Serdar Ataseven, TUREB President, said that Turkey's wind energy installed capacity will be enhanced via ongoing projects and scheduled tenders that will be completed by the end of December. The next pre-license tender for 2,130 megawatts will be delivered over a five-day period commencing on Monday, December 25, to support electricity production at convenient prices for Turkish consumers.

The projects will be accomplished in three to four years after which operations can begin to offer benefits for consumers. Turkey can reach 7 GW of installed capacity by the end of the year. He added that financial backing should continue to value Turkey's wind energy potential, which according to his opinion is more than double than that of the actual installed capacity. 

Turkey has reserves of around 11GW of wind power available and a national target of 20 GW of installed capacity by 2023, he said. The country's total energy target for 2023 is 100 GW of capacity. 

Between June 21 and 23 during the three-day period, wind energy pre-licenses were put up for tender, and more than 200 green energy companies joined the rally for a total of 710 MW in wind capacity. 

Tenders for 11 regions in Turkey have been awarded by Turkish Electrical Transmission Company (TEIAS) in the company's center in Ankara.

Turkey's first 1,000-megawatt wind tender was realized in Ankara on the 3rd of August in which a Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy - Turkerler - Kalyon Energy conglomerate gained the tender presented by YEKA. 

The price offered at Turkey's first 1,000-megawatt wind tender was fixed at $3.48 per kilowatt-hour of electricity generation and exceeded the latest figure of $10.30 per kilowatt-hour.
