Natural GasTurkey will add the biggest regasification capacity in Europe by 2019, as indicated in Gas Infrastructure Europe's (GIE) LNG Map and Database 2018.At present, there are 32 LNG terminals working in Europe, out of which 27 are situated in the EU-28 area. These terminals are distributed along the coasts of 15 countries.

According to GIE statistics, Turkey, which has an existing regasification capacity of 17 bcm/y, will add 21 bcm/y of regasification capacity by 2019 with the Floating Storage Regasification Units (FSRU) projects in Iskenderun and Saros Bay.

Great Britain with 17 bcm/y of LNG additional capacity, will follow Turkey, to add to the existing regasification capacity of 48 bcm/y. The LNG is very important in facilitating the transition to the renewable energy. It is also a green alternative fuel for sea, waterway and road types of transportion.

The members of Gas LNG Europe (GLE) saluted the Paris Agreement and they are persuaded that the LNG industry can help meet the COP21 commitments.

 In December 2015, at the Paris climate conference (COP21), 195 countries adopted the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate agreement. The deal established a global action plan to put the world on the path to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to much lower than 2 degrees Celsius.
