They report work on the pipeline is on schedule and that it is 90% complete and should go online before the end of the year.Turkish Stream is part of a trident of pipelines running from Russia to Europe to supply gas to Gazprom's main customers. Turkish Stream expands the southern route and is an addition to the Druzhba pipeline that runs through Ukraine and has been the main conduit since Soviet times. More controversial is the construction of the 55 billion cubic metre (bcm) Nord Stream 2 pipeline that runs under the Baltics and has been the subject of bitter political wrangling.
 
The capacity of the Turkish Stream project is 31.5bcm. It will deliver gas from Russia's southern region to Turkey and then on to southern Europe.
