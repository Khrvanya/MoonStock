Natural GasAccording to a senior Turkmen energy official, Turkmenistan might convey natural gas to Eastern Europe via Russia, after Moscow stopped purchasing gas from the Central Asian nation.Russia's block of energy imports has left Turkmenistan with China as the only acquirer of its gas, tightening its economy because of a decrease in hard currency income.
 
Myrat Archayev, Chief Executive of Turkmengas state energy company, said at an energy conference in Ashgabat that Russia role as a transit state rather than a buyer represented an option, but did not state whether any discussions with Moscow were undergoing in this sense. 

He affirmed: "We have a working system of pipelines running in the northern direction through which Turkmenistan historically exported natural gas to Russia and other CIS countries," meaning ex-Soviet nations such as Ukraine. Also, Archayev added: "If mutually acceptable agreements are achieved with buyers and transit countries, this existing pipeline can be used to ship natural gas from Turkmenistan to CIS countries and Eastern Europe,".

Turkmenistan produces approximately 70 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas annually and Russia used to purchase around 40 billion cubic meters of that. Last year, nevertheless, Turkmen exports represented only 37.3 bcm, of which 29.4 bcm were directed to China.
