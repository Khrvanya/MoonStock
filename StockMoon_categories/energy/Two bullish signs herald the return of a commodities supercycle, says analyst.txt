  The global supercycle in commodities that has lost steam in  recent years shows signs of revving up again, S&P Dow Jones  Indices' global head of commodities and real assets said Friday.  Jodie Gunzberg sees two bullish signals for commodities as  they come off their first positive year since 2012.  First, industrial metals have recently outperformed precious  metals by the widest margin in 26 years, according to S&P Dow  Jones Indices.  "That is very bullish. It shows investors are excited not only to  participate in the upside of the economic growth with  industrials, but they're willing to give up their positions in  gold as a safe haven to do it," Gunzberg told CNBC's "Fast Money:  Halftime Report."  Second, industrial and energy stocks combined have had their best  performance since 1999, S&P Dow Jones Indices reports.  "These are the two most economically sensitive sectors. The last  time that we saw this high of performance here, we saw an  eight-year bull run that returned 360 percent," she said.  Gunzberg said there is no reason for these trends to reverse  given expectations for higher U.S. economic growth, but she is  watching two key variables.  The first is OPEC's ability to manage oil production cuts in a bid  to reduce huge stockpiles and a global oversupply that has  cratered crude prices. The second is President-elect Donald  Trump's capability to deliver policies that boost economic  growth. Grain and gasoline prices  — two key  components of overall inflation — have been on the rise, so  the United States needs growth in infrastructure spending and  employment in order to avoid stagflation, or a period of rising  prices paired with weak GDP gains and high unemployment, Gunzberg  said.  The dollar also needs to come down from multiyear highs, she said. A weaker greenback boosts demand for dollar-denominated  commodities by making them more affordable to holders of other  currencies.
