NuclearThe UK Government should provide subsidies to developers of mini nuclear power stations like it did with the offshore wind industry.
 That's the recommendation of the Expert Finance Working Group (EFWG), an independent group convened by BEIS in January to consider what was needed to attract private financing to small reactor projects.
 
Small modular reactors (SMRs) generally have a capacity less than 600MW, with the costs ranging from PS100 million to PS2.3 billion, which the experts suggest could be delivered by 2030.

As ageing and polluting coal plants are set to close in the 2020s, the government is seeking low carbon alternatives to help meet the UK's emissions reduction targets.

The EFWG has recommended the government to help de-risk the small nuclear market to enable the private sector to develop and finance projects - it believes SMRs could be commercially viable propositions both in the UK and for an export market.

The offshore wind sector has seen a fall in costs over the years, which the EFWG says was in part due to the advanced manufacturing supply chain initiative which the government put in place and was used in combination with other mechanisms to support the industry.

It also suggests the establishment of an infrastructure fund, which could be "an effective way of sharing risk and overcoming financial constraints" making the small nuclear market more attractive to commercial financiers - as seen with offshore wind.

Ministers will consider the recommendations in this report and how they might inform the new framework for SMRs set out in the Nuclear Sector Deal.
