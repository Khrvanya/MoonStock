Natural GasFor the first time this month, the United Kingdom will receive direct delivery of Russian gas, after concerns for a winter supply crisis encouraged prices. The agreement is contentious as the Russian gas project, which is the provider, is under the US sanctions against Moscow.Great Britain is one of the first clients of the EUR22 billion project, which is the Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) facility, opened in Arctic last week by Russian President Vladimir Putin. It represents, according to Vladimir Putin, an important project that guarantees the future of Russia's economy.
