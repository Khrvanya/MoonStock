RenewableRenewable electricity accounted for a record of 29.8% of the British energy mix in the second quarter of this year. The government report describing this tendency and figures also indicates that green energy growth was caused  by the fact that coal production declined by half to a record level of 2.1%.The Renewable Energy Association (REA) examined the data and announced that while the development of solar capacity boosted by more than 50% between January and September 2015, still growth slumped to 18% between the same months in 2016 and this year, deployment between the same months raised only by 6%.

According to REA, this is because of the government policy limiting maths to market for solar technology, despite having previously recommended it was one of the less expensive forms of pure energy.

James Court, Head of Policy and External Affairs at the REA, declared: "This success has been facilitated by the rapid fall in cost for renewable technologies such as solar and wind, which are now the most cost-effective means of new power generation. He also added: "The government must address the policy barriers which have unnecessarily impeded their deployment over the last year and give the industry clarity around how the market will be structured in the 2020s."

Professor Dieter Helm published a report mentioning that consumers have not entirely benefitted from the decreasing costs of various energy technologies, counting renewables.
