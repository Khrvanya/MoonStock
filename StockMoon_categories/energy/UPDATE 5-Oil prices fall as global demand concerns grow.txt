* China seeks $2.4 billion in sanctions against U.S.* Russia reports oil output above OPEC+ quota in September* European shares rise as risk of no-deal Brexit recedes (Updates prices, adds comment)LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Monday, weighed down by concerns about economic growth and signs of ample global supplies.Global benchmark Brent crude was down 47 cents at $58.95 a barrel by 1153 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil declined 34 cents to $53.44 a barrel.U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators are working on nailing down a Phase 1 trade deal text for their presidents to sign next month, hoping to resolve a trade war that has rumbled on over the last year, slowing global economic growth.But, adding to tensions, China is seeking $2.4 billion in retaliatory sanctions against the United States for non-compliance with a WTO ruling in a tariffs case dating back to the era of President Barack Obama, a document showed."A rebound in upside potential looks unlikely at this stage given that bullish catalysts are in short supply," said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM."Only a meaningful U.S.-China trade agreement or deeper OPEC cuts will change the negative status quo, neither of which seem to be forthcoming," he said.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other oil producers, an alliance known as OPEC+, agreed in December to cut supply by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from the start of this year.Russia, the world's second-largest oil producer, said on Sunday it did not meet its supply reduction commitment in September because of an increase in natural gas condensate output as the country prepared for winter."Russia intends to fully comply with the agreed production cut in October, though it is reasonable to doubt whether this will actually be achieved," Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said."The only time this happened was between May and July when Russia was forced to scale back oil production due to contamination in the Druzhba oil pipeline," he said.China's economic growth slowed to 6% year-on-year in the third quarter, its weakest in 27-1/2 years.However, a 9.4% year-on-year increase in China's refinery throughput for September signaled that petroleum demand remained robust.Offering some encouragement, European shares opened slightly higher on Monday and UK government bond yields rose as investors remained hopeful Britain would avoid a disorderly exit from the European Union.Analysts have said any British-EU agreement that avoids a no-deal Brexit should boost economic growth and oil demand.
