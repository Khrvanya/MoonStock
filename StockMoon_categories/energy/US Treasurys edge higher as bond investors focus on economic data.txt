On the data front, personal income rose 0.4 percent in April, in line with expectations, and consumer spending increased by 0.4 percent."Bottom line, relative to expectations the only thing noteworthy was the upward revision in March spending as spending on durable goods was less negative and service spending was more than originally stated," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group."As for April, real spending surprised to the upside off the higher than expected March base but a savings rate that remains steady points to a consumer that is just trying to just live within their means," he said. Other data released Tuesday include consumer confidence reading for May, which came in at 117.9, slightly below a consensus estimate of 119.
