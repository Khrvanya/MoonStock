  Oil prices rose more than 4 percent to a three-week high on  Monday, bolstered by growing conviction that major oil producing  countries would agree to limit output at a meeting next week.  Brent crude oil briefly touched $49 a barrel. The London  benchmark has risen 11 percent in a week since Saudi Arabia, the  de facto leader of the  Organization of the Petroleum  Exporting Countries, started a diplomatic charm offensive to  persuade the group's more reluctant members to join its proposed  output plan.  In recent days, several OPEC members including Iran, along with  non-member Russia, have suggested they were leaning toward a deal  to limit output.  "When you've got all of the major players on board with a  production cut, obviously you're very close to getting a deal  done," said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures  Group in Chicago.  "You never know with OPEC — sometimes they go to the last minute  and there are a lot of false starts." Brent crude oil futures were up $2.12, or 4.5  percent, at $48.98 a barrel by 2:28 p.m. ET (1928 GMT), having  touched their highest level since Nov. 2, while U.S. West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude were up $1.73, or 3.7      percent, at $47.42 a barrel.  Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note that chances of an OPEC cut  succeeding have increased, and they believe the global oil  surplus will shift into a deficit by the middle of next year,  which would support prices.  "Our base case now is that an OPEC production cut will be  announced and implemented," they wrote. In late September, the  brokerage said conditions were not optimal for a cut to work.  Russian Vladimir Putin said he saw no obstacle to  non-OPEC member Russia agreeing to freeze oil output, which at  more than 11 million barrels per day is at a post-Soviet  high.  Meanwhile, OPEC members last week proposed a deal for Iran to  cap, rather than cut, output.  Iran has been one of the main hurdles facing any output  curtailment by OPEC, as Tehran wants exemptions to try to  recapture market share lost under years of Western  sanctions.   Libya and Nigeria, whose exports have been hampered by violence,  have also asked to be left out of any deal. A recovery in  production from both countries means the onus to cut rests on  Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbors. "While loose terms may be agreed, I remain skeptical that a full  detailed agreement can be both achieved and carried out by OPEC  given the clear differences that are so evident between certain  key members," OANDA markets strategist Craig Erlam said.  Barclays analysts said some form of deal was likely, but warned  an agreement could have little impact.    "We expect OPEC to agree to a face-saving statement ...   (but) U.S. tight oil producers can grow production at  $50-$55 (per barrel) and will capitalize on any opportunity  afforded to them by an OPEC cut," the bank said.        Hedge funds raised their net holdings of U.S. crude futures and  options for the first time in three weeks in the week to Nov. 15,  having delivered one of the largest cuts on record the previous  week. The move highlights the nervousness among investors about  betting heavily on oil in either direction.
