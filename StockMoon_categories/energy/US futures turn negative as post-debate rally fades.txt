U.S. futures traded near the flatline on  Tuesday after the first  debate between U.S. presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and  Donald Trump.   Clinton appeared to have gained an edge on her Republican  opponent in the debate, which saw Dow futures briefly add more  than 100 points before paring gains.   "The press verdict on the first U.S. presidential debate is that  Hillary Clinton 'won', but Donald Trump didn't lose badly enough  to really reduce the uncertainty," Kit Juckes, a strategist at  Societe Generale, said in a note on Tuesday. Dow futures rose more than 100 points overnight following the debate before dipping into negative territory Tuesday morning. S&P and Nasdaq futures soon followed the Dow lower.  Economic data due from the U.S. on Tuesday include the  Case-Shiller home price index and the Conference Board's consumer  confidence report for September.   Companies reporting earnings on Tuesday include IHS Markit, which reported before the bell, and Nike after the close of trade.  Crude oil  futures declined on Tuesday after rallying more than 3  percent on Monday. The volatility comes as major oil-producing  countries meet in Algiers amid rumors of a long-awaited OPEC deal  to freeze crude production.   With that in mind, energy stocks will be worth watching on  Tuesday.   Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.
