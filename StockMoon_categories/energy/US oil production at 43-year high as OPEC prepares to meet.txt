  U.S. oil production surged to a 43-year high, despite a price war  that resulted in a more than 50 percent reduction in active U.S.  oil wells.  Oil prices saw downward pressure in volatile trade Thursday  morning, after the Department of Energy reported a draw down in  crude inventories of 2.8 million barrels for the week ended May  22.   The DOE also reported that U.S. production rose to 9.566 million  barrels per day, surpassing the previous peak of 9.422 million  set in March. While no weekly data is available beyond 1983, the  production number is the highest, if translated to a monthly  basis, since May 1972.  From a supply and demand standpoint, record production in the  United States and record production of 10.3 million barrels a day  from Saudi Arabia in April continue to confirm that global  supplies are ramping up in the face of lower prices, not  falling.
