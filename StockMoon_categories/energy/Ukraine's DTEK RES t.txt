RenewableUkrainian renewables company DTEK RES expects to commission 500 MW of wind and solar power generating capacity in 2019 and to have a total of 1 GW the following year.Maksim Timchenko, the CEO of DTEK Group, unveiled this on Monday, as the group reported its performance in 2018. Last year, DTEK RES generated 677 million kWh of green power, which is 6.1% more than in 2017 thanks in part to a 4.8% higher output of the 200-MW Botievo wind farm.
 
The company is currently working on the 200-MW Primorsk, or Primorskaya, wind project, which is being realised in two stages. As previously announced, GE Renewable Energy will provide a total of 52 wind turbines of 3.8 MW each for the two phases of the wind farm on the Sea of Azov shore. DTEK Group anticipates to conclude work on the second stage late this year.
 
At the same time, the 200-MW Nikopolskaya solar power plant is close to being fully completed. DTEK said that 95% of the photovoltaic (PV) panels and 100% of the inverters have been assembled, while infrastructure construction has already been finalised. The plant is thus seen to be connected to the grid next month.
