SolarSwedish Vattenfall intends to make an investment of 1 billion Swedish kronor ($121.25 million) in large-scale solar energy production in the following two years.Vattenfall declared that the investments would help Vattenfall reach its target to turn into fossil-free within a generation.

The firm will financially back the expansion of new solar power plants, mainly large-scale between 2018 and 2019.

Magnus Hall, Vattenfall's president and CEO, declared: "Solar power is an important supplement to wind power as a renewable source of energy. We are now increasing the investment budget for solar power to satisfy our customers' increased interest and demand. From electricity consumers, who can obtain electricity from our future solar farms, but also from potential customers, who want to both consume and generate electricity from solar power." 

The company affirmed that there are two main sectors in which Vattenfall will concentrate its solar power investments, one in the development of large-scale solar PV parks, in locations where Vattenfall can use the current infrastructure to cut costs and the other in allowing customers to produce and consume their own solar energy.
