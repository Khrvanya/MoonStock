WindDenmark's Vestas Wind Systems A/S said today it will supply and install 106 MW of wind turbines across several sites in Greece as part of a single order from an unnamed customer.More specifically, Vestas will deliver and erect 14 units of the V136-4.2 MW, five V136-3.6 MW and eight V117-3.6 MW machines. It said that some of the V136-4.2 MW turbines will feature an anti-icing system to minimise ice formation on blades.
 
Marios Zangas, Head of Vestas Hellas, noted that this is the first time Vestas applies its expertise in cold climate solutions in a Mediterranean country such as Greece.
 
The company expects to ship the turbines in the second and third quarters of 2019, and commissioning is scheduled for the third quarter of that year. The order also includes a 20-year Active Output Management 4000 (AOM 4000) service agreement.
 
Vestas' current share of the local market exceeds 50%, having installed some 1.4 GW of wind turbines in Greece since entering the country in 1986.
