  Markets expect to hear from a dovish Fed on Wednesday, while a bubbling up of oil prices  makes weekly U.S. inventory data a bigger than normal focus.  For the stock market, the first notable report of the corporate  earnings season—Alcoa—is  expected after the closing bell. Earnings season gets into full  swing next week when major banks and technology companies  report.  The minutes of the Fed's March meeting are released at 2 p.m. ET.  Fed watchers hope to see more elaboration on the deliberations  that led Fed officials to signal a willingness to move towards  raising rates, and what it is they are looking for as a trigger  when they make the final decision.
