  The outcome of the Iowa caucuses could impact market sentiment,  as traders watch big oil earnings and car sales Tuesday.  "It's all about how the market responds to the Iowa caucuses,"  said Julian Emanuel, equity and derivatives strategist at UBS.  "Here's the question — when we get in tomorrow is the  political landscape more or less uncertain than it was today?  Ideally, we would like to see less uncertainty and think that's a  market positive."  Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, said one  reason stocks held little changed Monday was uncertainty ahead of  the Iowa caucus results. The market is looking for "by how much" a  candidate wins, she said.
