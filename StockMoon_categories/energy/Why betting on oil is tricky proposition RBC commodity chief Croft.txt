  While OPEC's key oil producers have been adhering to December's  output cut deal, which also included non-OPEC producers, strategist Helima Croft says investors shouldn't expect a big  breakout in crude prices this year.  The head of commodities strategy at RBC Capital Markets says the  main problem for the commodity remains "bloated  inventories."   "That's why we don't think we're going to break out into the $60s  or $70s anytime soon," Croft said Tuesday on CNBC's "Futures  Now." "We're going to grind higher, [but] it's really the  inventory that needs to be worked off to move much higher in  terms of prices in the near term."  A note released by RBC Capital Markets last week noted that oil  prices could hit $60, but that this 15 percent increase from  current levels will likely not happen until the end of the year.  The long-term price target reflects Croft's belief that because  of oil's inventory excess, the commodity will be moving "pretty  sideways" unless a major news story occurs.   "That's why I think this OPEC compliance meeting this weekend is  important," said Croft. "If there is some negative headline  coming out of that, that's a catalyst to have a sell-off." OPEC members surprised many by agreeing to cut production  of crude in December. But concerns that the cartel's  second-biggest oil producer, Iraq, will adhere to the deal have  left other countries nervous as to the agreement's future,  according to Croft.   Even if the accord is adhered to, U.S. production could cap  oil's gains.   "As a result of the increase in prices, we are going to see a  substantial amount of oil pouring into the market from the United  States," the International Energy Agency's executive director, Fatih Birol, told  CNBC.
