  The oil market is setting up for a prolonged period of low  prices, unless there's a dramatic shift in strategy by  producers.  Those producers range from Saudi Arabia and Iraq, to the upstart  shale drillers of Texas and North Dakota whose surprising success  initially set off a market share battle with the world's largest  oil exporters.  "What you're seeing now is the price crisis some had expected  last winter. Just a few weeks ago, confidence was coming back and  people were saying, '$70 was the new $100.' Reality intruded,"  said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS.
