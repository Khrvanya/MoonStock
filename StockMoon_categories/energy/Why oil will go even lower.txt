  New data showing a surge in U.S. gasoline and diesel fuel  supplies spell more trouble for oil prices but is good news for  consumers.  The Energy Information Administration on Wednesday reported that  U.S. gasoline stocks rose by 8.1 million barrels last week, compared with  expectations for a 3.4 million barrel build. Distillate stocks,  including diesel fuel and heating oil, rose by 11.2 million  barrels, more than five times the amount expected.  Gasoline futures for February slumped more than 2 percent on the Nymex to  $1.32 per gallon, but West Texas Intermediate oil futures rose  slightly to $48.62 per barrel even though the large supply of refined products means  lower demand for oil in coming weeks.
