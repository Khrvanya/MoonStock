  As the selloff in global markets converge with growth concerns to drive down oil prices, analysts are weighing the odds that OPEC could be forced into a production cut.   In the middle of mounting speculation that major oil producing countries  could cut output to put  a floor under falling prices, crude tumbled to fresh six and half year  lows on Monday. The moves followed last week's losses that drove U.S. light crude below the $40 mark on Friday,  with the international Brent contract following a similar path downward.  The next scheduled meeting for OPEC is not until December 4th  2015. Yet with oil getting walloped daily, some think it could come much sooner—and that the oil cartel may be forced to send a message to stanch the bloodbath in crude markets.  On Sunday, Iran's oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh said an emergency OPEC meeting could be  "effective" at stabilizing the price of oil,  according to Iran's news agency, Shana. The comment may have exposed underlying divisions among OPEC, as other members have thus far resisted the temptation to make any overt moves to tame oil.   On August 10, two OPEC delegates said there were no plans  for an emergency meeting, despite Algeria expressing a desire to, according to  a Reuters report. However, could OPEC be persuaded to budge  now?   According to some, a growing consensus is that it may come down  to one producer: Saudi Arabia.  Neil Atkinson, head of analysis at Lloyd's List Intelligence,  told CNBC that oil prices may have further to fall given the  abundance of supply over increasingly questionable global demand.  However, despite no signs of this trend going away soon, Atkinson  doesn't expect a coordinated cut by OPEC.  "If there were to be an OPEC meeting, it could only be with the  agreement of Saudi Arabia," Atkinson said. "That would represent  an extraordinary reversal—a screeching handbrake turn if you  like —as far as their policy is concerned."  "Although, (OPEC) have said consistently that were there to be a  wider agreement on oil production incorporating leading non-OPEC  producers as well as OPEC countries, they might be willingly to  talk about it, in other words, 'sharing the pain'," he added.    However, a lack of "central authority" in places like the U.S. to  determine national oil production, is where any hope of an  emergency meeting is halted, Atkinson said. "Without the U.S. being involved in the managed reduction of  production, it's difficult to see the Saudi's agreeing to  anything that would lower production."   Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at Energy Aspects, said that oil's current moves are more to do with broader macro  concerns about China and Asian growth rather than  oversupply.   "Yes OPEC is under a lot of pressure but I don't see Saudi Arabia  agreeing to an emergency meeting. The lower the prices are now,  the higher they will be in the future. It is maximum pain for  producers now," Sen told CNBC in an email. Meanwhile, other analysts backing this up with future prices - a  year out - pointing towards $47, suggesting markets are  already pricing in a recovery. Read MoreHoping for an OPEC  supply cut? Forget it  Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC markets, said that Saudi Arabia was "definitely feeling the heat" from the oil  drop, with additional pressure mounting after Fitch Ratings cut the country's outlook to "negative" from "stable". However, Lawler still  believes Saudi Arabia won't budge.  "There could be an emergency meeting but I don't see them caving  in with a production cut," Lawler said. The oil cartel "would lose all credibility if they  cut now and the policy probably wouldn't work in the long run  because they aren't the swing producer anymore," Lawler stated. "By November, if  oil prices are still at these levels then desperation may take  over and lead to a cut, simply because they would feel they don't  have a choice."   Kent Moors, executive chair of the Money Map Global Energy  Symposium, told CNBC last week that only Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and  United Arab Emirates "can afford to play this game." Together,  the trio control 15 million barrels per day worth of production,  the lion's share of OPEC output.

By that time, small  cash-poor U.S. oil producing companies are expected to feel a  "whammy" from falling oil prices. Afterward, he expects the large  multi-national producers to feel the effects as well.   If the differences between OPEC members, like Saudi Arabia and  Venezuela, continue to get worse, Moors added that "more and more  of the exports will be taking place outside of the cartel  dimensions."
