  As oil hovers near $50 per barrel, Pioneer Natural Resources has  become more optimistic and is planning for the return of five to  10 rigs, once it is confident the upturn in oil is more  sustainable.  "I think it is fair to say we're more optimistic than we were  last month and even the month before that. We're cautiously  optimistic that we're going to see improvement here in the second  half of the year," said Frank Hopkins, senior vice president of  investment relations at Pioneer.  Pioneer said in its earnings release last month that it is  "expecting to add five to 10 horizontal drilling rigs when the  price of oil recovers to approximately $50 per barrel and the  outlook for oil supply/demand fundamentals is positive."
