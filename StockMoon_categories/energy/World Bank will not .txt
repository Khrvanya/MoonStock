CoalPresident of the World Bank Group Jim Yong Kim confirmed that the international organization will not support a coal power plant in Kosovo.The Kosovo government stated in 2015 that the Ministry of Economic Development reached an agreement with the World Bank and US company Contour Global that would pave the way to a contract for building the plant.
 
In 2016, the World Bank told BIRN that they would only support the project after all relevant environmental, social, and technical analyses were conducted, and after consultations with the public and other shareholders.
 
After the Kosovo government signed a 1.3 billion euro-worth contract with Contour Global, the Kosovo Civil Society Consortium for Sustainable Development, KOSID, said that "the project would undermine Kosovo's European future," and that the government should work on developing efficient energy in Kosovo.
 
 
Due to the high cost of its construction, if the plant were to be built, Kosovo citizens would have to pay 50 per cent more for their energy bills, and that there would be a significant impact on the environment due to the burning of lignite as fuel.
 
Prime Minister of Kosovo Ramush Haradinaj said earlier this year that the plant had to be built despite environmental dangers, in order to produce energy locally.
