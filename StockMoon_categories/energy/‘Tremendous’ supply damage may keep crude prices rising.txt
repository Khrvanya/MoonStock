  Crude oil prices dipped on Friday, but the two-month trend  upwards is seen continuing by oil expert Amrita Sen.   The co-founder and chief oil analyst of Energy Aspects told CNBC  on Friday that cuts to supplies from non-OPEC countries would  help balance the market in the coming months.   Non-OPEC supplies have declined by around 1 million barrels per  day, according to Sen, largely due to unplanned outages in  Nigeria and Canada.   "I think the secular trend is higher," she told CNBC in  London.   "The damage we are doing to the non-OPEC supplies is tremendous  at this point in time … It is mainly because of all these  unplanned outages — Nigeria, in particular, where we are  losing nearly 700,000 barrels per day. But even if these  unplanned outages do get resolved — unlikely at this  stage — the underlying damage to the supply side is  tremendous," Sen later added.   She said crude prices had recovered faster than forecast.   This month, Goldman Sachs said WTI spot prices would rise faster  in the second-half of 2016 and 2017 than it had previously  expected, but the recovery would be shallower.   It raised its 2016 average forecast for WTI prices to $44.60 per  barrel, from the $38.40 predicted in March. However, the bank cut  its forecast for 2017 to $52.50 a barrel from $57.50.  Brent and WTI crude futures for July reached $50 per barrel on  Thursday for the first time since October but have since declined  to nearer $49 per barrel.   Sen said there might be a small correction in prices in the  near-term, despite the trend upwards.   "It needs to be a slow move higher — because inventories are  very high, any premature sharp increases in prices can of course  derail, ultimately, the rebalancing process," she told  CNBC.
