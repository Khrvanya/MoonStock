Aluminum Up on LME as Fiat Chrysler Floats Idea of an Aluminum Jeep WranglerThe next-generation Jeep Wrangler could make use of aluminum to cut weight, Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne told investors yesterday. The Toledo Blade reported that Marchionne said no vehicle in Chrysler's lineup could make better use of the light metal than the Wrangler, which is mainly produced in the company's Toledo area plant. The Wrangler will not get a redesign until 2017 so his candid remarks are just speculation at this point. FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering the Aluminum market.
