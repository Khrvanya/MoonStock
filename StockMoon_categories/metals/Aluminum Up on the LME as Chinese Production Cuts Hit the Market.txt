Aluminum Up on the LME as Chinese Production Cuts Hit the MarketIt was reported early this month that aluminum smelters in China are cutting production which could significantly improve the outlook for producers of the metal worldwide. China's aluminum smelters are likely to shut about 2 million tons of operating capacity in the coming months as they try to limit losses amid falling prices and dwindling government support. While the Beijing government allowing businesses to fail has roiled other commodities markets, doing so is a boon to aluminum which still has high demand from the aerospace and automotive industries and therefore a cut in the mass of Chinese aluminum production actually means higher prices for the existing metal producers.
