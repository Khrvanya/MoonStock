American steelHelter smeltersIN THE two months since America slapped tariffs of up to 30% on steel imports, President George Bush has had to put up with all sorts of threats and ridicule for saving America's steel industry. Now comes the sad news that Mr Bush's tariffs may have come too late. Big steel, it turns out, had already saved itself. Since the market hit bottom in late December, the price of a ton of hot-rolled steel has risen by more than 50% (see chart). In the past six months, shares in such firms as US Steel and AK Steel have nearly doubled. Capacity gluts have turned into supply shortages. Only trade barriers could prevent "a disaster that has already launched a parade to oblivion for virtually every American steel maker," thundered Leo Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers of America, in February. Now, those same steel firms are returning to profitability with unseemly haste. Mr Bush's tariffs have, of course, played a part in this rescue. But Mark Parr of McDonald Investments, an investment bank, ranks them only third or fourth in importance. First, says Mr Parr, a string of bankruptcies last year reduced supply at home. Domestic production of flat-rolled steel fell by about a quarter, for instance. Second, imports also fell sharply last year, thanks in part to a welter of anti-dumping duties. And third, demand for steel has stopped shrinking, and in the most crucial part of the market is even beginning to grow: Detroit is making more cars. The result? America now finds itself short of steel--by 8.5m tons, according to Mr Parr's arithmetic. Any offers?
