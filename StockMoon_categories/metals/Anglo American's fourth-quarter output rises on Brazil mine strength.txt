Anglo American's fourth-quarter output rises on Brazil mine strengthJan 23 (Reuters) - Anglo American on Thursday reported a 4% increase in fourth-quarter production, driven by a ramp-up at its Brazilian Minas-Rio mine, while water shortages at its Los Bronces mine in Chile weighed on the global miner's copper output. "We have delivered our full-year production targets across the business ... Increased production at Metallurgical Coal in Australia was offset by the drought in Chile," Chief Executive Officer Mark Cutifani said in a statement.
