Architectural Manufacturers’ Association Releases Anodized Aluminum GuideThe American Architectural Manufacturers Association (AAMA) recently released an updated document laying out the anodizing process with reference to architectural work. According to AAMA, this standard describes the anodizing process, which produces a coating that is thicker than nature's version, harder and very durable. The AAMA Anodic Finishes/Painted Aluminum (AFPA) document has been updated to reflect newer technologies now available for the process involved.FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering the metals markets of the Construction sector.The appearance and physical properties of anodic finishes are discussed as governed by three factors, which are aluminum alloy and temper, surface treatment prior to anodizing and the type of electrolyte and operating techniques used in the anodizing process."AAMA AFPA-1 was a retired AAMA document," said Andy Joswiak (Apogee Enterprises/Linetec), chair of the AMC Anodic Finishes/Painted Aluminum Task Group. "When the AAMA document CW-10 (Care and Handling of Architectural Aluminum from Shop to Site) was recently updated, it was decided to be streamlined by removing information that was not relevant to that specification. That information was important and was only available in the CW-10 specification."Joswiak said it was then decided to bring the AAMA AFPA reference document out of retirement and update it to include the important information removed from AAMA CW-10.
