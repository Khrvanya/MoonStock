Associated General Contractors Assists EPA With New Construction Compliance WebsiteGeneral contractors will have an easier time learning how to comply with federal and state environmental guidelines thanks to a new partnership with the  Environmental Protection Agency and the private sector. The partnership is between the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC), EPA and the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences (NCMS) will allow for a significant upgrade to the Construction Industry Compliance Assistance website, or CICA Center for short, association officials noted.FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering the metals markets of the Construction sector."Getting a construction project underway is challenging enough without having to figure out which environmental rules apply and how to comply with them," said Stephen E. Sandherr, CEO of the AGC. "This revamped site will make it a lot easier for contractors to take the necessary steps to comply with all environmental regulations for their projects."While many environmental laws establish federal standards as the minimum criteria needed to be met in order to ensure state compliance, there is still a different set of environmental laws in each of the 50 states. Letting contractors and other construction professionals know the compliance levels they need to meet in each state will be the mission of the new CICA website. The new website will focus on construction compliance, only, not design or planning compliance."EPA is pleased that AGC recognizes the value of the CICA Center and is assuming the oversight role and funding source for the website," said Lisa Lund, Director of the Office of Compliance in EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.As part of the partnership, the AGC will help finance upgrades to the website, originally launched in the mid-2000s with AGC's assistance. The upgrades will be designed to make it easier for contractors to comply with environmental regulations governing construction projects. Contractors will receive more comprehensive tools and the latest information on state and federal environmental requirements as well as green construction and environmental management programs.
