Australia's Newcrest says PNG gold project discussions back on trackFeb 11 (Reuters) - Australia's Newcrest Mining Ltd said on Tuesday the stay order restricting discussions with Papua New Guinea (PNG) over the Wafi-Golpu project mining lease has been lifted. PNG said in September it wants to keep 40% of gold produced from the proposed Wafi-Golpu project, creating a hurdle to an agreement with co-owners Newcrest Mining and Harmony Gold . Newcrest and Harmony look forward to re-engaging with PNG and progressing on discussions about the special mining license, Australia's largest listed gold miner said in a statement.
