Automotive MMI® Falls With Chinese Auto Sales, Stock MarketUS auto sales remain the bright spot in the drivers of the monthly Automotive MMI(r).Seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales for light vehicles rose to 17.8 million compared with 17.3 million a year earlier and was the highest since July 2005, according to researcher Autodata Corp. August was the fourth consecutive month that adjusted sales remained above the 17 million mark.The Automotive MMI(r) still registered only a value of 73 in September, a decrease of 3.9% from 76 in August. Weak prices for most of the base metals that make up the index (HDG, copper, aluminum and lead) abound despite strong end user sales in the US. In China, auto sales are falling with the rest of the domestic economy there.Need More Purchasing Information?

Zacks.com believes they intend to continue exploring for iron ore in Australia despite lower growth forecasts from China and weaker iron ore prices, betting on continued strength in iron ore demand over the long term.This is normal behavior from major miners such as the Big Three (Rio, BHP and Vale) and almost-there cousin Fortescue. They can make a profit by squeezing volume out of their mines at low prices based on scale, alone, but iron ore investment is coming from non-traditional miners, as well.India's Essar Steel is making a $1.9 billion investment in the steelmaking ingredient in Minnesota, of all places. It's difficult to imagine how such an investment makes long-term sense for Essar without a turnaround in both iron ore and steel prices. Since high-strength automotive steel alloys are one of the best-performing steel products on today's market, it's even more difficult to imagine those prices turning around without continued strong auto sales in the US and Europe and a turnaround in China and other emerging markets.Free Download: Compare Price Trends With the August MMI ReportFor exact pricing, join or log in below!Our Free MetalMiner Newsletter(c)2020 MetalMiner  All rights reserved. | Media Kit | Cookie Consent Settings | privacy policy | terms of service
