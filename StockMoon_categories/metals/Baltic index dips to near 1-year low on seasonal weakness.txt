Baltic index dips to near 1-year low on seasonal weaknessJan 22 (Reuters) - The Baltic Exchange's main sea freight index fell to its lowest since February on Wednesday, hurt by a seasonal slowdown in demand amid higher costs for shipowners due to a new regulation for shipping fuels. * The Baltic index, which tracks rates for capesize, panamax and supramax vessels ferrying dry bulk commodities, fell 66 points, or 9.6%, to 623. * The capesize index slipped 170 points, or 34.3%, to 325. * The capesize index registered its 29th consecutive session of losses, touching its lowest level since April last year. * Average daily earnings for capesizes, which typically transport 170,000-180,000 tonne cargoes including iron ore and coal, dropped $1,151 to $5,911. * "Fuel is getting much more expensive so ship-owners are struggling to make profit due to increased costs under the new International Maritime 2020 regulations," said Jo Ringheim, equity research analyst at Arctic Securities. * Tougher rules on sulphur emissions from ships came into effect in January, in the biggest shake-up for the oil and shipping industries for decades. * "We are heading into a softer seasonal period of the year with lower iron ore trade," Ringheim said, adding the Chinese new year holidays could also dent demand. * The panamax index fell 64 points, or 7.8%, to 760. * Average daily earnings for panamaxes, which usually carry coal or grain cargoes of about 60,000 tonnes to 70,000 tonnes, declined $574 to $6,844. * The supramax index fell by 6 points to 550 points.
