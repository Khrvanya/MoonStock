COMMODITY PRICE INDEX COMMODITY PRICE INDEX A squeeze on the copper market has eased. The premium paid for copper for immediate delivery on the London Metal Exchange widened to $210 a tonne last week, then narrowed to $60 a tonne this week, after metal was lent to the market. LME stocks rose for the first time since February. At present copper prices are underpinned by low world stocks and strikes in Chile and the United States. But Billiton Metals, a metal trader, reckons that the arrival of more cheaply produced copper will put the market back in surplus this year and next, despite strong Chinese imports. It forecasts that copper prices will fall to $1,760 a tonne next year, some 40% below its 1995 level. .
