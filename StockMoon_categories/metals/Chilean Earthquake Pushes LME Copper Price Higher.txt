Chilean Earthquake Pushes LME Copper Price HigherWhile Tuesday's Chilean earthquake does not seem to have hit the Chilean copper industry particularly hard, prices for the red metal jumped on the LME yesterday. Chile is the world's largest producer of copper and companies such as Sesa Sterlite and Hindalco have already reported little disruption to their supply chains but any disruption to such a large producer pushed prices up yesterday.
