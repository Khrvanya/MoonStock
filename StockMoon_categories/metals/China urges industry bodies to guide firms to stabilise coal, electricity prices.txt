China urges industry bodies to guide firms to stabilise coal, electricity pricesBEIJING, Feb 28 (Reuters) - China's state planner said on Friday that industry associations should guide member companies to stabilise the supply and prices of coal, steel, oil, gas and electricity and prevent regional shortages or sharp price increases caused by the return to work following a long holiday period. China is still restarting its factories and offices after an extended period of leave enforced over the coronavirus outbreak. The National Development and Reform Commission also said it would compile a list of small firms at risk of bankruptcy and encourage larger, quality companies to offer their support.
