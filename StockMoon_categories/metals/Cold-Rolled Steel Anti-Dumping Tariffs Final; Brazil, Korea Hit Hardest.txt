Cold-Rolled Steel Anti-Dumping Tariffs Final; Brazil, Korea Hit HardestThe Department of Commerce issued final anti-dumping and subsidy orders on Thursday, affirming and adding on to initial tariffs on cold-rolled steel flat products from Brazil, India, Korea, Russia, and the U.K. The duties are already in effect and will remain so for five years to counteract dumping and government subsidization.Two-Month Trial: Metal Buying OutlookCommerce determined that imports of cold-rolled steel from Brazil, India, Korea, Russia, and the U.K. have been sold in the U.S. at dumping margins of 14.43% to 35.43%, 7.60%, 6.32% to 34.33%, 1.04% to 13.36%, and 5.40% to 25.56%, respectively. Commerce also determined that imports of cold-rolled steel from Brazil, India, Korea, and Russia have received countervailable subsidies of 11.09% to 11.31%, 10%, 3.91% to 58.36%, and 0.62% to 6.95%, respectively.Some producers in Brazil were hit with 46.5% total duties while some producers in the U.K. will only receive 6.02% tariffs, which will continue to be collected by Customs and Border Protection upon import into the U.S. One producer in the Republic of Korea was hit with 64.62% total duties on cold-rolled imports.Brazil's Usiminas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais did not respond to all of Commerce's requests for information and, therefore, Commerce calculated a final dumping margin based on adverse facts available of 35.43% and levied 11.09% countervailing duties on the company for a total penalty of 46.52% tariffs.In the Korea anti-dumping investigation, Commerce found that dumping had occurred by mandatory respondents POSCO/Daewoo International Corporation and Hyundai Steel Corporation at dumping margins of 6.32% and 34.33%, respectively. Commerce calculated a final dumping margin of 20.33% for all other producers/exporters in Korea.What's interesting about this investigation is that while Commerce calculated a final subsidy rate of 3.91% for Hyundai Steel, the second mandatory respondent, POSCO, was unable to confirm certain key elements of its response when the Commerce team conducted verification at its headquarters in Korea. Therefore, Commerce calculated a subsidy rate based on adverse facts available of a whopping 58.3% meaning that POSCO gets a total anti-dumping/countervailing duties tariff of 64.62%. Commerce calculated a final subsidy rate of 3.91% for all other producers/exporters in Korea.Free Download: The July 2016 MMI ReportThe successful petitioners for these investigations were AK Steel Corporation, ArcelorMittal USA, Nucor Corporation, Steel Dynamics, Inc., and United States Steel Corporation.Your email address will not be published.
