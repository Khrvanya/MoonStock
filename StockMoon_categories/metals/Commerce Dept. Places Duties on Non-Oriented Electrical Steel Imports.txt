Commerce Dept. Places Duties on Non-Oriented Electrical Steel ImportsThe Dept. of Commerce has announced preliminary determinations that imports of non-oriented electrical steel (NOES) from China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Sweden and Taiwan are being sold at less than fair value in the US, commonly known as "dumping." NOES  is typically used in the production of large and small motors, generators, lighting ballasts, and ignition coils.FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering Steel/Iron Ore markets.As a result, Commerce will instruct US Customs and Border Protection to begin requiring U.S. importers of NOES from these six countries to deposit estimated antidumping duties at the time of importation.
