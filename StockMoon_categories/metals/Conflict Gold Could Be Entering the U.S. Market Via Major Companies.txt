Conflict Gold Could Be Entering the U.S. Market Via Major CompaniesWe've touched on conflict materials in this space before, typically in reference to cobalt. A majority of the world's cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where conditions at so-called artisanal mines (i.e., small-scale mines) are sub-standard, according to reports by a variety of NGOs.Among the concerns at these mines includes a lack of regulation, which in some cases leads to extremely unsafe working conditions and the use of child labor.Amnesty International last year released a report in which a number of big-name companies came in for criticism with respect to their cobalt supply chains.Need buying strategies for steel?

The study lists companies like Amazon, General Electric and Sony as possibly being ones that conflict gold may have been sold to.The Sentry's study can be found here.For more efficient carbon steel buying strategies, take a free trial of MetalMiner's Monthly Outlook!
