Construction MMI Can’t Gain Traction, Low Oil Prices Disrupt Energy ProjectsThe once-robust global construction market fell further this month as, here in the US, price-cutting by OPEC has caused large oil and gas projects to fall below their breakeven payback points.Free Download: Cut Your Construction Material Shipping CostsHeavy energy construction as fallen and the fragile single-family home market is not strong enough to pick up the slack.
The monthly Construction MMI(r) registered a value of 74 in April, a decrease of 1.3% from 75 in March.The effects of oil and gas drilling suspensions have been felt by producers of steel pipe used in the field (oil country tubular goods) and that lack of production showed up the past two months in the form of canceled or postponed exploration projects.Without the robust growth in civil drilling projects here in the US, construction spending fell in February as the numbers were also pulled down by a drop in single-family home building. Private spending on construction of single-family homes declined 1.4%.The pullback in exploration is, however, not just a US problem. A key "supply-based" response to low oil prices has been a sharp decline in rig counts and reductions in 2015 capital expenditure budgets from major oil companies, including ConocoPhillips, Chevron, Hess, and BP. These multinationals spend much of their exploration budgets 0n projects in the US but Brazil and other energy-rich nations could see projects canceled as wellThe "power" category of the US Census Bureau  -- which includes oil and gas facilities -- is down by 17.2% year-on-year and 4.5% for the month. That sector of the construction industry is simply going to have to wait until energy prices rise again.Our Free MetalMiner Newsletter(c)2020 MetalMiner  All rights reserved. | Media Kit | Cookie Consent Settings | privacy policy | terms of service
