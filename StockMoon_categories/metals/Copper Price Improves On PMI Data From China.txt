Copper Price Improves On PMI Data From ChinaData on China's manufacturing sector came out mixed yesterday, but still gave a small boost to the world's second-largest economy. Beijing's official purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 50.3 in March from 50.2 in February, in line with analyst expectations, but the nation's largest bank, HSBC, final reading came in at 48, a touch below last week's preliminary reading of 48.1. Copper is highly-dependent on the performance of the Chinese economy as so much of it is used as investment collateral by banks and other financial institutions in Shanghai's warehouse district.
