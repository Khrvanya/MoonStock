"For too long, the Government of China has been unfairly and illegally subsidizing its aluminum industry, leading to massive market overcapacity and challenging producers across the value chain.  Today's action by the Commerce Department is exactly the kind of strong, targeted trade enforcement we need in support of the rules-based global trading system."The DOC announced in November that it would self-initiate anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations of common alloy aluminum sheet imports from China (typically, cases are initiated after a domestic producer files a petition with the Department of Commerce). The move marked the first self-initiated investigation by the DOC in over 25 years.The DOC calculated preliminary antidumping margins of 167.16% of the value of the imported aluminum sheet.Want to see an Aluminum Price forecast?
