DiamondsSIR --Your article 'Changing facets' was very factual but I would like to point my opinion on the views of Alex Yearsley of Global Witness who states that blood diamonds make a tiny fraction of the world production. In my opinion 'blood diamonds' still comprise of a bigger market share as the market has become more deregulated with delisting of De Beers, the diamond cartel. The numerous small market players make it tough to trace back the origin of the diamond. Currently Africa, which contributes 60% of the world's diamond production is relatively quiet with no major conflicts but that doesn't necessarily mean that diamonds coming from these regions are not 'Blood Free' as people involved in diamond mining in Africa live in appalling conditions, have no minimum wage, and smuggling of these precious stones is rife.Akmal Mashood
