Dump Watch ITC Rules Against US GOES Producers; AK Steel, ATI Vow to AppealThe US International Trade Commission (USITC) today determined that the domestic Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel (GOES) industry is neither materially injured nor threatened with material injury by imports of GOES from China, the Czech Republic, Korea, and Russia that the US Department of Commerce determined are sold in the US at less than fair value and from China that Commerce has determined are subsidized.FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering Steel/Iron Ore markets.Chairman Meredith M. Broadbent, Vice Chairman Dean A. Pinkert, and Commissioners Irving A. Williamson, David S. Johanson, and F. Scott Kieff all negative, a vote that meant no tariffs or countervailing duties. Commissioner Rhonda K. Schmidtlein voted in the affirmative.As a result of the USITC's negative determinations, no anti-dumping duty or countervailing duty orders will be issued on imports of this product from China, the Czech Republic, Korea, and Russia."We are very disappointed by the negative determination by the ITC," said David A. Hartquist of Kelley Drye & Warren LLP, counsel to petitioners AK Steel and Allegheny Technologies, Inc. "We believe the case warranted an affirmative determination and that the majority decision contains fundamental errors of fact and law. The Department of Commerce found anti-dumping margins of up to 159%, which caused lost sales and significant financial injury to the US producers, which in our judgment met the legal standard for an affirmative determination. Therefore, the petitioners will appeal the decision to the US Court of International Trade."The petitioners also filed an appeal on September 16, 2014 of a similar ITC negative decision covering imports from Germany, Japan and Poland.
