European shares pause after record highs as virus fears grip(For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window) Feb 7 (Reuters) - European shares slipped slightly from all-time highs on Friday, as the rising death toll from the coronavirus outbreak and the pace of the spreading infection dulled sentiment. The pan-European stocks benchmark STOXX 600 fell 0.2% at 0805 GMT as the number of deaths from the flu-like virus climbed to 636 and confirmed cases of infection rose to 31,161 in China.

China-exposed sectors such as basic materials, luxury and auto stocks, which have seesawed over the past two weeks on virus fears, were the biggest decliners on the day.
