Federal Reserve Policies Clear as Mud Concerning Precious Metals’ FutureFederal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said yesterday that, while it will not increase the federal funds interest rate, the Fed could begin to raise interest rates whenever economic data indicates it can.FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering the Precious markets."The decisions that the committee makes regarding the appropriateness of the time to commence increasing its target for the federal funds rate will be data dependent," Yellen said. "Should the goals set by the Fed look to be accelerating in terms of being achieved earlier, then it is likely that the federal funds rate rise could be introduced earlier than expected."The Fed, as expected, said it would end its "quantitative easing" bond buying program next month. Many in the market wondered if it would then signal a relatively brisk move to raise interest rates from near zero, where they have been since 2008. It did not. The strengthening dollar has hurt investment metals such as silver and gold as their value as a hedge has been muted. While the end of QE will likely help the investment metals the interest rate picture remains murky at best.On Thursday, September 18, the day's biggest mover was US palladium bar, which saw a 1.2 percent decline to $830.00 per ounce.
