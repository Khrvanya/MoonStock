Finland's Outokumpu CEO Baan to leaveFeb 7 (Reuters) - Finnish stainless steel maker Outokumpu said on Friday that Roeland Baan, its CEO since 2016, would step down in May to become chief executive of a firm outside Finland. Outokumpu said the board expects to appoint a successor well ahead of Baan's departure. Outokumpu has reported falling sales and profits in recent quarters as cheap Asian imports hit its sales in Europe. (Reporting by Tarmo Virki; editing by Jason Neely)
