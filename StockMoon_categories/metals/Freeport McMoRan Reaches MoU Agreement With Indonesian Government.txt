Freeport McMoRan Reaches MoU Agreement With Indonesian GovernmentFreeport McMoran Copper has been involved in a stand-off with the Indonesian government over a tax on mineral exports since last year, Forbes reported. The Indonesian government had earlier banned unprocessed mineral exports from the country with effect from January 12. However, last minute changes to the law permitted both Freeport and Newmont Mining to export their copper concentrates, subject to new regulations, including an export tax. Both Freeport and Newmont had halted mineral exports from Indonesia as they did not have the necessary approvals under the new rules. Negotiations between the two companies and the Indonesian government have been ongoing for some time.FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering the Stainless/Nickel markets.
