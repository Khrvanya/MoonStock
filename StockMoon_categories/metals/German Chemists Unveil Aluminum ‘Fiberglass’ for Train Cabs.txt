German Chemists Unveil Aluminum ‘Fiberglass’ for Train CabsEngineers and materials scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology recently revealed a new aluminum foam for train cabs, a material that's stronger, lighter, and better in a crash than fiberglass or regular old metal.FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering the Aluminum market.Engineers in Chemitz, Germany unveiled a prototype high-speed train cab made with the stuff earlier this year, Wired reported. The composite material is built like a sandwich: Between two pieces of aluminum, each just two millimeters thick, is a 25-millimeter-thick layer of the "foam," actually a low-density, sponge-like composite of magnesium, silicon, and copper, and aluminum. And like a good sandwich, there's no glue. The layers are held together by metallic bonding, the electrostatic attraction of negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions.
