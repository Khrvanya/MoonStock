"The cobalt units will be shipped to Umicore's cobalt refineries globally, including the Kokkola refinery in Finland once the ongoing acquisition process is complete.""We are pleased to enter into this long-term partnership with Umicore in the fast growing electric vehicle market which further endorses Glencore's important role in supplying the materials that enable the energy and mobility transition," said Nico Paraskevas, head of marketing for Glencore's copper and cobalt division.Umicore's CEO touted the agreement as part of the firm's "growth strategy for cathode materials.""Our partnership with Glencore and the acquisition of the Kokkola refinery which has just been announced demonstrate our ability to execute our growth strategy for cathode materials with consistency," Umicore CEO Marc Grynberg said. "The agreement also reconfirms our strong commitment to promote a sustainable battery materials value chain globally. I am convinced that our battery cell and automotive customers will value our commitment to support their growth."Glencore released its first-quarter production figures in April, noting its Q1 2019 cobalt production of 10,900 tons marked a 56% year-over-year increase.Umicore, meanwhile, announced May 23 that it reached an agreement to acquire Freeport Cobalt's cobalt refining and cathode precursor activities in Kokkola, Finland -- the largest cobalt refinery in Europe -- "for a total consideration of $150 million on a debt and cash free basis, plus the value of the working capital to be taken over at closing, which at the end of March was approximately $40 million."MetalMiner's Annual Outlook provides 2019 buying strategies for carbon steelUmicore expects that deal to be finalized this year following regulatory approvals. The Kokkola facility will supply precursors for cathode material production in Nysa, Poland, which is expected to begin in 2020.Your email address will not be published.
