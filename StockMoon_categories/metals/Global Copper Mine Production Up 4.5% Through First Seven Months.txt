China was the main contributor to production growth in this category, while Chilean production rose 5%.On the other end of the spectrum, Indian production fell 22%. Production declines were also seen in Australia, the Philippines, Poland and the U.S. "as a consequence of maintenance shutdowns and operational issues."The refined copper balance through the first seven months of the year shows a deficit of 155,000 tons, according to the report.For more efficient carbon steel buying strategies, take a free trial of MetalMiner's Monthly Outlook!Even so, the copper price has traded sideways as of late, on the heels of a 7.8% surge in the LME copper price between Sept. 17 and Sept. 24 (reaching $6,318/t as of Sept. 24).Source: LMEAccording to the report, the average LME cash price for September was $6,020.03/t, marking a 0.3% decline from the August average of $6,039.75/t.Your email address will not be published.
