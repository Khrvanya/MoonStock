Elsewhere, demand is expected to rise in Europe by 1.6% this year and 1.0% in 2019. It's also projected to rise in India, and remain stable in Japan and South Korea.On the supply side, zinc mine production is projected to rise 2% in 2018 and 6.4% in 2019.The global zinc market is projected to be in deficit both this year and next. According to the report, demand will exceed supply by 322kt in 2018, and by 72kt in 2019.Lead demand growth is on the more modest size, projected to hit 0.2% in 2018 and 0.7% in 2019.China's lead usage is projected to fall this year and next."In 2018, Chinese apparent usage is expected to fall by 0.6% influenced by a combination of reductions in the motorcycle and e-bike sectors as consequence of increased penetration by lithium-ion batteries and a slower growth in the automotive sector," the ILZSG report states. "Increases in the e-trike production are not expected to be sufficient to offset this declining trend. A further 1.3% fall in apparent usage in China is anticipated in 2019."European lead usage is forecast to rise 1.4% and 1.8% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Meanwhile, U.S. usage is forecast to decline this year by 0.6% and rise 2.5% in 2019.For more efficient carbon steel buying strategies, take a free trial of MetalMiner's Monthly Outlook!On the supply side, global lead mine supply is forecast to fall by 0.4% this year and rise by 4.1% in 2019.HOW CAN I BE PART OF LEAD AND ZINC EXPORT.AS I CAN SUPPLY A COMMERCIAL QUANTITY
