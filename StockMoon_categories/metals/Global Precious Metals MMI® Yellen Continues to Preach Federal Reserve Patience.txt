Lock in Trade Prices Before Your Cargo Leaves the PortChairwoman Janet Yellen continued to preach Federal Reserve patience today, saying that the US economy is making steady progress, but the Fed remains patient in raising interest rates because too many Americans are still unemployed, wage growth remains sluggish and inflation is too low.In her semiannual economic report to Congress, Yellen sought to explain how the Fed would begin raising rates from lows near zero. Its continuing use of the word "patient" means a rate hike is unlikely for at least the next two meetings, she said. More price inflation could, of course, lead to more consumption of gold and silver as hedges against it but Yellen's comments have not yet had that effect on the investment metals.The week's biggest mover on the weekly Global Precious Metals MMI(r) was the price of Japanese silver, which saw a 8.8% decline to JPY 600.00 ($5.04) per 10 grams.
