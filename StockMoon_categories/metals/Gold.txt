GoldWorld gold production fell by 1% in 2007, according to the latest Gold Survey from GFMS. Gold prices have risen to new highs this year, but fresh supply has been held back by a global shortage of mining professionals and equipment. China, where gold output rose by 12% last year, supplanted South Africa as the world's number-one producer--a position it had held for more than a century. South Africa's production fell by 8%, partly in response to tougher safety controls. Australia leapfrogged America, where output fell by 5%, to claim third place in the rankings. Peru's output fell below Russia's, after tumbling by 17% last year. Supply from Indonesia, Ghana, Brazil and Mexico increased rapidly.
