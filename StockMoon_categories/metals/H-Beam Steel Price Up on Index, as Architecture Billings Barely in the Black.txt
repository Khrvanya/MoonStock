H-Beam Steel Price Up on Index, as Architecture Billings Barely in the BlackAfter its first negative score in 10 months, the Architecture Billings Index (ABI) showed a small increase in design activity in February, and has been positive 10 out of the past 12 months.Free Download: The Latest Metal Price Trends in the March MMI ReportAs an economic indicator of construction activity, the ABI reflects a 9-to-12-month lead time between architecture billings and construction spending. The American Institute of Architects (AIA) reported the February ABI score was 50.4, up slightly from a mark of 49.9 in January. This score reflects a minor increase in design services (any score above 50 indicates an increase in billings).Questions about the uneven recovery in both residential and commercial construction are keeping the US architectural design market from growing more than the slight increases and small decrease of recent months."The health of the institutional market has been the key factor for positive business conditions for the design and construction industry in recent months, and it is encouraging to see that sector remain on solid footing," said AIA Chief Economist Kermit Baker, Hon. AIA, PhD. "However, we're seeing some slowing in the other major construction sectors. Design billings for residential projects had its first negative month in more than three years, and commercial design billings have seen only modest growth in recent years."A sector that's not covered by the ABI, infrastructure spending, is experiencing growing pains, as well. Many economists are projecting that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this summer, which could increase borrowing costs and potentially affect infrastructure construction, according to US News and World Report. Several economists say that infrastructure spending is badly needed and that Congress should look at alternative ways to fund construction, including raising the gas tax and increasing public-private partnerships.Residential and commercial construction could see a lack of available credit, as well, if the Fed signals that interest rates could rise sooner rather than later.For exact week-over-week price trends in metals used in the construction industry, click below!Our Free MetalMiner Newsletter(c)2020 MetalMiner  All rights reserved. | Media Kit | Cookie Consent Settings | privacy policy | terms of service
