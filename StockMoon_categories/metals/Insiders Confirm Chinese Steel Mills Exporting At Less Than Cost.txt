Insiders Confirm Chinese Steel Mills Exporting At Less Than CostSources told Reuters that steelmakers in China were selling their products below cost and President Obama hosted a picnic at the White House with members of Congress ahead of a key trade vote.Some Chinese steelmakers are selling their products abroad at a loss, traders and a producer told Reuters, as a group of global industry bodies urged governments to take action over rising shipments from China.Free Download: Latest Metal Price Trends in the June MMI ReportChinese mills had sold steel overseas at a loss of up to 200 CNY ($32) a metric ton and cut the export price of hot-rolled coil by 5% to $340-$350 per mt, free-on-board basis, this week compared to last week, traders and a producer in Hebei, China's top steel-producing province told the news service.These mills were also selling at a loss to the domestic market, the sources said."The domestic market is too weak to consume high output and our prices are competitive, so some mills are still keen to step up exports, hoping to ease high inventories and maintain market share," said a senior official at a privately owned mill in Hebei.President Obama hosted members of Congress at the White House for a congressional picnic amid a fierce trade debate on Capitol Hill.This year's gathering took place before the House was expected to hold a vote to revive the president's stalled trade agenda, and less than one week after Democrats killed a key part of the legislative package.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was in attendance at the picnic. The president has not spoken with her personally since she led the Democratic revolt against the trade bills.The event is seen as an opportunity for the president to get face time with lawmakers in a low-pressure setting. That could prove to be important for Obama with the House set for a re-vote on fast-track trade authority and a measure to provide aid to US workers displaced by international trade.Free Webinar: Are You Speculating When You Buy Spot Metals?Your email address will not be published.
