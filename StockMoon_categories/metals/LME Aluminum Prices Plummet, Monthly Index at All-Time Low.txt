LME Aluminum Prices Plummet, Monthly Index at All-Time LowOur aluminum price index registered a value of 89 in February, a decrease of 3.3 percent from 92 in January.The 3-month LME price closed on Tuesday at $1,686 per metric ton, the lowest level seen in the past 4+ years. Aluminum keeps struggling to reach previous peaks, but it doesn't seem to have any problem with reaching new lows - a perfect definition of a downtrend.We have been calling for lower aluminum prices in one of our recent MMI reports and this latest downward movement makes us even more bearish. Some have been arguing that prices were low and they couldn't go even lower. We don't share that opinion, and while the trend is in motion, we expect prices to keep going down.
