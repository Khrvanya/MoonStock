Liberia's economyAnxiously looking eastIRON ORE has played a big part in Liberia's economic resuscitation since it emerged from civil war a decade ago, but there could be trouble ahead. Leaders in the tiny west African state are concerned about falling demand from China, the main customer for its prime commodity export. "We are worried," admits finance minister Amara Konneh. "The declining demand for iron ore from China, as well as the falling price, are factors that are beyond our control."Iron ore prices have fallen 11% in the past month and are now at their lowest since 2012. China has been almost single-handedly responsible for the doubling of demand for iron ore since 2000, and its imports are still increasing. However, analysts expect that to change over the coming years. China announced financing curbs for ore imports in April.Foreign investors have pumped billions of dollars into iron ore projects since peace was restored in Liberia, and revived production has spurred economic growth in recent years. But reliance on demand from a single foreign economy is a worry. Falling prices have caught Liberia off guard. Few jobs have been created during eleven years of peace, nor has the country diversified away from resources. Iron ore now represents about 25% of GDP. If China's market slows, Liberia will be left scrabbling for revenue elsewhere.
