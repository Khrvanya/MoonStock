METALS-Base metals rise as stronger global equities aid sentimentMarch 5 (Reuters) - Industrial metals rose on Thursday as sentiment received a boost from stronger equity markets, outweighing worries about the global economic impact from the fast-spreading coronavirus. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) rose 0.7% to $5,725 a tonne by 0310 GMT, while the most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) advanced 0.2% to 45,170 yuan ($6,510.99) a tonne. Asian shares rallied for a fourth straight session as U.S. markets swung sharply higher and another dose of central bank stimulus offered some salve for the global economic outlook. Wall Street seemed to find relief in the strong performance of former Vice President Joe Biden in the Democratic nomination campaign. Biden is considered less likely to raise taxes and impose new regulations than rival Bernie Sanders. * PRICES: LME aluminium rose 0.1% to $1,727.50 a tonne, nickel advanced 1% to $12,805 a tonne, zinc jumped 1.2% to $2,005.50 a tonne.
