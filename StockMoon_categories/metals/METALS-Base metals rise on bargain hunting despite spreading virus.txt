METALS-Base metals rise on bargain hunting despite spreading virus(Updates prices) By Mai Nguyen Feb 25 (Reuters) - London industrial metals prices rose on Tuesday, recovering slightly after dropping in the previous session, but gains were capped as the coronavirus continued to spread quickly outside China.
