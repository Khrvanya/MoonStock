METALS-Copper falls on fears of coronavirus spread and strong dollar* Zinc hits lowest since July 2016 as supply grows * Copper gives up early gains to slip for third session * Lead flipped into surplus in December (Updates with closing prices, adds nickel balance data) By Eric Onstad LONDON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Copper prices slipped on Thursday, weakened by fears that the coronavirus outbreak in China could spread globally and further dampen economic growth and metals demand. Scores of new coronavirus cases and a first death in South Korea fanned fears of global pandemic as research suggested it could be more contagious than previously thought. Copper was given an early fillip from an interest rate cut in top metals consumer China but later fell back into negative territory for a third session running, also weighed down by a stronger dollar. "We've seen a lot of support coming from China's central bank and government, but there's worry about (the virus) spreading to other countries," said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen. "Adding to this, we've seen the dollar move higher and a strong dollar in a world so loaded up on debt is a very bad cocktail for growth and demand." Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) fell 0.8% to $5,727 a tonne in final open-outcry trading after rising as much as 0.8% to $5,814. Copper has repeatedly failed to break through resistance around $5,800. * DOLLAR: The dollar index hit its highest since May 2017 and is now up more than 3.5% this year. The Japanese yen, meanwhile, slipped to its weakest in 10 months. A stronger dollar makes commodities priced in the U.S. currency more expensive to buyers using other currencies. * ALUMINIUM OUTPUT: Global primary aluminium output rose to 5.451 million tonnes in January from a revised figure of 5.439 million tonnes in December, data showed. LME aluminium shed 0.5% to close at $1,711 a tonne. * NICKEL BALANCE: The global nickel market widened its surplus to 2,000 tonnes in December from a surplus of 1,100 tonnes in the previous month, data showed. * ZINC TC:  A Japanese zinc smelter has agreed zinc concentrate treatment charges (TCs) of $300 a tonne for 2020 with a Western mining company, Chinese research house Antaike said. That is up from a 2019 benchmark of about $245 a tonne. * ZINC SPREAD: The discount of LME cash ZINC over the three-month contract CMZN0-3 rose to $16 a tonne, the highest since September 2018 and compared with a premium of $23.75 a month ago. This indicates healthy supplies of zinc in the LME system. * PRICES: LME zinc fell 0.8% to finish at $2,112 a tonne, its lowest level since July 2016. Nickel dropped 1.2% to finish at $12,670 and tin rose 0.3% to $16,575. Lead, untraded in closing rings, was bid down 0.9% at $1,867. * For top stories in metals and other news, click or (Reporting by Eric Onstad Editing by David Goodman and David Evans)
