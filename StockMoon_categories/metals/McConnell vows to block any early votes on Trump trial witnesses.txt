McConnell vows to block any early votes on Trump trial witnessesWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that he would move to set aside any efforts by Democrats to force an early vote on subpoenaing witnesses and documents during afternoon proceedings in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial.   "If any amendments are brought forward to force premature opinions on mid-trial questions, I will move to table such amendments," McConnell said in floor remarks, noting that his proposed trial resolution would postpone decisions on evidence until days into the proceedings.   "If a senator moves to amend the resolution in order to subpoena specific witnesses or documents, I will move to table such motions because the Senate will decide those questions later in the trial," he added.
