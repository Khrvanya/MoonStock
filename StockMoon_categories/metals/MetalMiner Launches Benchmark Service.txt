MetalMiner Launches Benchmark ServiceWe recently launched a new product, MetalMiner Benchmark, which is a secure, anonymous and reliable way for you, the buyer, to compare industrial metal prices (or quotes) from North American Suppliers to thousands of transactions made by other firms for the same or similar metals.The MetalMiner(sm) Benchmark application is different than other pricing tools. The MMB database contains prices actually paid or quoted, NOT catalog prices. While there are plenty of "transactional polling sites" out there, most of them simply scrape and compile publicly available information. The MMB database contains millions of specific price points allowing for detailed analysis of your metal spend by type, grade, form, and size (e.g. 3003 H14 .050 x 48" x 120" sheets). The goal is simple: promote price transparency in the marketplace and help you source the materials you need more effectively.Your email address will not be published.
