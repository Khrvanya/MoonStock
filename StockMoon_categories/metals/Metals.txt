MetalsThe boom in metals prices may be petering out. Precious metals fell sharply this week, as lower oil prices and the resurgent dollar lessened the appeal of hedges against inflation. The gold price tumbled by 4.5% in one day, to its lowest level this year. It has dropped by 19% from its peak in March. Platinum prices have fallen by 34% since then. Base-metal prices have also lost ground: our dollar-based index has fallen by 21% since March. The global economic slowdown has dented demand for raw materials. Nickel prices have sunk to their lowest for two years. Copper prices are down too, partly because demand from China, the world's biggest consumer, is flat. But world copper stocks are depleted, so prices may yet perk up again.
