This was an 11% increase over the Q4 2014 production of 1,328 mt.Molycorp reported Q1 2015 product sales volume of 3,436 mt on a consolidated basis, a 9% increase over the Q4 2014.

Molycorp reiterated that it would need more financing to continue operations.The problem for Molycorp is much the same as that for the entire rare earths industry: low prices. China ending export quotas on the elements has not yet resulted in higher prices and companies such as Molycorp, Texas Rare Earth Resources and Australia's Lynas Corp. are feeling the pinch as a result. Many high-tech buyers of the magnets and oxides in the rare earths ground have moved on to other sources.Our Free MetalMiner Newsletter(c)2020 MetalMiner  All rights reserved. | Media Kit | Cookie Consent Settings | privacy policy | terms of service
