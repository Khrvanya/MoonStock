Monthly Stainless MMI® Falls as Nickel Prices Find a FloorAfter nickel prices fell sharply in September, nickel finally bounced back up last month as prices were oversold. We commented on this in our last report when we pointed out: "Nickel fell again in October, but the drop wasn't as significant as September's and recent price movements are telling us that prices might be finding a floor."Nickel on the LME is up by 6% since the beginning of November while commodities keep falling sharply. (Meanwhile, stainless forms and surcharges on our Stainless MMI(r) have indeed declined.) Fundamentals are set to tighten and, in theory, this should fuel buying interest eventually. The question is: are nickel fundamentals strong enough to significantly push the metal up in 2015 while investors stay away from commodities?
