New Iron-Aluminum Alloy is as Strong as Titanium, POSCO Starting TrialsA team from Pohang University of Science and Technology, South Korea, have manipulated the structure of an iron-aluminum alloy to create a new kind of material that could find application in everything from bicycles to airplanes. South Korean steel giant POSCO is even starting trials of the new alloy.FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering the Aluminum market.Steel is renowned for its strength and low price, but is very heavy. To make use of it in scenarios that demand light weight-- without resorting to buying titanium--material scientists often alloy it with aluminum, which is light and also mercifully cheap. The mixture of aluminum and steel also usually includes a sprinkling of manganese to make it less brittle, but even then, the material is still usually too brittle for use in vehicles.
