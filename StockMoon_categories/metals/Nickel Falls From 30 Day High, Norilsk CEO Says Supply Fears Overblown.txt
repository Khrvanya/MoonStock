Nickel Falls From 30 Day High, Norilsk CEO Says Supply Fears OverblownVladimir Potanin, the billionaire who runs Russia's Norilsk Nickel, told Bloomberg News that concerns that supplies of the metal will be disrupted by sanctions against the country over the crisis in Ukraine are overstated and that nickel supplies would be augmented by finished producy from Indonesia in the next two years.
