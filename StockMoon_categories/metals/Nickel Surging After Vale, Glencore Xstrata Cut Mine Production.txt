Nickel Surging After Vale, Glencore Xstrata Cut Mine ProductionThe price of nickel jumped 6 percent today as the alloying metal in stainless steel remained volatile. The Financial Times reported that supply concerns for nickel were exacerbated when Vale suspended work at its Goro operation on the Pacific archipelago of New Caledonia due to a spill. The mine had been expected to produce about 40,000 tons of nickel this year, out of a total worldwide production of about 2 million tons. Earlier this week Glencore Xtrata said output at its Koniambo mine, also in New Caledonia, had been disappointing, and that its 26,000-ton production forecast for this year was being reviewed.
