Nickel’s Big LME Drop Continued On Friday, Down 10%The day's biggest mover on the London Metal Exchange Friday was the 3-month price of nickel which dropped by 10.1 percent to close at $18,600 per metric ton. The nickel spot price dropped to $18,745 per metric ton on the LME after a 9.2 percent decrease. Nickel has been regaining some of its lost ground today and it has still surged over 50 percent this year to touch a 27-month peak of $21,625 last Tuesday. As Indonesia's nickel ore export ban continues there is good reason to believe that nickel will be back to its customary daily gains soon.FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering the Stainless/Nickel markets.
