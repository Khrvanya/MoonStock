Those shareholders will also buy 47.7 million shares from Public Investment Corp., South Africa's largest fund manager, for 2 billion rand. That will bring the holdings to 35.4%, Bloomberg News reported.The company will use "the injection of 4 billion rand free cash to fund Northam's growth," it said in a statement. "The transaction effectively catapults Northam into the '1st division,'" Northam said, referring to the largest producers including Anglo American Platinum Ltd.
