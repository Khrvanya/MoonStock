Oh boy, AmericaLET me add a few more comments to my colleague's post on the Buy America provision. There are two criticisms of the provision that are generally made by economists. One is that it's bad economics. The other is that it's bad politics. Paul Krugman, for instance, argues here that the policy might be decent economics, but bad geopolitics. Nick Rowe, by contrast, argues that it's bad economics, too (though Mr Krugman responds by saying that no, not necessarily). Doug Irwin offers a little of both arguments, and Brad DeLong writes what is probably my favourite comment on the provision:Mr Krugman says that the total dissolution of the trading system (which hasn't happened, yet--volumes are down, but the rules of the system remain in place) isn't likely. Maybe so, but given the cost of such a collapse, we should remain quite vigilant. It's also odd to me to see the reactions of many economists on the left to this provision. They have demanded that we heed the lessons of history when it comes to fiscal and monetary policy in the context of depression, and yet they seemingly gloss over the trade and political problems of the 1930s as unimportant. And writers on the left who excoriated president Bush for his rough treatment of foreign countries and international institutions seem decidedly uninterested in defending internationalism and the rule of law where trade is concerned. Colour me highly disappointed at the asymmetry.
