PRECIOUS-Gold steady as markets gauge virus impact, await Fed decisionJan 29 (Reuters) - Gold prices were little changed on Wednesday after sliding 1% in the previous session, as investors took stock of the economic impact of the new coronavirus and awaited the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. * Spot gold remained steady at $1,565.69 per ounce by 0134 GMT.
