Palladium a Key Ingredient in New Biofuel Stability MixScientists have combined iron and palladium to form a new catalyst for converting biomass into fuels fit for today's gas tanks. It's part of an effort to make biofuels more energy dense, and therefore more competitive with fossil fuels, the Christian Science Monitor reported.FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering the Precious markets.Have you ever found that when using ethanol or another bio-fuel that your tank runs dry faster because it burns faster than gasoline? That's because their source, biomass, contains a fair amount of oxygen. That makes them less stable, too viscous and less efficient than the fuels they're meant to replace.
