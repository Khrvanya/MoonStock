Rare Earths JVs to Have Tough Time Making Money, as Oxide Prices Gain This WeekWhile three rare earth oxide prices increased on MetalMiner's weekly Rare Earths MMI(r), the outlook for prices is a rather downcast one. Why? It all comes down to more production and ensuing supply. We said last month in our Monthly MMI(r)  Report that the WTO case that ruled against China is likely to bring down prices a bit over the medium to long term by some reasonable margin, but there have been rumors of a national Chinese stockpile of rare earth oxides, especially the heavy RE oxides - a more impactful factor for the moment, according to Zachary Schumacher, rare earths analyst at Asian Metal. Of course, there are other JVs out there that all want a piece of the action, which may not help their bottom lines - but falling prices could help rare earths buyers.
