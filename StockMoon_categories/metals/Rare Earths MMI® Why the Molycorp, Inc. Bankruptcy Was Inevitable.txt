In a statement, Molycorp President and CEO Geoff Bedford said, "The actions we have taken today are important steps toward achieving a restructuring of our $1.7 billion debt with our major creditor constituencies. In doing so, the company expects to exit Chapter 11 with an appropriate financing framework to support our business going forward."We have documented the long stock price slide Molycorp has experienced and how many manufacturers have simply found substitutions for the light rare earths they offer.
