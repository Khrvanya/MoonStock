Rare Earths Suffer From Substitution Due to BoomBust Price CyclesRare earths are hitting new price lows as major manufacturers continue to invest in new technologies to substitute them out due to price volatility. Iron ore is still oversupplied, but stockpiles are falling faster than expected.Reuters' Andy Home recently wrote about how large manufacturers are finding substitutions for heavy rare earths in a gambit to avoid the boom and bust price cycles of the magnet and battery metals that previously disrupted their supply chains.Two-Month Trial: Metal Buying OutlookJapanese automotive giant Honda and its technology partner Daido Steel recently announced a materials breakthrough in the electric motors used in hybrid vehicles. Starting with the next generation of "FREED" minivan due to go on sale later this year, Honda will be using a motor that doesn't need heavy rare earth metals.Specifically, it will be the world's first hybrid engine, a gasoline and electric motor, to dispense with terbium and dysprosium."Major deposits of heavy rare earth elements are unevenly (distributed) around the world (...) thus, the use of heavy rare earth carries risks from the perspectives of stable procurement and material costs," Honda said in a statement.Free Download: The July 2016 MMI ReportA fairly innocuous sounding statement but one that cuts to the heart of the roller coaster history of the rare earths market.Iron ore's wild price gyrations this year may be masking a small, but significant, shift in the underlying fundamentals for the steel-making ingredient. While seaborne iron ore remains a well-supplied market, it appears the level of over-supply has been diminishing faster than many expected, leading to an improvement in the supply-demand balance, Reuters' Clyde Russell writes.Your email address will not be published.
