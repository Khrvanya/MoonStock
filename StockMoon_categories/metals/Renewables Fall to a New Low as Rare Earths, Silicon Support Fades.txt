Renewables Fall to a New Low as Rare Earths, Silicon Support FadesThe renewables market lost ground again this month, going from being an unspectacular but steady market to just an unspectacular one. It's even now from the range it had been hovering in since last November.The monthly Renewables MMI(r) registered a value of 58 in June, a decrease of 3.3% from 60 in May.Free Download: MetalMiner's Top Service Centers GuideWhat's concerning is that while we certainly didn't expect renewables to break out and hit new highs this year, they've actually lost significant ground compared to late 2014 when the range hovered between 60 and 70. 58 is a new all-time low.  We can only chalk this drop up to more incentives for end-use products using silicon in the solar market and the overall weakness in the rare earths market for neodymium.In California this month, a state cap-and-trade program is now giving away crystalline silicon photovoltaic panels to low-income homeowners. While this will certainly help adoption, it won't do any favors to companies such as SolarWorld, Inc. which are trying to bring prices of the panels, and silicon itself, up to achieve higher profit margins.Silicon will also inevitably feel the pinch from a wave of mergers in the semiconductor industry that will force the involved companies to adopt better procurement and lean operations principles.The more interesting renewable market is that of grain-oriented electrical steel. While the US GOES price actually went up this month, the GOES M3 price, a much better indicator of actual purchasing activity, went down.
