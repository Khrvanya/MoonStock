Rusal Aluminum Prices Will Recover, Still Cutting OutputAluminum producer UC Rusal PLC said Monday it expects prices to recover in the second half of 2014 after a year of struggling with declines that led to production cutbacks, the Wall Street Journal reported. The Russian company, which is the world's largest aluminum producer, slashed production by 8% to 3.9 million metric tons in 2013 and halted production at several smelters after it had called for industrywide cuts in an effort to reduce stockpiles around the world. Rusal said it expects to continue reducing output this year to 3.5 million tons. FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering the Aluminum market.
