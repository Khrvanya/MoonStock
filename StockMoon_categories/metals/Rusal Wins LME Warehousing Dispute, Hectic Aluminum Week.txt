Rusal Wins LME Warehousing Dispute, Hectic Aluminum WeekAluminum markets were roiled this week as The London Metal Exchange was forced put on hold new rules to tackle the long warehouse queues that aluminum buyers blame for increasing the price of their products. The new rules were due to take effect at the start of April, but were thrown into disarray Wednesday when a UK court said the consultation procedure was "unfair and unlawful," and set the rules aside. UC Rusal, the world's largest aluminum smelter/producer, filed the lawsuit against the LME.
