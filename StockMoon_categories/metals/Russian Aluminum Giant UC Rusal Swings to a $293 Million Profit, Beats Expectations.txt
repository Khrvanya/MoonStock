Russian Aluminum Giant UC Rusal Swings to a $293 Million Profit, Beats ExpectationsAluminum producer UC Rusal PLC said Wednesday it swung to a net profit last year thanks to a recovery in the metal's price and a slide in the ruble's value that helped boost its profit margins.Free Download: Automate International Trade DealsThe Russian aluminum giant, which is listed in Hong Kong, said its net profit for 2014 was $293 million, a sharp recovery from a net loss of $3.32 billion in 2013. Rusal's improved earnings came despite a 4.1% fall in revenue and a 6.6% drop in its aluminum output to 256,000 tons last year. That beat even the most positive expectations.The company said "stringent" cost control and its decision to shut down inefficient smelters helped it return to profitability. Rusal's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization surged to $1.5 billion compared with $870 million in 2013. Chief Executive Vladislav Soloviev told the Wall Street Journal the company "has no plans to restart any mothballed aluminum capacity."Our Free MetalMiner Newsletter(c)2020 MetalMiner  All rights reserved. | Media Kit | Cookie Consent Settings | privacy policy | terms of service
