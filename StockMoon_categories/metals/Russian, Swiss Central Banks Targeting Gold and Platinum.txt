Russian, Swiss Central Banks Targeting Gold and PlatinumThe central banks of Russia and Switzerland are weighing the merits of buying gold and other precious metals, but for very different reasons, Bullion Vault reported.FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering the Precious markets.Now holding the world's 5th largest state gold reserves, Russian central bank chiefs plan to meet with officials from South Africa - the world's No.1 platinum mining nation - to discuss buying platinum and palladium in the open market to support prices, according to a Kremlin official.Moscow's precious metals and gems repository, Gokhran, already holds unreported quantities of palladium, of which Russia is the No.1 mine producer. Gokhran's director, Andrey Yurin, last month repeated comments he made in May about returning to buy palladium in 2015, after focusing on buying gold this year.The Swiss National Bank faces a popular vote on buying gold - aimed at reinstating the Franc's bullion backing - but many are campaigning against the move.Voters in Switzerland in 1999 approved an end to the legal requirement for gold reserves to back the Franc's value, and approved large sales starting at what proved t2wo-decade lows, now some 70% below current prices.To win a place on Switzerland's next referendum, scheduled for November 30, the "Save Our Swis Gold" initiative secured over 100,000 signatures on a petition. Its proposals risk the central bank's ability to ensure price stability and stable economic growth, finance minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said Tuesday. Peter Hegglin - head of the Swiss cantons' conference of finance directors - also joined SNB president Thomas Jordan's repeated calls for voters to reject the move.Chinese platinum bar saw a 1.5% drop on Friday, October 10, landing at CNY 266.00 ($43.31) per gram and making it the biggest mover of the day.
