Ryanair says talks with Boeing on 737 MAX compensation going wellDUBLIN, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Ryanair on Monday said talks with Boeing on compensation for the delayed delivery of the grounded 737 MAX jet were going well, but that they could not be finalised until the jet is flying again. "They are going well," O'Leary said in video presentation. "We are having discussions with Boeing both on the pricing of those aircraft and also on Boeing reimbursing Ryanair our costs and losses for these delayed deliveries." "But they can't really be finalised until we have a revised delivery schedule that is real and credible because the aircraft are back flying," O'Leary added.
