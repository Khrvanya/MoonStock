Schumer accuses McConnell of wanting to use Senate for 'cover-up'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate's top Democrat Chuck Schumer on Tuesday accused Mitch McConnell, the Senate's top Republican, of wanting to use the institution to help participate in a "cover-up" as the Senate prepares for a likely impeachment trial against U.S. President Donald Trump. "It's clear that Senator McConnell wants to use the Senate to help participate in a cover-up," Schumer told reporters. Schumer requested the testimony of four current and former White House officials, but McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has opposed this demand.
