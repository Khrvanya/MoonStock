Silver Turns Around, Perhaps Thanks to Increasing Solar DemandOne of the factors harming silver's slipping industrial demand has been the decline of the use of physical film in both the photography and film industries. Digital projection has replaced most movie theater film projection and movie film was coated with a thin layer of silver chloride, silver bromide or silver iodide. Movie screens were covered in paint embedded with the reflective white metal, which is how the term "silver screen" came to be.FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering the Precious markets.Forbes reports that since 1999, photography has increasingly gone digital, and as a result, silver demand in the film industry has contracted about 70%. Picking up the slack in volume, however, is a technology that also requires silver: crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) installation, otherwise known as solar energy. Silver demand in the fabrication of solar panels is set to outpace photography, if it hasn't already done so.Every solar panel contains between 15 and 20 grams of silver. At today's prices, that's about $20 per panel. When silver was hanging out in the mid-$30s range a couple of years ago, it was double that.
