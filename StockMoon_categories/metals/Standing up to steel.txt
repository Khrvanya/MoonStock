Standing up to steelUNTIL now, the steel industry has been remarkably successful in its campaign for Congress and the administration to "stand up for steel" against a surge of imports from Japan and elsewhere. But on June 22nd, the Senate voted to stand up to the steel lobby instead. It effectively killed a bill which had previously sailed through the House, imposing quotas on all foreign steel producers.The White House sighed with relief. It had signalled that it would veto the bill, had the Senate approved it, because it violates world-trade law, invites other countries to hit back against American exports, and would have cost steel-using industries dear. But a presidential veto would have triggered a showdown with the powerful and media-savvy steelworkers that could have damaged Vice-President Al Gore's presidential hopes. The steel industry is not too unhappy, however. It has already won plenty of goodies. Steel imports from Japan have plunged (see chart). The administration has imposed prohibitive duties on steel imports from Japan and Brazil. Japan and Russia have agreed "voluntarily" to limit their steel exports to America. The industry has also launched a further 20 anti-dumping and ten anti-subsidy cases against 18 countries. Most of these are likely to result in whopping import duties.President Clinton has offered the industry a subsidy package that includes $300m in tax breaks. The Senate is considering a bill providing a further $1 billion of loan guarantees--effectively subsidies--to wobbly steel and energy companies. Worst of all, the administration is open to reforming trade-remedy laws to make it easier and quicker for firms to get temporary protection from import surges. That would open the door for other industries to follow steel down the protectionist path. In short, although the steel industry has lost the quota battle, it still looks likely to win the war.
