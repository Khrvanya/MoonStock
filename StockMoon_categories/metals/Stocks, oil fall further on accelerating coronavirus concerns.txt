Stocks, oil fall further on accelerating coronavirus concernsNEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks across the globe fell on Tuesday to their lowest since early December and the benchmark U.S. debt yield hit a record low on concerns about the economic hit of the spread of the novel coronavirus.

It depends how long it goes an how wide the spread," he adding, advising that investors wait for at least two days of gains before buying stocks again.
