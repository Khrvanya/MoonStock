This Morning in Metals EU Aluminum Smelting Costs Going Up, China Squeezes U.S. ScrapThis morning in metals, we look at a few key stories circulating in the metals news mill that buyers should have an eye on.According to CRU Group (paywall), the free carbon permit allowances for EU aluminum smelters that have always been in place are about to be reduced.And that amounts to a cost hike.Due to the reforms of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) for the years 2021-2030, we can expect higher carbon prices and rising aluminum smelting costs. Buyers take note: this "will raise smelting costs for the average smelter by $10-$25/ton of aluminum, depending on the final EU policy decision," according to CRU. "The increasing permit price will also drive indirect carbon costs higher, but the effect varies greatly from smelter to smelter," according to the firm.The Wall Street Journal reports that "prices for mixed aluminum scrap dropped by about 15% over the past month, crumbling profit margins for processors and brokers that sell the material to China," according today's WSJ supply chain and and logistics newsletter."Analysts say Chinese companies may end up buying more scrap aluminum from cheaper sources in Europe. In the U.S., some worry that trash collectors may simply toss recyclables in landfills if they can't find other buyers," writes Jennifer Smith.
