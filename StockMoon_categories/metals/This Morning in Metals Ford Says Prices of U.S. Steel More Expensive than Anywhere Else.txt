Request your two-month free trial of MetalMiner's OutlookHigh PricesU.S. automaker Ford has been vocal about what it views as the negative impact of the U.S.'s steel and aluminum tariffs.According to a Detroit News report, Ford's president of global operations on Monday said "U.S. steel is costing more than anywhere else in the world" as a result of the tariffs.MetalMiner's Take: It's a bit difficult to understand what has driven the public complaints from Ford about steel and aluminum tariffs, particularly when most OEMs take long positions on their metal spend.Some OEMs have locked-in contract prices that simply do not fluctuate, according to MetalMiner benchmark data. The manufacturing organizations that make stronger arguments against tariffs are those that remain subject to spot-price movements, have a corporate policy that forbids hedging or lack the buying power to demand fixed prices.Perhaps the vocalization of the complaints have heated up because many OEMs have entered the fourth quarter contract negotiation season and the producers want to open discussions at much higher price levels. In defense of Ford's complaints, the multi-tier extended supply chain remains far more exposed to metal price volatility than a company like Ford.In this environment, OEMs will need to work double time to create programs and opportunities for aggregating volumes across supply chains, developing directed buy and enablement programs, aggregation opportunities and using technology to better support the entire extended global supply chain.China's Alumina Exports Rise in SeptemberChina's exports of alumina hit a 2018 high in September, Reuters reported.Exports of alumina in September hit 165,839 tons, up from 29,722 tons in August.LME Copper FallsThe LME copper price fell 1.1% on Tuesday, Reuters reported.MetalMiner's Annual Outlook provides 2019 buying strategies for carbon steelThe drop comes a day after London copper had reached a one-week high.Your email address will not be published.
