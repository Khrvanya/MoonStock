An increasing capacity utilization rate is driving lower steel imports in the U.S., which fell 1% from July to August.Higher domestic production may move domestic steel prices lower. Supply concerns are easing; however, the potential ArcelorMittal disruption could create uncertainty again and move domestic steel prices higher.Your email address will not be published.
