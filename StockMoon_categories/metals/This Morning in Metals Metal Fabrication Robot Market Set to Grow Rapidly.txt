From 2017-2021, the market is expected to grow by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.51%.There is growing interest from manufacturers for robot manufacturing technology. According to the report, purchasing managers around the world are looking to buy from metal fabricators which can keep prices low, even during economic downturns.Of course, this isn't great news for human beings who hold these manufacturing jobs, but automation is not going anywhere, whether on the manufacturing side or the usage side (for example: driverless, automated vehicles).As the domestic steel and aluminum industries -- and their counterparts around the globe -- await the announcement of the administration's Section 232 investigation findings, some congressmen are asking the president to limit the scope of any proposed punitive measures on aluminum imports.According to letters obtained by Bloomberg, several congressmen have written to the administration to state their concerns about the potential effects of tariffs on aluminum imports. In letters addressed to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Defense Secretary James Mattis, the legislators argue that tariffs could increase costs for consumers and industrial users of aluminum.One letter, signed by 44 members of the House, indicated a hope for the scope of the 232 ruling to be limited to "only products that are used for national security applications."Whether that will end up being the case remains to be seen. In recent weeks, other countries have expressed concern about the impending 232 rulings, particularly the European Union. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom even said that tariffs will adversely affect the EU producers, and that the EU is considering options for retaliatory measures. Now, even U.S. aluminum companies are expressing concern about rising prices and potential supply-chain disruptions.Bloomberg reported Tuesday that Trump is growing "increasingly frustrated" over what he perceives as China's inaction with respect to North Korea.That political football could find its way into the arena of commerce, as Trump is considering trade remedies against China, according to officials. According to the Bloomberg report, Trump is considering a "range of actions," including tariffs on steel, a well-publicized option which was already on the table as part of the Section 232 investigation launched in April.Free Download: The June 2017 MMI ReportLike with aluminum, it's unclear exactly what the Trump administration will do, even if Trump's rhetoric indicates tariffs are on the way.Your email address will not be published.
