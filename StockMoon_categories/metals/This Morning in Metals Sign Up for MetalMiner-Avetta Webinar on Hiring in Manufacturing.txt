"Unfortunately, effective reductions in capacity and concrete actions to remove government measures that distort markets, including raw materials markets, have not been adequate to date. Efforts by governments to eliminate practices that lead to excess capacity should be redoubled."We are hopeful that the diligent efforts of Japan, the current G20 Chair, are successful in extending the G20 Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity beyond 2019, and we urge all G20 and OECD steelmaking economies to pursue all vigorous means to obtain substantive results on the critical problem of steel excess capacity."Miner Anglo American revised its 2019 copper guidance downward, down to a range of 630,000 tons to 650,000 tons (from a range of 630,000 tons to 660,000 tons), partially as a result of drought conditions in central Chile.Third-quarter copper production reached 159,000 tons, down 8% from 172,000 tons in Q3 2018.
