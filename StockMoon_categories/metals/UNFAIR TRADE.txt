UNFAIR TRADEThe worldwide steel and metals industry was the subject of the biggest number of anti-dumping investigations initiated by members of the World Trade Organisation last year. A report by Rowe & Maw, a corporate-law firm, records 95 cases involving steel and metals--more than a third of the year's total. Of these cases, 37 were started by America, in an attempt to protect its ailing steel industry from foreign competition. The steel business has entered a period of restructuring amid a wave of consolidation by the world's biggest producers. Steel accounted for 80% of America's anti-dumping investigations in 2000, and American companies are clamouring for even more cases this year. In relative terms, the paper and wood industries showed the biggest drop in anti-dumping activity over the past year: 25 cases were begun in 1999, but just eight got going in 2000. Investigations involving textiles and related products also fell sharply, from 37 to 16.
