Meanwhile, 12 countries made the Priority Watch List, those being: Algeria, Argentina, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Kuwait, Russia, Ukraine and Venezuela.China's inclusion on the Priority Watch List marked its 14th consecutive appearance on the list."Longstanding and new IP concerns merit increased attention, including China's coercive technology transfer practices, range of impediments to effective IP enforcement, and widespread infringing activity--including trade secret theft, rampant online piracy, and counterfeit manufacturing," the report states.The 24 countries on the Watch List were: Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Greece, Guatemala, Jamaica, Lebanon, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkey, Turkmenistan, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.The USTR launched a Section 301 probe last August specifically focusing on Chinese trade practices.
