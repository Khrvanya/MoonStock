Zambia suspends 15% duty on gemstones - S.Africa's GemfieldsJOHANNESBURG, Dec 19 (Reuters) - South Africa's Gemfields said on Thursday that the Zambian government has suspended a 15% export duty on gemstones, excluding diamonds, from Jan. 1, 2020. Miners say the duty, announced in a September 2018 budget, has hurt their operations - one pain point in a wider dispute with the mining industry over tax rates.
