1,000L of fungicides stolen from north-east Scotland farmPolice in Scotland are appealing for information about a high-value theft from a farm at Colliston near Arbroath, north-east Scotland.
A storage shed was broken into, and 1,000L of fungicidal spray were taken.
The incident is thought to have happened between 11:00pm on Sunday, August 4, and 7:00am on Monday, August 5.
This particular chemical is no longer commercially available in the UK and is quite valuable as a result.
A spokesman for Tayside Police Division said: "The spray was stored in 10L containers, so a vehicle was more than likely used to take them away.
It should be noted that it is used purely as an agricultural fungicide and is not something that can be used to make other chemical compounds, so we are satisfied that this is a theft and not linked to any other type of crime.
"We are aware that there have been other similar thefts at farms in the north-east of Scotland in the past couple of weeks, and they may well be linked.
