10 days before Dairy Farm Grant application deadlineFarmers interested in applying for the 2019 Dairy Farm Grant have 10 days to do so before the submission deadline closes.
The scheme - which is a joint collaboration between the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and Teagasc - offers support for more efficient vacuum and milk pumps to cut down on both costs and energy loss.
According to the SEAI, the grant provides financial support for the installation of variable speed drive vacuum and milk pump technology.
The grant is only available for the replacement or retrofit of existing vacuum and milk pumps, however, the authority has stressed.
Submissions for the grant - which has more than EUR500,000 available through the scheme this year - have to be sent to the organisation by 12:00pm on Friday, March 29.
The scheme is open to all dairy farmers supplying all major cooperatives. All herd sizes are covered, and both single and three-phase electricity supply is eligible.

To be considered, applicants must: have a supplier number and be currently engaged in milk production; and be registered with the Department of Agriculture under the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme as a herd owner or herd keeper.
