170 more Welsh farmers sign up to livestock efficiency schemeOver 170 farmers from across Wales have been selected to participate in the next round of an animal health planning project to increase the efficiency, profitability and sustainability of their farms.
They join a cohort of 83 participants who initially signed-up for the Stoc+ project and have already begun developing a proactive animal health plan for their herds and flocks.
Stoc+
Stoc+ is one of three projects that form part of Hybu Cig Cymru - Meat Promotion Wales' (HCC) Red Meat Development Programme.
The five-year programme aims to drive the industry forward and help Welsh farming prepare for a future post-Brexit.
It is supported by the Welsh Government Rural Communities - Rural Development Programme 2014-2020, which is funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the Welsh Government.
Farmers were invited to express their interest in the project during a two-week period in July and at the Royal Welsh Show, the HCC held informative talks about the programme with practising vets, Dr. Joe Angell and Clare Jones.

Dr. Rebekah Stuart, HCC's flock and herd health executive, said: "We were delighted with the response and interest in Stoc+ during the latest expression of the interest period.
"It is extremely promising that farmers are keen to get involved to enhance their flock and herd health planning.
A structured, well-thought-out health plan can only reap rewards for a business and help the red meat industry to efficiently produce high-quality products that meet the demands of consumers.
During the project, targets to improve the health status of the farm will be set and agreed with the farmer, with regular visits and support from their local vet and HCC for up to three years to monitor progress.
Dr. Stuart added: "Our aim is to engage with up to 500 sheep and beef producers from across Wales in this work, which means that there will be further opportunities for more farmers to get involved."
