The highest daily rainfall total was 53.2mm at Dunsany, Co. Meath on March 2 during Storm Emma.
Temperatures
An above-average temperature overall was recorded in almost all stations, according to Met Eireann, though only slightly above average in most places.
This was due to February, March, September and October all being colder than average - counteracting the very warm summer - the report details.
The highest yearly mean temperature was 11.2deg at Sherkin Island, Co. Cork, while the lowest yearly mean temperature was 8.9deg at Knock Airport, Co. Mayo.
The highest daily temperature was 32.0deg reported at Shannon Airport on June 28 - a record for a synoptic station.

A cold and dry February finished with a polar continental air mass. This brought snow showers with significant accumulations in the east and south.

Storm Emma at the beginning of March gave widespread snow in a cold and changeable month. The unsettled theme continued during April with temperatures near normal.
May started changeable but overall it was a warm dry and sunny month with high pressure dominating.
The settled conditions continued for most of June and July apart from Storm Hector in the middle of June, which brought wet and windy weather briefly.
Heatwave and drought conditions in many places towards the end of June continued into early July in several places, lasting longest in the south and east - playing havoc on growth conditions for farmers.
Changeable weather returned towards the end of July and continued in the north and west for much of August. The south and east stayed predominantly warm and dry.
September and October were cool and dry, according to the report; however, Storm Ali brought the strongest winds of the year on September 19 followed by Storm Bronagh, and Storm Callum on October 12.

It was mild and unsettled for most of November with Storm Diana on November 28.
