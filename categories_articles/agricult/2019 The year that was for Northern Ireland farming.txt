2020 is already shaping up to be the start of what could be a defining decade for Northern Ireland agriculture - let's just hope it's the start of another 'Roaring '20s'.
2019 review
Looking back on the year that was I've trawled through the AgriLand archives to bring you a handful of the biggest stories of the year:
It all started off so promising. In February, the Ulster Farmers' Union announced it had smashed its PS100,000 target for the air ambulance.

The union set itself the ambitious target of raising PS1,000 for each of its 100 years, but when the final amount was tallied, the figure totalled a phenomenal PS200,000. A massive well done to everyone who baked, climbed mountains or sold calendars for the cause.

On the farm safety front, June saw a very lucky escape for a Fermanagh farmer. The man in his 70s, who was rescued by another man in his 40s, lost consciousness in a slurry accident.
However, sadly, in November, things didn't end so well - we had our first and only farm death of the year when a 14-year-old girl was killed on a farm in Newry.

2019 was the year of the pig in more than just the Chinese Zodiac. In July, the chief vet confirmed that African Swine Fever had reached the UK for the first time.
Traces of the disease were detected in airport contraband in Northern Ireland but intervention from department officials at the portal prevented it from going any further.
