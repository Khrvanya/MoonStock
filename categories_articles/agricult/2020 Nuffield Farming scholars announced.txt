2020 Nuffield Farming scholars announcedThe recipients of next year's 19 Nuffield farming scholars have been named.
The cohort come from across UK agriculture, food and rural industries and will travel around the globe to study their chosen topic seeking guidance from industry leaders, experts and pioneers.
The scholarships will be formally awarded at the Nuffield Farming Conference, held November 27-29 at Chesford Grange in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, after which, the scholars will commence their 18 months of travel and study.
Mike Vacher, Nuffield director said: "UK agriculture is navigating through a period of uncertainty and change - environmentally, socially and politically.
"Our 2020 scholars were selected from a talented and passionate group of applicants for their ability to lead positive change in their sectors, as well as their potential to inspire others to do the same over the course of their travels and beyond.
The Scholarship offers a once-in-a-lifetime chance to connect with and learn from the best of the international food and farming community.
"The knowledge and experiences they will bring back to the UK will be incredibly valuable as our industry moves forward, and this wouldn't be possible without the generous support of our sponsors.
