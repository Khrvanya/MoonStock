20ac of Meath land with road frontage to go for auctionA 20ac non-residential farm at Newtownmoynagh, Longwood Road, Trim, Co. Meath, will go for auction at Trim Castle Hotel on Wednesday, March 6 at 3:00pm.
"The lands are very fertile and are in permanent pasture, with no waste. They have the benefit of being watered by a continuous stream. They also benefit from extensive road frontage.
"They are suitable for the erection of a private dwelling house, subject to the necessary planning permission," said selling agent Aidan Heffernan of Sherry FitzGerald Royal. There are several one-off houses on the road.
"The lands have been leased to a local farmer for the past number of years and are maintained to a high standard," he said.
Current land sales average between EUR10,000 and EUR12,000/ac, with land leasing averaging approximately EUR200/ac/annum.
"There is a very strong demand for long-term leasing, which is tax-efficient for the land owner. The knock-on effect is the availability of land for con-acre is reduced."
The 20ac holding is adjacent to Co. Meath golf club, on the R160 Trim/Longwood road, approximately 4km from Trim. The club was established in 1898 and the course was extended to 18 holes in 1993 and a new clubhouse developed.

Situated on the River Boyne, Trim has a population of approximately 9,000.
"This charming, well planned town attracts a large number of visitors and has now developed a reputation as being the gourmet capital of the north-east.
"The town has a host of excellent hotels including Knightsbrook; Trim Castle; and Castle Arch and has established itself as a go-to location for dining out with a number of first-class restaurants," Aidan said.
"The town is noted for Trim Castle - the largest Anglo-Norman castle in Ireland. Trim has won the prestigious Tidy Towns Competition several times, including a gold medal in 2014, highlighting the strong sense of community," the agent said.
"Trim has excellent schools including five primary and two secondary schools. There is a regular bus service to Blanchardstown and Dublin city," he concluded.
The land has a guide price of EUR250,000. For further details, contact Aidan Heffernan at Sherry FitzGerald Royal on: 046-9431525.
