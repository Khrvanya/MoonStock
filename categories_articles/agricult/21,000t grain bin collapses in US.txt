21,000t grain bin collapses in USA grain bin, which was reportedly holding 21,591t - or 850,000 bushels - of corn collapsed in the US state of Missouri, in the early hours of Monday morning (March 11).
The grain made its way onto the nearby road and also blocked a railway line once its container's walls split. Thankfully no one was injured in the incident, which happened at a Bunge plant in LaGrange, Missouri.
According to reports, crews were working on one side of the bin when it collapsed. The bin had been filled the day previous. Investigators are trying to establish what caused the collapse.
Access to the railway line was restored promptly, while the road was closed. The clean up is expected to take a number of weeks as metal and grain all have to be collected from the site.
