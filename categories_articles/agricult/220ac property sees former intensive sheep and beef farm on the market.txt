220ac property sees former intensive sheep and beef farm on the marketA unique opportunity to purchase a 220ac roadside farm for sale has come on the market in Faha, Kilmacthomas, Co. Waterford.
The property is convenient to all natural amenities of the mid-Waterford area. It is located just off the N25 Cork to Waterford road at Faha, while Kilmacthomas is only 4km in distance, Dungarven is 20km away and Waterford is 30km.
The Waterford area is renowned for equestrian pursuits, while sporting enthusiasts can enjoy the Waterford Hunt, Dungarvan Harriers, Dungarvan Foxhounds and Dungarvan Farmers Hunt which are all in the catchment area as well.
Prime location
The property is a former sheep and beef farm. It is situated on an elevated site with panoramic views of the Comeragh Mountains and surrounding countryside.

As well as the land, the property boasts a dwelling, yard and farm buildings (located adjacent to the residence). The land itself divides naturally into four roadside divisions.

It is for sale in five lots:

Lot 2: 103.15ac with residence and farm buildings;
Lot 3: 29.3ac;
Lot 4: 15.36ac;

All lots are excellent quality permanent pasture and are laid out in good-sized divisions for easy management, which have been farmed to a highest standard by the tenants.

The land has extensive road frontage on two roads.

The farm buildings include: a slatted house; two walled silage pits; a purpose built sheep shed; a six span hayshed; and a range of cutstone slated outbuildings, currently lambing pens - which are also suitable for use as stables.
