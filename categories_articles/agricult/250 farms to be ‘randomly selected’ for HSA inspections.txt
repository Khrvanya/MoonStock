250 farms to be ‘randomly selected’ for HSA inspectionsThe Health and Safety Authority (HSA) will commence an "intensive farm safety inspection campaign" beginning next Monday, January 28.
There will be a focus on the safe management of livestock during calving season when the risk of injury to farmers increases significantly.
A statement from the HSA explained that livestock is the number one cause of accidents on Irish farms - accounting for 42% of all injuries.
In relation to fatalities, incidents involving livestock are the second most common cause.
In the 10 year period 2009 - 2018, 16% of all fatal farm accidents (33 deaths) were livestock related, with over half of these (18 deaths) involving cows and heifers.
Senior inspector with the HSA Pat Griffin explained: "Although 2018 saw a 40% decline in farm fatalities, there are still far too many deaths in the agriculture sector as well as a substantial number of very serious injuries.
Working with livestock is a key incident trigger and there is no room for complacency among farmers.
"During calving period, increased fatigue and stress levels are common. However, early planning and preparation can make a significant difference in the safe management of livestock and help prevent injury or even death".

Key areas of focus during the inspection campaign will include:

Is there a plan in place to minimise the risk of attack from a cow when handling a calf to tag, dip navel or stomach tube?
Has an adequate physical barrier been established between the farmer and the freshly calved cow when tagging, treating and handling calves?
Are facilities and procedures adequate for loading and unloading animals?There will be a focus on the safe management of livestock during calving season when the risk of injury to farmers increases significantly.
