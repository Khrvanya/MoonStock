3 effective ways of controlling Johne’s disease this calving seasonWith the calving season almost upon us, it is good idea to keep the necessary steps in mind to limit the spread of a costly disease like Johne's.
For those unfamiliar with this disease, Johne's is a bacterial disease of cattle, which can prove costly on farms.
According to Animal Health Ireland (AHI), infection normally occurs when young calves drink colostrum and milk or eat feed contaminated with the bacteria known to cause the disease.
Calves are the most susceptible animals on a farm to this disease - for which there is no cure. Even a very small amount of dung on a dirty udder can contain enough bacteria to infect a suckling calf.
On occasion, calves can already be infected at birth. This is common when the dam has advanced disease.
Signs of Johne's disease:

Reduced production, lower milk yields and lower feed conversion efficiency;
Weight loss, despite a good appetite;
Scour (not bloody) and, ultimately, emaciation;
Soft swelling of the jaw or brisket;
Death.For those unfamiliar with this disease, Johne's is a bacterial disease of cattle, which can prove costly on farms.
