  A peek into granny’s kitchenWinter reminds me of the innumerable lessons grandpa would give us cousins on the crops growing in our fields in Ambala. We would go there each year, but more than the lessons we were keen on eating delicacies grandma cooked for us. Bajra would intrigue me because it is a sturdy crop; it can grow in sandy soil, high temperatures, and can make do with little water.

Every night, we felt extremely important as we organized a bonfire out of dry straw collected from the fields. And then it was left to grandma to make bajre ki bhakri and other delicacies on the bonfire.

My personal favourite was bajre ki kheer.
    

Nobody in my family has been able to recreate that taste, partly because there is no bonfire any more; nor is granny's warm and loving touch.

City life and job stress are to blame for changed food habits. Most families now have just about enough time for ready-mix recipes and instant food. Bajra's uses though have diversified: from being a poor man's food it is part of rich man's health diet.

The other day, as I was basking under the winter sun at home, I had this epiphany. It came with a sense of guilt: like us, our children must know what it is to eat nutritious food such as bajra kheer, khichdi and bhakri.

I called my mother and brushed up on the bajre ki bhakri recipe. To my delight, my children loved it.
