The Green Awards were established in 2008 with the aim of recognising companies for taking steps towards sustainable production.
ABP highlighted a recent plastic packaging initiative as evidence of its green credentials.
The company formed the 'Plastic Action Alliance', which it claims is the first initiative of its kind, and is aimed at making plastic packaging more sustainable.
A well as that, the group's UK division is about to launch meat-free, plant-based quarter pounder burgers, though that move has been met with criticism.
Patrick Kent, president of the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers' Association (ICSA) claimed that these plans were "outrageous" and an "insult to farmers", arguing that introducing such products was inappropriate at a time when the beef sector was facing such challenges.
However, ABP highlighted that it first entered the meat-free sector in 2011, arguing that its core business "is and will remain beef", and that it was catering to the changing demands of customers.
