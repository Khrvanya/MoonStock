AHDB campaign makes strides in reversing falling dairy consumption11% more young parents will buy dairy products according to research carried out after the second year of AHDB and Dairy UK's marketing campaign.
The study also showed an 8% fall in the number of people cutting their dairy consumption, along with an 11% reduction in intentions to consume plant-based substitutes.
Targeting 20 to 35-year-old parents, the promotional activity used humour to share moments when dairy makes life better through the spoof organisation 'The Department of Dairy Related Scrumptious Affairs'.
Rebecca Miah, AHDB head of dairy marketing, said: "We knew dairy was being overlooked as a category so it's fantastic to see that people are responding positively to the campaign and reigniting their love of dairy."
The campaign - which launched in 2017 - aims to remind people of their love of dairy focusing on taste, enjoyment and the moments that make life better.
