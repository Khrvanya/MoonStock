AHDB launches new technical beef eventsThe Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) has announced it will launch a series of one-day technical events looking at key areas of beef production.
A wide range of topics will be covered in 'Talking Beef 2019' and the programme will include in both classroom and field-based workshops with interactive sessions and question and answer sessions throughout the day.
The events will also include expert speakers from AHDB, independent consultants and leading industry partners.
The topics include beef profitability drivers, grassland and soils, beef health, nutrition, plus a technology village showcasing the very latest in innovation and technology.
Joseph Keating, senior knowledge exchange manager at AHDB, said: "The Beef & Lamb Knowledge Exchange team has focused on using feedback from farmers to shape events to suit their needs. We've noticed a significant uplift in attendees and we're thrilled more people are taking time to attend.
"We understand it can be difficult to get time away from the farm, so the Talking Beef events last the full day but allow us to cover a larger range of topics than at a project-specific event.
