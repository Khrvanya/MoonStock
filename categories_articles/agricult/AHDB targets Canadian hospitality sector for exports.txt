AHDB targets Canadian hospitality sector for exportsQuality beef, lamb and pork from the UK will be in the spotlight when AHDB exhibits at the Restaurants Canada Show this weekend.
Five exporters will join AHDB on the stand at Canada's largest foodservice and hospitality event, which starts in Toronto on Sunday.
It's the first time AHDB has attended the three-day event, which will this year host more than 150 speakers as well as three leadership conferences and four networking events.
Canada is a key target market for red meat exporters as meat consumption is currently 2.4 times the global average per capita and is predicted to rise further.
Currently, the US is Canada's biggest trading partner, however, New Zealand and Australia supply 93% of all lamb to the country.

With the UK's high animal welfare standards, our products are of great interest to Canadian consumers and we are confident that the show will prove incredibly beneficial for our exporters.
Also, on the stand will be chef Shovgui Agayev, who will be cooking a selection of dishes to showcase the high quality of red meat from the UK.
