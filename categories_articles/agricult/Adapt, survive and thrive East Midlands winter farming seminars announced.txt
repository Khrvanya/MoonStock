"With the current unpredictability in farm incomes, we will look at opportunities for farm businesses to raise additional income streams from diversification possibilities and discuss how that may affect them from a tax perspective," said Dodds.
Hamish Bichan from Active Business Partnerships is clear that there is a need for practical guidance in uncertain times.
"The UK agricultural farming system will be one of the sectors most affected, if, and when, we exit the EU and the seminars will look at what the future holds for rural businesses," he said.
"Other critical issues covered will be the increasing need to farm for the environment and the many benefits associated with sustainable farming practices, as well as an insight into what we know about the future."
The Active Business Partnerships team will be attending both the Stamford and Lincoln seminars, to answer queries and to offer guidance on planning for the future.
