Agricultural haulage company fined after driver falls from trailerA Highland agricultural haulage firm has been fined PS8,000 after a driver fell from a trailer sustaining severe injuries.
Perth Sheriff Court heard that on February 9, 2016, an employee of W. D. Cormack & Sons of Castletown, Thurso, was securing a load of grain bags on a curtain-sider trailer, at Thormean Granary, Milnathort, when he fell 2.88m from the trailer to the ground.
An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) identified that there was a failure to make a suitable and sufficient risk assessment and a failure to provide and maintain a safe system of work.
W.D. Cormack & Sons of, Castletown, Thurso pleaded guilty to breaching Section 2(1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and was fined PS8,000

Speaking after the hearing, HSE inspector Norman Schouten said: "This incident could have been avoided by implementing effective measures to control work at height on trailers.
Load securing systems, which allow drivers to secure loads from the ground, can be easily fitted to curtain-siders.
"Companies should be aware that HSE will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action against those that fall below the required standard."
