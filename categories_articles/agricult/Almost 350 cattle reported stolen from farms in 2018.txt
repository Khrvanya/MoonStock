What to do if cattle are stolen
The department noted that all incidents of stolen animals should therefore be reported to An Garda Siochana by the relevant keeper, for investigation.
Where an incident of cattle theft occurs, the owner/keeper of the stolen animals should also notify the appropriate Regional Veterinary Office (RVO) in writing, including details of animals stolen, date of theft and evidence that the incident has been reported to An Garda Siochana.
The RVO subsequently liaises with the department's AIM Division in ensuring that the animals are recorded as stolen on the AIM system. Records of all reported stolen livestock are maintained centrally by AIM Division.
