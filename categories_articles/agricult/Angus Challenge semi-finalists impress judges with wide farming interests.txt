Angus Challenge semi-finalists impress judges with wide farming interestsTeams of young people vying for the chance to rear their own Angus-cross calves have impressed judges with their interest in some of farming's biggest issues.
More than 50 young people representing 13 schools from right across Northern Ireland competed at the semi-finals of the 2019 ABP Youth Challenge.
The challenge, which is now in its second year in the region, is an agri-skills development competition for teenagers wanting to work in agri-food. However, in a twist, the Angus Youth competition sees the teens rear and profit from their own batches of calves.

The semi-finalists had to impress an independent panel of 12 judges about their knowledge of premium Northern Irish Angus beef production and particular aspects of Northern Ireland farming and food that interested them.
Ideas explored ranged from the use of technology to educate consumers on traceability and food provenance to farm safety and mental health in rural communities; how to connect cities with the country; and the link between sustainability and profitability.

The pupils who ranged from 14-16 years of age were representing:
