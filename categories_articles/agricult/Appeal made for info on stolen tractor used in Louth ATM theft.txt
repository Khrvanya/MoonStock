Appeal made for info on stolen tractor used in Louth ATM theftAn appeal for information has been made in relation to the stolen tractor used in the attempted theft of an ATM machine in Co. Louth over the weekend.
Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) officers in Crossmaglen, Co. Armagh, are appealing for information in relation to the theft of a Massey Ferguson tractor and a low loader from a property in the Concession Road area of Cullaville.
It is believed that the vehicles were stolen sometime between 2:30pm on Friday, November 15, and 2:40am on Saturday November 16, and then used in an attack on an ATM machine across the border in Co Louth, at Dunleer.
The low loader was recovered at the scene and the tractor at Hackballscross. Both have since been returned to their respective owners.
