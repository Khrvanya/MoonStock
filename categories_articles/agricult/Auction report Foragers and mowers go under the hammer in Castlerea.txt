Auction report Foragers and mowers go under the hammer in CastlereaA clearance auction - involving a significant fleet of contracting machinery - took place on Saturday (February 2).
The sale was held close to Castlerea, Co. Roscommon. The entries came chiefly from one contracting fleet - namely that of David Connolly.
The auctioneer was Micheal Doyle.

Much of the talk ahead of the sale revolved around the two forage harvesters - both John Deere machines.
The newer of the two was this 7400 (pictured below). According to the auctioneer, it's a 2006 machine and had 3,910 engine hours and 2,795 drum hours on the clock. It sold for EUR39,000 plus VAT and plus 3% commission.

All in (including VAT, the commission and the VAT on the commission itself), the total sale price was EUR49,409.

The second machine was older - a 6710 (pictured below). The auctioneer says that this 1997 example was showing 3,800 engine hours and 2,760 drum hours.

Bidding topped out at EUR14,000 plus VAT and plus 3% commission. However, this wasn't quite enough. Negotiations with the highest bidder are, apparently, still open.

The 6710 appeared to be in reasonably good condition - for a forager of its age.
Apart from the two harvesters, other silage equipment was offered at the auction.
Included in the line-up, for example, was this (2016) Krone 3201 CV trailed mower-conditioner (pictured below). It sold for EUR15,550 plus VAT and plus 3% commission.

All in (including VAT, the commission and the VAT on the commission itself), the total sale price was EUR19,700.
It wasn't the only such machine; there were also similar units from Taarup (Kverneland) in the mix (pictured below).

The 4228 LT in the background didn't sell. It was believed that this machine had been sold, but it later emerged that the top bid - EUR2,950 plus VAT and plus 5% commission - was not sufficient.
The 4028 (with a grouper/swather) in the foreground sold for EUR5,000 plus VAT and plus 5% commission.

Auction report: EUR55,000 (all in) for a 2002 Valtra Valmet 8950 in Co. Roscommon 




All in (including VAT, the commission and the VAT on the commission itself), the total sale price was EUR19,700.
It wasn't the only such machine; there were also similar units from Taarup (Kverneland) in the mix (pictured below).

The 4228 LT in the background didn't sell. It was believed that this machine had been sold, but it later emerged that the top bid - EUR2,950 plus VAT and plus 5% commission - was not sufficient.
The 4028 (with a grouper/swather) in the foreground sold for EUR5,000 plus VAT and plus 5% commission.
