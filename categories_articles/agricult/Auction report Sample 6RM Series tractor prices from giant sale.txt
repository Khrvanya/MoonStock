Auction report Sample 6RM Series tractor prices from giant saleAn auction involving the disposal of a considerable fleet of tractors and equipment from the UK-based Hawk Plant hire group took place late last week (Thursday, March 14, and Friday, March 15).
Along with a very significant number of plant/construction machines, well over 100 tractors were up for grabs. The tractors were sold on the first day of the sale.

Tim Scrivener was there (at Charleston House, Cruckmoor Lane, Prees Green, Whitchurch, Shropshire) for AgriLand. He snapped these shots as proceedings unfolded.
The sale was conducted by Euro Auctions.
