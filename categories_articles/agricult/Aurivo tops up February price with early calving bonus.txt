Aurivo tops up February price with early calving bonusNorth-west dairy giant Aurivo has become the latest processor to reveal its milk price for February supplies, announcing a top-up on its January figure.
Following a meeting today (Friday, March 15), the board of Aurivo has decided to pay a price of 32c/L for February milk, according to a spokesperson for the co-operative.
This is inclusive of a 1.5c/L unconditional early calving bonus.
The 30.5c/L base price has been held from last month.
The board will continue to monitor market conditions carefully in the coming months, the processor representative added.

On Wednesday, Kerry Group announced a cut to its February milk price.
According to a spokesperson for the firm, the Kerry Group base price for February milk supplies is 31c/L including VAT.
Based on average February milk solids, the price return including VAT and bonuses is 35.56c/L.
In addition (excluding milk supplied under fixed price contracts) the group is paying 0.5c/L on milk supplied from May 1, 2018, to end of December 2018, which exceeds the milk contract price commitment, the company representative said.
