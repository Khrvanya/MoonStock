Austria unsuccessful in banning glyphosateFor the time being, Austria will not proceed with a ban on glyphosate which was due to begin on January 1. The country had drawn up draft legislation to ban glyphosate-based herbicides.
However, according to reports, earlier this month Austrian Chancellor Brigitte Bierlein stated that the ban was not going ahead for legal reasons.
The Irish Grain and Feed Association (IGFA) submitted a notification detail to the EU on the Federal Act amending the 2011 Plant Protection Products Act.

It was proposed to replace this with: "The placing on the market of plant protection products containing the active substance glyphosate is prohibited in accordance with the precautionary principle."
What did the IGFA say?
The IGFA submitted the following: "The use of the precautionary principle as justification for this move erodes the argument that the internal market in the EU is based on common scientific principles and is an example of individual member states undermining confidence in our EU scientific bodies such as EFSA.
"IGFA will continue to encourage the Irish authorities to take a science-based approach to its decision-making process."
