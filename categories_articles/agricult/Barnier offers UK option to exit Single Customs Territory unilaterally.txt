Barnier offers UK option to exit Single Customs Territory unilaterallyChief EU negotiator for Brexit Michel Barnier has offered the UK the option to exit the Single Customs Territory unilaterally - if the other elements of the backstop are maintained to avoid a hard border.
In a statement through a series of tweets on social media providing an update on the ongoing negotiations, Barnier revealed the news today (Friday, March 8).
In the statement, the chief negotiator said: "I briefed EU27 ambassadors and the European Parliament today on the ongoing talks with UK. Following the EU-UK statement of February 20, the EU has proposed to the UK a legally binding interpretation of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. Most importantly:

4/5 EU commits to give UK the option to exit the Single Customs Territory unilaterally, while the other elements of the backstop must be maintained to avoid a hard border. UK will not be forced into customs union against its will.

"The arbitration panel can already, under Article 178 WA, give UK the right to a proportionate suspension of its obligations under the backstop, as a last resort, if the EU breaches its best endeavours/good faith obligations to negotiate alternative solutions.
"The EU is ready to give legal force to all commitments from January letter of Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker through joint interpretative statement. This will render best endeavour/good faith obligations even more actionable by an arbitration panel.
EU commits to give UK the option to exit the Single Customs Territory unilaterally, while the other elements of the backstop must be maintained to avoid a hard border. UK will not be forced into customs union against its will.
"The EU will continue working intensively over the coming days to ensure that the UK leaves the EU with an agreement," he added.
