Beef trade Backlog still in place when it comes to bull processingThe bull saga has continued on as of late, with many farmers facing difficulties when it comes to marketing these animals in beef factories.
Because off the delay, some farmers are running into 'overage'  and 'overweight' problems. Even farmers who regularly finish bulls and produce large numbers are encountering problems. Again, farmers need to talk with their factory agents before marketing these types of animals.
For the most part, O-grades are trading for 350-360c/kg, while R-grades are moving for 360c/kg; procurement managers are quoting 370c/kg for U-grading bulls.
However, lower prices have been reported and this is severely damaging farmers' confidence. The prime trade has remained unchanged and factories are still offering 375c/kg for steers and 385c/kg for heifers.
260-270c/kg is on offer for P-grade animals. In addition, procurement managers are starting negotiations with farmers for O-grade cows at 280c/kg and R-grading cows are hovering around the 300-310c/kg mark.
Weekly supplies
During the week ending January 20, the number of cattle processed by Department of Agriculture beef export plants increased marginally.
That week, 36,656 cattle were slaughtered by beef processors - up from 35,810 the week before. During the same week in 2017, some 33,256 cattle were processed.

The number of young bulls processed amounted to 5,646 head - a fall of 577 head.
In addition, the number of cows slaughtered increased slightly. The number of cows processed by Irish beef plants stood at 7,398 - an increase of 144 head.
Some 11,308 factory-fit bullocks were slaughtered - a jump of 640 head, while 11,826 heifers were processed during the week ending January 20 - up 670 head during the week before. Furthermore, some 92 fewer aged bulls were slaughtered.
