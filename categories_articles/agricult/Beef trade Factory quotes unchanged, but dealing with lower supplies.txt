Beef trade Factory quotes unchanged, but dealing with lower suppliesA total number of 35,869 (excluding calves) beef cattle were processed during the week ending February 24 - a 1,172 head decrease on the week before.
And, as has been the case over the past number of weeks, beef factories are quick to quote prices of 375c/kg for steers and 385c/kg for factory-ready heifers.
Moving to bulls this week, factory agents are quoting 330-340c/kg for O-grade bulls, while R-grades are moving for 350-360c/kg; procurement managers are quoting 360-370c/kg for U-grades.
Again, weight restrictions are causing some farmers problems when it comes to marketing their bulls.
Beef buyers are starting negotiations with farmers for cows at 260c/kg for P-grade cows; poorer-quality cows are achieving lower prices.
In addition, 280-290c/kg is on the table for O-grade animals and 300c/kg is being quoted for R-grade cows. However, the location and demand of individual processing plants plays a role in the price being quoted to farmers for cows.
