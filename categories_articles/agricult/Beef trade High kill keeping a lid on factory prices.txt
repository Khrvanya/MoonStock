Beef trade High kill keeping a lid on factory pricesThe recent high-kill trend has continued in Department of Agriculture beef exporting plants and this is helping to keep a cap on prices paid to farmers from the beef processors.
Looking at the latest data available, we can see that 37,700 head of cattle were slaughtered in beef plants during the week ending February 3. Even though this is a fall of 349 head on the previous week's kill, it is still high given the time of year.
Procurement managers are still operating off a base of 375c/kg for steers and at 385c/kg for factory-fit heifers, with no reports of any higher quotes.
Bulls still remain problematic in some plants. This week, factory agents are quoting 330-340c/kg for O-grade bulls, while R-grades are moving for 360c/kg; procurement managers are quoting 370c/kg for U-grading bulls and maybe 5c/kg higher in some cases.
Most beef cattle buyers are starting negotiations with farmers at 300c/kg for R-grade cows and 280-290c/kg for O-grade types. Looking at cows falling into the P-grade category, these animals are selling at 260-270c/kg.
The beef kill
Breaking the 37,700 head of cattle that were slaughtered during the week ending February 3 into individual categories, some 6,427 young bulls were slaughtered that week - a fall of just 58 head.
