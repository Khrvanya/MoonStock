Beef trade No St. Patrick’s Day boost for cattle pricesSt. Patrick's Day has come and gone and - for the most part - factory quotes remain unchanged when it comes to steers, heifers and cows; however, bulls remain variable.
Prices for steers continue at 375c/kg, while base quotes for heifers stand at 385c/kg. However, there are reports of some factories pulling prices, leaving bullocks at 370c/kg and heifers 10c/kg higher at 380c/kg.
There is better news on the cow front with prices holding steady. Beef buyers are starting negotiations with farmers for cows at 260-270c/kg for P-grade cows; poorer-quality cows are achieving lower prices.
In addition, 280-290c/kg is on the table for O-grade animals and 300c/kg upwards is being quoted for R-grade cows. However, the location and demand of individual processing plants plays a role in the price being quoted to farmers for cows.
The bull trade remains difficult. Factory agents are quoting 310-340c/kg for O-grade bulls, while R-grades are moving for 340-350c/kg; procurement managers are quoting 360-370c/kg for U-grades.
Again, weight restrictions are causing some farmers problems when it comes to marketing their bulls.
Cattle supplies
Some 35,788 head of cattle were slaughtered in Department of Agriculture approved beef exporting plants during the week ending March 17.
If we exclude calves, the total number amounts to 34,154 head. When compared to the previous week's kill, all categories recorded a decrease.
