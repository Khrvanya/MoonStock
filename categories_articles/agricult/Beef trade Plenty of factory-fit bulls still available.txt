Beef trade Plenty of factory-fit bulls still availableThis week, the steer and heifer trade has remained unchanged. However, procurement managers have noted that there is still plenty of factory-fit bulls available for slaughter.
This has followed on from the Christmas period when bulls prices came under pressure. For the most part, O-grades are trading for 350-360c/kg, while R-grades are moving for 370c/kg; procurement managers are quoting 380c/kg for U-grading bulls.
With the high numbers of bulls available for slaughter, farmers are advised to speak with their factories when it comes to marketing these animals, as Friesian bulls are under increased pressure.
However, some factories are implementing price cuts on 'overweight' bulls. Again, farmers need to consult with factory agents.
Moving to heifers and bullocks, quotes remain unchanged for these animals and stand at 375c/kg for steers and 385c/kg for slaughter-ready heifers.
Similar to the bull trade, there seems to be plenty of cows available for slaughter, and thus, cow prices remain unchanged.
260c/kg is on offer for P-grade animals. In addition, procurement managers are starting negotiations with farmers for O-grade cows at 270c/kg and R-grading cows are hovering around the 300c/kg mark.
Cattle supplies
Cattle throughput is heading back towards the pre-Christmas period, with 35,810 head of cattle slaughtered in Department of Agriculture approved beef export plants during the week ending January 13.
Factories are making their way through the large number of bulls available for slaughter and this is evident in the bull kill. The number of young bulls slaughtered increased from 5,075 head to 6,223 head - an increase of 1,148 head.
