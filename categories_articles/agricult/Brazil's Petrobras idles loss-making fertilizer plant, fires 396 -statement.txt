Petrobras said in a statement it has been trying to sell the nitrogen fertilizer unit unsuccessfully for more than two years, adding it will fire its 396 employees as a result of the decision. In the 9 months ending in September of 2019, Petrobras said the subsidiary lost 250 million reais ($60.4 million).   Reporting by Ana ManoAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
