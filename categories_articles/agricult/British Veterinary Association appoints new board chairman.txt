British Veterinary Association appoints new board chairmanThe British Veterinary Association (BVA) is pleased to announce Steve Anderson Dixon as its new board chairman.
Anderson Dixon, who had previously served as a BVA board director since 2017, has nearly 40 years of experience in publishing and has spent the last five years engaged in the migration of print to digital publishing.

Until recently, he was the chief operating officer Trinity Mirror regionals division following its acquisition of Local World Media Group.
Prior to this, he was the managing director of Trinity Mirror Regionals from November 2014 and was responsible for iconic brands such as The Manchester Evening News, Liverpool Echo and Western Mail.
He is currently the chief executive officer of JBP Associates Ltd., a national communications agency and is a non-executive director on several other boards including The Publica Group and InVesta Property.
He has also held a number of non-executive director roles at organisations including Teletext, Extra Care Charitable Trust, Roosevelt Scholarship, and has previous experience as chairman of Nottingham Regeneration.

It consists of nine members: the three BVA officers (president, senior vice-president and junior vice-president); four directors elected by BVA Council; and up to two non-veterinary directors appointed by the AGM.
Steve was elected as a non-veterinary director at BVA's AGM in September 2017. He takes over from Philip Lowndes, who had served as BVA's board chairman since April 2017.

"Steve has high-level strategic experience across a range of sectors that will be a great asset to BVA as we embark on a new year and focus on developing the quality services and support we offer to our members.
His long and successful career in newspaper and magazine publishing will be particularly useful as BVA continues to develop our most valued member benefit: Our portfolio of veterinary journals.
"I'd also like to take the opportunity to thank Philip Lowndes for all the hard work he has put in as our board chairman over the last few years.
