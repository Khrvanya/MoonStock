CAFRE beef finishing event to take place this ThursdayA knowledge transfer event taking place at Greenmount College this week aims to discuss some of the biggest areas of concern for Northern Irish beef farmers.
The event run by the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise (CAFRE) will discuss feeding options and demonstrate practical ideas to maximise market returns.
The efficient production of beef in an environmentally responsible manner continues to be of vital importance to the Northern Ireland industry.
Around 80% of the beef processed in Northern Ireland is destined for Britain with the remaining 20% exported to the EU Market.
The majority of this beef is for the high-value retail and foodservice markets hence producing what the market requires is of utmost importance.
