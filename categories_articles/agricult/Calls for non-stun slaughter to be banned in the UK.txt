Calls for non-stun slaughter to be banned in the UKThe UK government is being called on to repeal a legal exemption that permits animals to be slaughtered without pre-stunning, causing "unnecessary pain and suffering".
Made in a joint appeal by the British Veterinary Association (BVA) and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), the two organisations have cited figures from 2017/18 which show that over 120 million animals were slaughtered without being stunned first.
This amounts to more than three animals slaughtered every second on average, they claim.
Open letter
In an open letter to Environment Secretary Michael Gove, the BVA and the RSPCA have urged the UK government to change legislation in England which currently allows non-stun slaughter for religious purposes.
They also call for the provision of further public transparency on this issue by releasing the comprehensive 2018 slaughter survey results, which were originally due for release in autumn 2018.
Until such legislation is in place the RSPCA and BVA are calling for the following:

Meat to be labelled with the method of slaughter - stunned or non-stunned - so consumers are fully informed about the meat that they are buying;
Non-stun slaughter to only be permitted at levels that meet local religious community demand for this type of meat in the interests of limiting animal pain and suffering;
A ban on export of meat from non-stunned animals or live animals destined for non-stun slaughter;
An immediate post-cut stun for cattle, sheep, goats and deer to reduce the period of pain and distress.Made in a joint appeal by the British Veterinary Association (BVA) and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), the two organisations have cited figures from 2017/18 which show that over 120 million animals were slaughtered without being stunned first.
