Cattle marts Quiet start as the first sales of 2019 take placeLast week was quiet on the mart trade front as most cattle sales around the country have not yet resumed for 2019; however, this week will see more sales commencing.
From those marts that had their opening sale of 2019, it was reported that there was an improvement in the trade for all types - mainly due to the smaller numbers presented for sale.
However, some mart managers noted that prices struggled compared to the pre-Christmas period.
Although it is still early for the majority of spring-calving dairy herds to commence calving, it won't be long until calf sales are up and running.
