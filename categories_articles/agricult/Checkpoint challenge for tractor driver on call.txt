Fail to see road signs;
Fail to maintain proper lane position and steady speed;
Are more likely to "tailgate" the vehicle in front;
React more slowly and take longer to brake;
Are more likely to enter unsafe gaps in traffic; and
Feel more stressed and frustrated.PSNI officers based in Co. Fermanagh conducted a number of vehicle checkpoints last Saturday, September 21, detecting "several" motoring offences.
