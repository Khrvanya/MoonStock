China plans to issue GMO safety certificates for soybean and corn1 Min ReadBEIJING, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China's agriculture ministry said on Monday it plans to issue genetically modified (GM) safety certificates to a domestically grown soybean crop and two corn crops, a move seen as loosening restrictions on GM grain crops in the world's top market. China will issue the certificate to SHZD32-01 soybean developed by Shanghai Jiaotong University, given there is no objection during the 15-day period soliciting public opinion, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said in a statement on its website. Dabeinong's DBN9936 corn, and another corn crop variety developed by Hangzhou Ruifeng Biotech Co.Ltd, and Zhejiang University, were also expected to receive the certificate.
