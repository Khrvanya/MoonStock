Cold and changeable weather in store this weekThis week is set to be cold, very unsettled and changeable with showers or longer spells of heavy rain and occasional frosts, according to Met Eireann.
Today (Monday, March 4) will start with frost, fog and snow lying in places at first. Sunny spells will later prevail in eastern areas early this morning, but occasional heavy rain and hail showers in western counties will become widespread during the morning.
There will be some continued falls of snow on higher ground of the west and north of the country with isolated thunderstorms.
Highest temperatures today will range from 4deg to 8deg, with moderate to fresh west to south-west winds.
Tonight will be breezy with further showers mainly in Connacht, Ulster and north Leinster, where they may merge to give some longer spells of rain at times and some wintry falls on higher ground.
Showers will be well scattered in more southern counties. Overnight, lowest temperatures will range from 1deg to 4deg with some frost in places.
