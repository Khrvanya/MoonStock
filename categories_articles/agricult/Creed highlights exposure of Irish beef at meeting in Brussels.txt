Creed highlights exposure of Irish beef at meeting in BrusselsThe exposure of the Irish beef sector has been highlighted by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Michael Creed, at a Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in Brussels yesterday (Monday, March 18).
Minister Creed said: "Yesterday's meeting was an important opportunity to highlight to the council, the commission and to my fellow ministers, the impacts of a no-deal Brexit on the agri-food sector in Ireland and the potential knock-on effects across the EU market as a whole."
The minister outlined the EU's targeted support for farmers available under the Common Market Organisation and said that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, "the full suite of measures should be deployed rapidly".
He also referred to the need to protect the EU beef sector in trade discussions with Mercosur, against the background of the significant uncertainty arising from Brexit.
While in Brussels, Minister Creed also held bilateral meetings with three other European leaders.
