Dairy tour 2 farmers with 2 very different stories to share…The dairy tour at this weekend's Macra Annual Conference is sure to be an insightful day out for anyone with a keen interest in dairy farming or with the dream of setting up a dairy enterprise in the future.
First on the agenda is a visit to Mike Dunne's farm, a dairy farmer based outside Kilworth, Co. Cork.
Mike runs a dairy farm in partnership with his father, Tom, and his uncle, Michael. Their herd consists of 370 Norwegian Red and Holstein-Friesian cows with the ambition to milk a full pedigree herd of Norwegian Reds in the future.
AgriLand's technical dairy journalist, Emma Gilsenan, visited Mike's farm this week and like attendees to the tour was keen to find out why they decided to move over to the Norwegian Red breed and how he finds milking through his impressive 60-unit DeLaval rotary parlour.

Having grown the business over the years, it will be interesting to find out what the future holds for the farm or whether they have reached their cut-off point.
While on Mike's farm, the visitors will hear from Ed Moakley, a dairy farmer and a dairy advisor working with Teagasc.
Ed is a new dairy entrant who recently converted a greenfield site where he is currently milking 40 cows through a VMS DeLaval robot - with the plan to work towards 60 cows in the future.
