Dale Farm and ABP Horizon Dairy Beef Partnership Everything you need to knowTwo of Northern Ireland's major agri-food businesses, Dale Farm and ABP, have announced the Horizon Dairy Beef Partnership.
'Horizon' is the first collaborative scheme of its kind in Northern Ireland, which will provide a market for selectively-bred, Aberdeen Angus, dairy-origin calves from Dale Farm dairy suppliers through the ABP supply chain.
We saw a somewhat similar programme rolled out in April 2019, where Kepak and Glanbia joined forces to introduce the Twenty20 Beef Club.
The partnership aims to provide full traceability from calf-to-carcass, and will provide inputs and technical advice - from United Feeds, Genus ABS NI and AI Services (Northern Ireland) Ltd. - to support animal welfare and production efficiency.
According to Dale farm and ABP, the scheme was developed to create:

Incremental income to farms;
Higher-quality animals for the beef industry that are fit for purpose;
An outlet for dairy-beef calves;
A reduction in the carbon footprint across farms;
Better production efficiencies;
Better growth rates;
Improved feed conversion;
Enhanced animal welfare;
Better feeding and grassland management.'Horizon' is the first collaborative scheme of its kind in Northern Ireland, which will provide a market for selectively-bred, Aberdeen Angus, dairy-origin calves from Dale Farm dairy suppliers through the ABP supply chain.
