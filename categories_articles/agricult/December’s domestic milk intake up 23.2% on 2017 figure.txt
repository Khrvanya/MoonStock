The only figure to see a positive monthly change was the imported milk intake, which rose from 64.4 million litres to 66.8 million litres across the two months.
Intervention stocks
The CSO's figures come a week after it was revealed that 99% of the European Union's intervention stocks of skimmed milk powder (SMP) have been sold back into the market.
According to Phil Hogan, European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, 376,000t of intervention SMP has been sold, out of the 380,000t brought in over the last three years.
According to the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, the selling out of intervention stock will lead to an increase in milk prices.
This, according to the association's dairy committee chairman Ger Quain, is a result of the overall tightening in milk supply across Europe.
