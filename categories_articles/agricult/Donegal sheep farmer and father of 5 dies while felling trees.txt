Kevin is survived by his partner and his five children.
According to Sinn Fein county councillor Albert Doherty, Kevin's parents had both recently died, and he "was making a valiant effort to put things right on the farm".
The local Inishowen Agricultural Show paid tribute to Kevin on social media, saying: "On behalf of the committee of the Inishowen Agricultural Show, we would like to express our sincerest condolences to the family of the late Kevin McElhinney.

The show concluded by saying: "Kevin, you will be sorely missed by everyone who knew you."
This is the second farm-related death in the country in less than a week.
On Wednesday, January 9, a man in Ballindine, Co. Mayo was killed after he was hit by part of a shed that was being demolished.
That tragedy came just after the Health and Safety Authority released figures on work-place fatalities in 2018, which showed that, while farm deaths had decreased from 2017, they still made up 41% of all deaths in the work place for the year.
