Don’t get caught out by grass tetany this springIf it slips under the radar grass tetany/hypomagnesaemia can suddenly prove very costly to farmers. The transition period post-calving is when animals are most susceptible to metabolic disorders such as this.
In severe cases - just like any metabolic disorder - it can have adverse affects on an animal's future reproductive performance. Any disorder that might compromise an animal's performance should not be overlooked.
This year - more so than previous years - due to the exceptional growth rates over the winter; their is an abundance of heavy covers ready to be grazed across the country.
Grass tetany often occurs when cows are let out to graze lush, green, low-fibre pastures; so it is something to be conscious of over the coming months.
Additionally, application of potash before early spring grazing increases the chances a magnesium deficiency so this should be avoided if possible.
Symptoms
The symptoms of grass tetany can occur rapidly and mainly impact the animal's nervous system.
Symptoms include:
