Dublin tractor protesters fined and given penalty pointsSeveral protesters involved in last month's tractor demonstration in Dublin city have been issued with fines and penalty points for apparent traffic offences.
AgriLand understands that several fines have been issued at various times over the course of the last month, and that another "raft" of fines have been issued today, Tuesday, February 25.
One demonstrator told AgriLand that he had received a fine of EUR80, accompanied by three penalty points, under the charge of breaking a red light - a charge the individual denies.
Another demonstrator allegedly received a total of EUR160 in fines, and five penalty points for two different offences.
Speaking to AgriLand, one protester said that those individuals who had received fines and/or penalty points were angered over the development.
He argues that there was an arrangement in place with Gardai to allow the tractors to protest in Dublin city, whereby there would be no "follow-up".
