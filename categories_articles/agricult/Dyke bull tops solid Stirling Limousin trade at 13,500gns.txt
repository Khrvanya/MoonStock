Dyke bull tops solid Stirling Limousin trade at 13,500gnsA good commercial trade for Limousin bulls was led by the MacGregor's, Milton of Campsie, at Stirling on Monday, February 3, with a top price of 13,500gns for their Reserve Senior Champion, Dyke Olympian.
Taking him home were J. & A. Galloway, Lochlyoch Farm, Carmichael, Biggar, Lanark.

Capping a great day's trading, Dyke sold all their run of seven bulls to average an impressive PS7,455/head.
"It was overall a good show of bulls with strength in length, locomotion, loin and good tops," said Judge Robert McNee, Over Finlarg, Tealing, Dundee.
Very commercially minded and running an upland farm, the McNees hang all their own cattle - mostly through ABP Perth - so Robert was looking for easy-fleshing bulls with a bit of cover to get the maximum carcass return.
At home, the McNees run 100 Luing, 60 Limousin and 12 Simmental cows, alongside a flock of 900 Cheviot ewes.
The day's leading price, Dyke Olympian, is an April 2018-born son of the 12,000gns Goldies Lordoftherings, purchased when standing supreme champion at Stirling in February 2017.
The 13,500gns Dyke Olympian, described by the judge as "tall, long and very correct", is out of the milky, 15-year-old cow, Dyke Amazon.
Dyke Amazon has bred show calves to PS7,000 and is full sister to the 7,000gns Dyke Triumph. He carries a Beef Value of LM+53 placing him in the top 1% of the Limousin breed for growth and performance.
Other leading prices
Second leading price was the 10,000gns Reserve Junior Champion, Newhouse Oriental, when selling to Cloquhat Farms, Wester Cloquhat, Bridge of Cally, Blairgowrie.

This black-coated bull was consigned by Messrs R.M. Adam & Son, Newhouse of Glamis, Glamis, Forfar with the herd also enjoying a solid trade that saw their six bulls gross PS38,036.
Oriental was born in July 2018 and is by Westhall Jammy who sired the leading price at the corresponding fixture last year (Westhall Norris 11,500gns), and is out of Newhouse Lazykay.
Another with an exceptional Beef Value (LM+52), the judge described him as having tremendous length, top and depth of flesh.
Continuing the good run from Donald MacGregor's 50-cow Dyke herd were two bulls at the 9,000gns mark.
The first of these was the Supreme Champion, Dyke Outlaw, born in April 2018 and weighing 1,090kg.

He is sired by Netherhall Gilbert, purchased at Carlisle and a good breeder in the herd with sons to date averaging PS7,000. He is out of the Goldies Comet daughter, Dyke Jemma.
The judge liked Outlaw's size, overall correctness and balance of flesh and the bull heads now to JW Kay & Co, Gass, Straiton, Ayr.
Another at 9,000gns was the fifth prizewinner Dyke Ovation (LM+56) when selling to Messrs Renwick, Corsebank, Sanquhar, Dumfries.
