EPA chief says decision coming shortly on biofuel waiver court decision1 Min ReadMarch 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency expects to announce a decision "shortly" on how it will respond to a court decision questioning the legitimacy of its biofuel waiver program, Administrator Andrew Wheeler said on Wednesday. "We're still working on that with our attorneys at EPA as well as the attorneys at Department of Justice. The decision has to be made by next week so we will be announcing something shortly," he said during a congressional hearing. He said he hoped the announcement would "quell" the market for biofuel blending credits, called RINs. (Reporting by Stephanie Kelly)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
