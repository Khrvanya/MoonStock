The European Council has announced that it has agreed to an extension until May 22, 2019, provided the withdrawal agreement is approved by the House of Commons next week.

If the withdrawal agreement is not approved by the House of Commons next week, the European Council has agreed to an extension until April 12, 2019, and expects the UK to indicate a way forward before this date for consideration by the European Council.
In a statement on the matter, the European Council has reiterated that there can be no opening of the withdrawal agreement that was agreed between the EU and the UK in November 2018.
Any unilateral commitment, statement or other act should be compatible with the letter and the spirit of the withdrawal agreement, the council has said.
The European Council has called for work to be continued on preparedness and contingency at all levels for the consequences of the UK's withdrawal, taking into account all possible outcomes.
