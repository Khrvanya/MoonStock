EU support package available for Irish workers who lose their jobs post BrexitIrish workers affected by a no-deal scenario post-Brexit will benefit from new EU support under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) Brexit contingency measure, Midlands North West MEP Maria Walsh has confirmed.
The news follows a European Parliament vote on Monday, October 21, where MEPs supported the new measure under the EGF to support workers and self-employed people who are made redundant as a result of a 'no-deal' scenario - subject to certain conditions.
"Despite the fact that there is a deal in principle between the UK and the EU, there remains continued uncertainty in the UK regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement."
Walsh continued: "A 'no-deal' scenario on November 1, 2019, remains a possible - although undesirable - outcome.
"It is important that we support those who may lose their jobs as a result of a hard Brexit."

The Fine Gael MEP went on to say that because Ireland's economy is closely tied to the UK economy it is among the "most exposed EU countries" to a no-deal Brexit.
It has been estimated that up to 50,000 jobs could be lost in Ireland in the two to three years following a hard Brexit.
She added: "While the impact of a no-deal Brexit will be felt throughout the entire EU, I think it is clear that some regions and economic sectors will be affected more directly.
