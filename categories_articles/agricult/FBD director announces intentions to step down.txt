Mart safety paramount to reducing premiums
Earlier in the week, mart safety was top of the agenda for FBD at an Irish Co-operative Organisation Society (ICOS) bi-monthly mart managers' meeting in Co. Laois.
At the event, a number of FBD's top brass presented the firm's mart claims experience and challenges over the last five years in relation to mart claims to attending mart managers.
These included the company's chief commercial officer, John Cahalan, along with Stewart Gavin, FBD agri-underwriting manager and FBD risk manager Ciaran Roche.
The firm also communicated that, although in its infancy, 'Mart Lockdown' where implemented and enforced holds most potential to eliminate the accidents which have occurred with most frequency on mart premises.
Cahalan acknowledged the challenges facing marts but reaffirmed FBD's commitment to work with ICOS to reduce the frequency and severity of accidents occurring on their premises.
ICOS livestock and environmental services executive Ray Doyle expressed his confidence in Irish marts taking the required measures to "help to enhance overall health and safety while reducing cost, claim severity and the frequency of accidents".
