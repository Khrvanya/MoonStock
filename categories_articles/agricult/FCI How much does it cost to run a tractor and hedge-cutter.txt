FCI How much does it cost to run a tractor and hedge-cutterThe Association of Farm & Forestry Contractors in Ireland (FCI) has published an analysis of the costs involved in running a tractor and hedge-cutter.
The analysis features in the latest edition of the association's membership magazine - namely 'Wheels & Fields'.

In its preamble, the FCI urges contractors to "ensure that each individual enterprise [including hedge-cutting for hire] generates a profit".
It goes on to say that "charge-out rates must be based on all operating costs".
The analysis uses the example of a "modern 150hp tractor" and a "contractor-spec hedge-cutter with a 6m reach, joystick controls and full support brackets". It says that operating costs largely remain the same, irrespective of who or what the customer is - a farmer; a local authority; or a utility company such as ESB Networks.
Tractor costs
Focusing firstly on the tractor, the FCI asserts that a typical 150hp model will cost between EUR10 and EUR15 per clock-hour (suggesting that it would cost in excess of EUR30,000 to trade-in and replace such a tractor if it had 3,000 hours on its clock/odometer).
The analysis states: "Being generous, the tractor ownership cost that essentially covers depreciation comes to EUR10/hour."

For labour, the FCI asserts that to pay a hedge-cutter operator EUR500 into his/her hand would, in reality, cost the contractor close to EUR720/week (equating to EUR18/hour for a 40-hour week).
The analysis suggests that fuel usage (factoring in travelling to and from each job/contract) might amount to 7L/hour (equating to EUR4.90/hour based on a green diesel cost of EUR0.70/L).

Looking specifically at repair costs, the FCI says that these are "generally calculated at between 3% and 5% of the machine's buying price - spread across the season".
In the case of a EUR100,000 tractor, that amounts to (at least) EUR3,000/season or EUR3/hour (assuming a 1,000-hour annual workload out of which 11 weeks or 500 hours are allocated to hedge-cutting).
Insurance costs for a modern 150hp tractor are put at EUR1,500/year. Again, assuming a 1,000-hour annual workload (across all activities), this results in an hourly cost of EUR1.50/hour.
Combined, this results in the following tractor-related costs (40-hour week):

Tractor (capital) cost (EUR10/hour X 40 hours) - EUR400/week;
Labour cost (EUR18/hour gross X 40 hours) - EUR720/week (gross);
Fuel cost (7L/hour = EUR4.90/hour based on a cost of EUR0.70/L) - EUR196/week;
Repair cost (EUR3/hour X 40 hours) - EUR120/week;
Insurance cost (EUR1.50/hour X 40 hours) - EUR60/week;
Total tractor operating cost (EUR37.40/hour) - EUR1,496/week.The analysis features in the latest edition of the association's membership magazine - namely 'Wheels & Fields'.
