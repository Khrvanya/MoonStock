Opening the application facility back in January, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine Michael Creed outlined:
"The nitrates derogation provides farmers an opportunity to farm at higher stocking rates, subject to certain conditions designed to protect the environment and meet the requirements of the Nitrates Directive.
"The derogation is an important facility for more intensive farmers."
The online system is aimed at "simplifying the application process and assisting farmers to avoid penalties".
"Almost 7,000 intensively stocked farmers availed of the derogation in 2018," Minister Creed noted.
"These farmers engage in soil sampling, nutrient management planning and comply with an increased inspection regime in order to ensure they are farming to a high environmental standard."
