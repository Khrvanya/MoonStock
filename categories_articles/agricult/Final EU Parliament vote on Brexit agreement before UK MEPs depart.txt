The vote in parliament's plenary session at 6:00pm comes after the completion of the ratification process in the UK and the positive recommendation adopted by the Constitutional Affairs Committee last week.
To enter into force, the withdrawal agreement between the EU and the UK needs to be approved by the European Parliament by a simple majority of votes cast before being subject to a final vote by qualified majority in the European Council.
The move will see the UK depart from the EU this Friday, January 31, at 11:00pm. A transition period will be in place until December 31, 2020.
After the vote, European Parliament President Sassoli will make a statement to the plenary, following which UK MEPs and group leaders will be invited to mark this moment in a short ceremony in the Yehudi Menuhin area at around 6:15pm.
