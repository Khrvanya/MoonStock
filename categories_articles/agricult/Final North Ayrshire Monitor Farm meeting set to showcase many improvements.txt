Final North Ayrshire Monitor Farm meeting set to showcase many improvementsThe final North Ayrshire Monitor Farm meeting is to be held at Girtridge Farm, Dundonald on Friday, February 28.
The meeting will provide a valuable opportunity for the local farming community to hear about the impact of changes implemented over the three-year programme.
The 140ha enterprise, Girtridge Farm, run by John Howie in partnership with his mother and sister, has benefited from many changes made during the programme.
These changes include: the introduction of rotational grazing; modifying their cattle finishing system; and increasing their sheep flock from 135 head to 500 head.
'Maximising every acre'
Commenting on the potential and experiences gained from the project, Howie said: "The monitor farm project has really opened our eyes to the true potential of our farm. We have been able to focus on maximising every acre in terms of efficiency and profitability.
"The expertise we have been able to tap into has given us the confidence to go ahead and try new things.
Through improved grazing and grassland management, we have been able to finish stock quicker and reduce feed costs; as a result, our business is in a much better position than when we started the project three years ago.
Raymond Crerar, North Ayrshire monitor farm facilitator from Scotland Agricultural College (SAC) Consulting, said of the project: "There has been tremendous support from the community group whose enthusiasm and innovative ideas have driven the success of this project at Girtridge."
