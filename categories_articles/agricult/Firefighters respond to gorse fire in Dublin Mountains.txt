Firefighters respond to gorse fire in Dublin MountainsIt may be only February, but dry weather always presents an increased possibility of gorse fires, warns Dublin Fire Brigade.
Firefighters from Rathfarnham, Tallaght and Dolphin's Barn stations attended an ongoing gorse fire in the Dublin Mountains last night (Monday, February 25).
According to a tweet on the Dublin Fire Brigade's Twitter page, no injuries or property damage has been reported; however, some cars in the area were reported to have been covered in ash today.
The fire occurred off Military Road near Glencullen above a view point in the mountains; varying numbers of fire engines were present at the scene while personnel tried to control the situation.
Firefighters have been tackling the blaze over the course of the last two days.

On its Twitter page, Dublin Fire Brigade said "dry weather means dry vegetation", suggesting that the unseasonably dry conditions may have exasperated whatever sparked the flames originally.
"Believe it or not, not a lot of rain recently, leading to dry vegetation. Take care with flammable materials if you're out for a walk today," said another tweet.
