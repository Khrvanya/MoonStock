First Irish outing for Dammann at FTMTA Farm Machinery ShowThe Farm Tractor & Machinery Trade Association (FTMTA) has informed AgriLand that a German-built Dammann self-propelled sprayer will make its Irish debut at next week's FTMTA Farm Machinery Show.
Chantry Dammann UK Ltd is the UK distributor for the German manufacturer that produces the machine. The newly-appointed Irish dealer is Clarkill Farming (Clarkill, Borrisokane, Co. Tipperary).
The machine that will be on display in Punchestown - a DT 2800H S4 EcoDrive (pictured above) - has apparently been sold here. After next week's event, it will make its way to its new owner - Kehoe Farming (Ballybrack, Foulksmills, Co. Wexford).
The machine will likely prove to be one of the many talking points at the show.
Herbert Dammann GmbH - to use the manufacturer's full trading name - doesn't just build agricultural sprayers. It also makes specialised bowsers/sprayers for municipal and airport use.

It even builds spraying systems for use on railway lines. The company is based near Hamburg in the northern reaches of Germany.
It's worth noting that next week's show kicks off on Thursday (February 7) and runs until Saturday (February 9). Trucks and low-loaders are currently making their way to Co. Kildare - to transport the hoards of machines that will be on display.
Map and exhibitor list
In the meanwhile, the FTMTA has produced a detailed map of the show, showing the overall layout of the event and, more specifically, the location of the various exhibitors.

Map: Find your way around the FTMTA Farm Machinery Show 



Herbert Dammann GmbH - to use the manufacturer's full trading name - doesn't just build agricultural sprayers. It also makes specialised bowsers/sprayers for municipal and airport use.

It even builds spraying systems for use on railway lines. The company is based near Hamburg in the northern reaches of Germany.
It's worth noting that next week's show kicks off on Thursday (February 7) and runs until Saturday (February 9). Trucks and low-loaders are currently making their way to Co. Kildare - to transport the hoards of machines that will be on display.
Map and exhibitor list
In the meanwhile, the FTMTA has produced a detailed map of the show, showing the overall layout of the event and, more specifically, the location of the various exhibitors.
