First aid courses for Northern Ireland farm families launchedA new series of free workshops could have the potential to save lives on Northern Ireland farms.
It comes as statistics from the region's Farm Safety Partnership show that as many as 100 NI farm accidents each month require medical attention.
To-date, over 1,700 farm family members have attended CAFRE's Farm Family First Aid Awareness programmes.
The hands-on training, run as part of the Farm Family Key Skills (FFKS) Scheme, discusses how to deal with a wide range of first aid emergencies encountered on farms.
The sessions aim to provide farm family members and employees with the skills they need to deal with emergency situations confidently, promptly and safely.
Participants will also receive a complimentary first aid kit with training on its contents and their use to treat minor injuries.
The Farm Family First Aid Awareness courses for November and December will take place on the following dates:
