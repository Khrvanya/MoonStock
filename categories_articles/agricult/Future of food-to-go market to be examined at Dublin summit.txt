Future of food-to-go market to be examined at Dublin summitAn international conference and trade show, being hosted in association with Kepak, is set to examine the future of the food-to-go market.
Taking place in the Round Room at Dublin's Mansion House on May 21, 2019, the Food-To-Go Summit will gather together a panel of speakers, retailers and industry specialists.
The all-day conference will also include an exhibitors' hall where suppliers can showcase some of their "most exciting" ideas, innovative concepts and trending products in the food-to-go space.
The total size of the food-to-go sector on the island of Ireland in 2018 was EUR458 million in terms of consumer spending and EUR160 million in operator purchases, according to Bord Bia research.
The research also revealed that the 2019-2022 forecasted growth for consumer spending in the sector is expected to be 5.2%.
Commenting on the Food-To-Go Summit, marketing director for foodservice at Kepak, Blathnaid Ni Fhatharta, said: "The Food-To-Go Summit is an unmissable opportunity for anyone operating in the food-to-go space.
Whether you're a convenience store manager, forecourt retailer, deli operator, category manager or buyer, the Food-To-Go Summit is a unique opportunity to get several steps ahead in the incredibly competitive landscape that is food-to-go.
"The summit will provide an up-close view of the opportunities that are there to be grasped by forward-looking players in the market, while attendees will be inspired by industry experts, best-in-class operators and innovative suppliers with insights on how to grow their food-to-go offering in terms of scale, innovation and profitability."
