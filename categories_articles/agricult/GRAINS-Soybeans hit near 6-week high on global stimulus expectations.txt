GRAINS-Soybeans hit near 6-week high on global stimulus expectations2 Min ReadSYDNEY, March 3 (Reuters) - U.S. soybean futures rose to a near six-week high on Tuesday, boosted by expectations for coordinated global stimulus steps to offset the broad economic impact of the coronavirus. * The most active soybean futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade were up 0.1% at $9.01-1/2 a bushel by 0152 GMT after hitting a high of $9.05-1/2. Soybeans firmed 0.9% on Monday. * The most active corn futures were up 0.5% at $3.76-1/2 a bushel, having gained 2% in the previous session. * The most active wheat futures were down 0.2% at $5.22 a bushel, having closed down 0.3% on Monday. * Market sentiment got a boost from expectations that central banks worldwide will cut interest rates to soften the blow of the coronavirus. * The U.S. Department of Agriculture said 670,608 tonnes of U.S. soybeans were inspected for export in the week ended Feb. 27, within analysts' estimates. * U.S. wheat export inspections of 654,097 tonnes topped expectations, while corn inspections of 896,221 tonnes were within expectations. * Argentina's ministry of agriculture said last week it was suspending the registration of agricultural exports until further notice.
