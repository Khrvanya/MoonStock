Gearing up for grazing What should I doEvery blade of grass that an animal eats represents a saving on winter feed costs and will have a positive impact on its liveweight gain. Grazed grass is the cheapest feed and suckler beef farmers must maximise the length of the grazing system.
Speaking at a beef event in Co. Kilkenny on Tuesday night (January 15), Teagasc's Catherine Egain explained the importance of grass in beef animals' diets.
"Grass is five times cheaper than meal and three times cheaper than silage; the aim is to reduce the housing period as much as possible.
"At the minute, the national average days at grass is 220 days, but we need to target this to 280-300 days weather depending and land type," she explained.
Catherine also highlighted that for every additional tonne of grass eaten per hectare, profits on beef farms will increase by EUR105/ha.
This EUR105 profit is achieved by: increasing the amount of grass utilised; increasing the number of grazings that are achieved; and increasing the amount of nitrogen (N) that is efficiently utilised on the farm. 
In addition, the national average beef farmer is grazing each paddock five times/year. However, the target is 10t of dry matter (DM)/ha and 10 grazings/paddock. There is huge scope to increase the number of grazings per paddock on beef farms, Catherine said.
