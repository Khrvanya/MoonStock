German farmers take to roads in extensive tractor protestsGerman farmers are the latest primary producers to take to the roads in protest in a number of locations around Germany today, Tuesday, October 22.
The rally, which is being organised by the group "Land Schafft Verbindung" ("Land Creates Connection"), is protesting, according to the group, against "the current environmental and agricultural policy, the economic power and social peace that is endangered in rural areas in Germany".
The group is planning an event today from 11:00am; a main event kicked off in Bonn, in the west of the country. However, a number of other tractor protests are taking place on other major city routes.
According to the group, hundreds of tractors, buses and cars will be used to "show what we think about current politics".
