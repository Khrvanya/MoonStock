Give your replacement heifers the best start Here’s how…This year's calves will be your future milk producers of your herd; so it is paramount that they get the best start in life.
For this to happen; they must be kept on a high plain of nutrition from birth to weaning. Before turn-out, a mixture of whole milk or milk replacer, concentrates and hay/straw should be fed. They should also have access to fresh, clean water daily.
Introducing concentrates
It is vital for rumen development that a calf is offered a source of concentrates from three to five days-of-age. Although, they will only eat a very minimal amount up until about three to four weeks-of-age.
It is best practice to offer a small fresh amount of concentrates each day - to encourage consumption - as it can be difficult to get young calves to eat concentrates that have been sitting in the feeder for more than one day. This is also useful to avoid wastage.
The importance of feeding concentrates:
