The Milk Supplier Trading Bonus will be paid to qualifying members with their January milk payment and is based on 2018 milk supply volumes.
A total of 3,755 Glanbia Co-op members will receive an average Milk Supplier Trading Bonus of EUR2,850.

In the coming weeks a further EUR3 million in trading bonus payments will be paid to members with the distribution of the Grain Supplier Trading Bonus and the Feed Trading Bonus.
The Trading Bonus Scheme is funded from Glanbia Co-op's 60% share of the dividend paid by Glanbia Ireland to its shareholders - Glanbia Co-op and Glanbia Plc.
Commenting on this, Martin Keane, chairman of Glanbia Co-operative Society, said that the trading bonus rewards Glanbia Co-op members for trading with the business that the co-operative majority owns - Glanbia Ireland.
"It is an equitable and transparent means of returning a share of Glanbia Ireland's profit to active farmers."
