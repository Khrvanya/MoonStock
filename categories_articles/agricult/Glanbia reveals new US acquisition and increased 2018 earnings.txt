"We continue to invest in expanding our business and its capabilities and we completed the acquisition of SlimFast in November 2018.
"Today, I am happy to announce that we have agreed to acquire Watson for $89 million. Watson is a non-dairy ingredient solutions business headquartered in Connecticut in the US.
"It is a highly complementary addition to our Nutritional Solutions business and will help broaden our capabilities in the ingredients sector.
The outlook for 2019 is positive and Glanbia expects to deliver 5% to 8% growth in adjusted earnings per share, constant currency.
"If the Euro : US Dollar exchange rate remains at current levels, the reported 2019 result will be 3% higher than the constant currency outlook," Talbot concluded.
