Grain price Global supply looks good for future pricesWhile wheat markets have shown increases over the past number of weeks it is important to proceed with caution when deciding on grain sales as global grain supply still looks to be plentiful.
Current increases are most likely being driven by the demand in the Black Sea region, as well as the effect of drought on the wheat crop in Argentina. The Argentinian wheat crop is estimate down 300,000t to 18.5 million tonnes.
