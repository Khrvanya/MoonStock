Grain price LIFFE wheat drops amid Brexit vote; MATIF holds firmOn Wednesday, the LIFFE wheat price for January dropped below PS170.00/t for the first time since November 30.
That drop on Wednesday (January 16), came the day after the crucial Brexit vote in the UK parliament on Tuesday (January 15).
The reason for the drop can largely be attributed to currency movements. The value of the pound (against the euro) rose significantly from the middle of last week and on Friday (January 18) morning stood at PS1=EUR1.13. This makes UK products more expensive in the 'eurozone' and, as a result, wheat price has dropped.

LIFFE wheat opened the week at PS171.30/t (January 14) and dropped steadily throughout, hitting PS170.55/t on Tuesday (January 15), before dropping to PS169.30/t on Wednesday (January 16).
