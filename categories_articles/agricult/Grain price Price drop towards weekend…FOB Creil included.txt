Grain price Price drop towards weekend…FOB Creil includedGrain markets all took a hit this week. The FOB (Free On Board) Creil price, which Boortmalt suppliers have heard so much about in recent days, was no different. It finished the week at EUR185.00/t (July, 2019).
USDA supply and demand estimates
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Supply and Demand Estimates were published last week (February 8) following the absence of a report in January amid the Federal Government shutdown.
The report stated that world wheat production for the 2018/2019 market year is raised by 1.3 million tonnes. This is mainly due to increases in Russia, Brazil and Paraguay.
Global exports of wheat are also raised by 1.3 million tonnes. Pakistan led this trend with an increase of 0.7 million tonnes. Russian exports increased by 0.5 million tonnes, while Paraguay's exports increased by 0.4 million tonnes.
Exports are down from Australia and Argentina by 0.5 million tonnes and 0.2 million tonnes respectively.
Global wheat use in 2018/2019 is up by two million tonnes.
Global use is rising faster than supplies and as a result world ending stocks are down by 0.6 million tonnes to 267.5 million tonnes.
