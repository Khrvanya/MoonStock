Grain price WASDE report doesn’t make huge impactGrain prices dropped this week, having recovered slightly in the week previous.
The publication of the WASDE (World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates) report certainly didn't add any bullish sentiments to the market. The EU's large export increase describes in some way the competition in the market, while corn production and consumption are estimated up.
As corn production rises it will no doubt have some bearing on grain prices at home. As always there are numerous factors affecting prices and a large spring barley crop in Europe will not be the only thing weighing in on price.
