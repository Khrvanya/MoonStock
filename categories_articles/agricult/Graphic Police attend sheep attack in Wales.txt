Graphic Police attend sheep attack in WalesSeveral sheep have been killed - and several more injured - after being attacked in south-west Wales sometime between Sunday and Tuesday.
The incident, which took place at Honeyborough in Neyland, Pembrokeshire, was attended by members of the Rural Crime Team of Dyfed-Powys Police.

Taking to Twitter to call for further information, the Police explained that the incident occurred some time between 8:00am last Sunday, August 18, and 8:00am on Tuesday last, August 20.
"DP Rural Policing attended to livestock attack at Honeyborough, Neyland... Several sheep killed and several treated for injuries," police wrote on Twitter.

The RCT called for anyone with information to report it by calling 101. The police did not say what or who was responsible for the attack.
2-tractor collision
The Dyfed-Powys Rural Crime Team was also busy a short distance away when two tractors collided on a road.
It appears both tractors were pulling silage trailers, at least one of which was carrying a load.
This incident took place at Llanychaer, near Fishguard, also in Pembrokeshire. As can be seen by the below pictures, the tractors seem to have been extensively damaged.

Thankfully though, the drivers were not seriously injured in the accident, which occurred at around 4:45pm last Tuesday, August 20.
The incident resulted in the road where the accident happened being closed for over six hours. It was not reopened until approximately 11:00pm that night.
