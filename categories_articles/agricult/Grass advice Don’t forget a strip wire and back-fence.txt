Grass advice Don’t forget a strip wire and back-fenceAs it stands, average farm covers are standing in or around 950kg/DM/ha on farms measuring grass through PastureBase Ireland and the attention - if not already done so - should be getting grass into the diet where possible.
The best way to do this is to walk the entire farm and put a plan in place through the form of a spring rotation planner.
According to Teagasc, getting 30% of the platform grazed in February will be difficult with the large quantity of grass available on farms; this will also be dependent on stocking rate and soil type.

Light or early farms, Teagasc says, should target to have 30% of the farm grazed by February 28 and 65% by March 17. These farms should aim to start their second rotation in early April.

According to Teagasc, heavy or very late farms need to aim to have 30% of the farm grazed by mid-March and 65% grazed by April 1; the start of the second rotation should begin mid-April.
When it comes to managing grass this week, Teagasc offers the following advice:

Graze low covers first (600-1,000kg/ha/day) - livestock will graze a larger area/day in lower covers;
Minimise meal feeding and silage feeding if possible - this will increase livestock's grass intake;
Use a strip wire and back-fence, so that grazed areas can recover for the second rotation;
Turn out yearlings on the grazing platform in early February;
If conditions are wet, make an effort to let cattle out by day.The best way to do this is to walk the entire farm and put a plan in place through the form of a spring rotation planner.
