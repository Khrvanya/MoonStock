Growth in families purchasing lamb as consumer trends shift in 2019UK lamb consumer trends in 2019 show that the total spend on the commodity at retail has been relatively stable, based on new figures from Kantar Worldpanel.
The volume of lamb purchased in the UK decreased by 1.7% on 2018 levels - to stand at 61,200t.
The volume sales of lamb varied between each category, with lamb mince seeing the biggest increase - up 4.9% on 2018.
This is aligned with an increased demand from the consumer for more convenience-based lamb products and a shift to include more lamb mid-week, in addition to the traditional 'Sunday roast'.
This uplift in mince volume sales for the year occurred despite an increase of 17p/kg in the average price.
The lamb leg roasting joints accounted for the highest share of the spend at 38.2% (up 1.8% on the previous year), while the proportion of spend on lamb mince increased by 7.4% on 2018 to a total PS50.9 million.

"If we look at household demographics, the data suggests that over 45's and those without children account for a high proportion of lamb sales," commented Glesni Phillips, data analyst at Hybu Cig Cymru (HCC) - Meat Promotion Wales.
Chops and steaks are still strong performers, contributing to just over 29% of spend on lamb during 2019.
"We're also seeing growth in families purchasing lamb mince which is important for future long-term engagement with lamb.
