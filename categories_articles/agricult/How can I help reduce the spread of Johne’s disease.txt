How can I help reduce the spread of Johne’s diseaseJohne's disease is a bacterial disease of cattle, which can have a negative economic impact on farms. With calving gathering speed, it's important to keep the necessary steps in mind to limit the spread of this costly disease.
According to Animal Health Ireland (AHI), infection normally occurs when young calves drink colostrum and milk or eat feed contaminated with the bacteria known for causing the disease.
Phase two of the Irish Johne's Control Programme (IJCP) commenced on Tuesday last, January 1. Registration for this phase is now open. However, only activities carried out after January 1, 2019 are eligible for payment as part of phase two of the programme.
Calves are the most susceptible animals on a farm to the disease for which there is no cure and even a very small amount of dung on a dirty udder can contain enough bacteria to infect a suckling calf. On occasion, calves are already infected at birth and this is common when their dam has advanced disease.
Signs of Johne's disease:

Reduced production, lower milk yields and lower feed conversion efficiency;
Weight loss, despite a good appetite;
Scour (not bloody) and ultimately emaciation;
Soft swelling of the jaw or brisket;
Death.According to Animal Health Ireland (AHI), infection normally occurs when young calves drink colostrum and milk or eat feed contaminated with the bacteria known for causing the disease.
