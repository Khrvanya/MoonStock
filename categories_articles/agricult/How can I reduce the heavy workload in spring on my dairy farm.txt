How can I reduce the heavy workload in spring on my dairy farmWith the expanding dairy herd, the labour associated with calving a large number of cows over a short period of time is fast approaching for many dairy farmers.
Who could forget the workload on dairy farms last year, as storms and snow played havoc with the day-to-day running of farms. However, if current weather conditions remain, life will be that little bit easier during this busy period.
Saying that, with the push for efficiency, many farmers have targeted calving 90% of their cows in just six weeks. Alongside this comes the pressures of milking for the first time in 2019 and - hopefully - pushing to get cows out to grass.
However, there are a number of ways that dairy farmers can use to relieve some of the pressures at this difficult time of the year.
These include: feeding silage at night; once-a-day calf feeding; the outdoor rearing of calves; once-a-day milking in early lactation; and shortening the milking interval.
Feeding silage at night
Research from Teagasc Moorepark has shown that restricting silage feeding time during the day resulted in less night calvings, compared to allowing cows full daily access.

According to Teagasc, this practice reduced the number of cows calving between 12:00am-06:00am from 25% to 10-15%.
To limit feeding time:

Allow adequate silage feeding space (0.6m/cow);
Put silage at the feed barrier during the day (avoids machinery work at night);
Use lockable headgates (where available) to keep cows back from silage and open at the designated time in the evening.Who could forget the workload on dairy farms last year, as storms and snow played havoc with the day-to-day running of farms.
