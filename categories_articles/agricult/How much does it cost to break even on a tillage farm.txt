How much does it cost to break even on a tillage farmIt might sound simple, in order to make a profit you need to keep costs to a minimum and increase yields. The reality is more difficult. Results from the recent Teagasc E-Profit Monitor for tillage showed average break-even costs, at average yields, across a total of 342 farms which inputted data to the programme.
The break-even costs are reported in EUR/t and are calculated from average yields and average crop sales (excluding income from straw).
Average crop yields:

Winter wheat - 10.6t/ha;
Winter barley - 9.3t/ha;
Spring feed barley - 7.8t/ha;
Spring malting barley - 7.8t/ha;
Spring wheat - 8.2t/ha;
Winter oats - 8.2t/ha;
Spring oats - 8.0t/ha;
Winter oilseed rape - 4.7t/ha;
Spring oilseed rape - 2.5t/ha;
Spring beans - 6.9t/ha;
Fodder beet - 78.5t/ha.The break-even costs are reported in EUR/t and are calculated from average yields and average crop sales (excluding income from straw).
