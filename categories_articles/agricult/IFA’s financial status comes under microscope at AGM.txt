He went on to say the organisation's Diversity Committee would be coming back this year with recommendations that "will challenge us".
"That is how it should be; the scale of work IFA undertakes could not be done without the commitment and dedication of farmers at all levels of the organisation; I want to recognise, in particular, those officers on council who are completing their terms. I want to thank you sincerely for your leadership, dedication and hard work. It is easy to talk the talk, but you have walked the walk."
