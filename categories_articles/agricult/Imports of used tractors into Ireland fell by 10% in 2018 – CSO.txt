Imports of used tractors into Ireland fell by 10% in 2018 – CSOImports of used (second-hand) tractors fell last year (2018), when compared with 2017. That's according to figures released by the CSO (Central Statistics Office).
2,198 imported (used) tractors were licensed (for road use) in 2018. That's 10.4% down on the figure for 2017 (2,453). Interestingly, the 2017 figure was up substantially on the tally for 2016 (1,908).
It should be noted, however, that the CSO's figures count used (second-hand) tractors licensed for the first time in the relevant taxation class (i.e. taxed for use on the public road as an agricultural tractor).
In other words, a vehicle is licensed when a valid motor tax disc is issued for the first time.

That is not the same as vehicle registration; a vehicle is registered when it gets its licence plate (registration number) for the first time.
This table (below), from the CSO, shows the figures in greater detail.

Releases from the CSO titled 'Vehicles Licensed for the First Time' commenced in 1993. These replaced the previous 'Particulars of Vehicles Registered and Licensed for the First Time'.
Interestingly, in 1993, separate systems for vehicle registration and licensing were phased in. The Office of the Revenue Commissioners became responsible for the compilation of vehicle registrations, while the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government retained responsibility for vehicle licensing.
In 2008, responsibility for vehicle licensing was transferred to the Department of Transport (which later became the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport).
It produces vehicle licensing statistics on a monthly and annual basis. Vehicle registration data has not been published on the CSO StatBank since 2010.
The CSO points out that, where applicable, the "licensing process follows the registration process".

According to the CSO, vehicle registration and licensing figures can differ for a number of reasons.
For example, there may be a delay between registration and first licensing. Or, alternatively, some vehicles which are not used in a public place may not need to be licensed at all.
