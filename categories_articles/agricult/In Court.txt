  In courtRegulating GM paddy:  The Supreme Court has issued notices to the ministry of agriculture, department of biotechnology under ministry 
of science and technology and the environment ministry to clear their stand on the regulatory process for approval of genetically modified (GM) 
crops (see 'Test tube brinjal',  Down To Earth, April 1-15, 2009). The court sought clarification based on an application filed by Gene 
Campaign, a non-profit, which alleged that GM trials of paddy in Jharkhand by biotech company Mahyco were illegal and violated all biosafety 
norms. The court asked Mahyco to respond. The petition, filed in October 2008, demanded a review by the Genetic Engineering Approval 
Committee of permission to conduct field trials and the commercialization of GM crops. The next hearing is on April 29.  We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.
