Indonesia's 2019 white sugar output climbs, but misses target1 Min ReadJAKARTA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - * Indonesia's white sugar output in 2019 stood at 2.23 million tonnes, up 3% from 2018, Kasdi Subagyono, the director general of plantations at the agriculture ministry,  told reporters on Friday. * Last year's white sugar output of 2.23 million tonnes increased from 2.17 million tonnes in 2018, but missed a target of 2.45 million tonnes. * In 2019, Indonesia imported 495,000 tonnes of white sugar, down from 1.1 million a year earlier, Subagyono said. * "Hopefully, we don't need to import for household consumption (this year), because we want to increase production," he said. * White sugar production in 2020 is expected to come in at 2.46 million tonnes, Agriculture Minister Syahrul Yasin Limpo had said in November.
