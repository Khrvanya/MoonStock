Kerry holds milk price for January suppliesKerry Group has decided to hold its milk price for January supplies, the processor has announced.
A spokesperson for the group confirmed to AgriLand that the firm's base price for January milk supplies remains unchanged at 32c/L VAT inclusive.
Based on average January milk solids, the price return inclusive of VAT and bonuses is 36.229c/L, the representative added.
This follows on from an unchanged milk price announced by both Lakeland and Glanbia in recent days.
Yesterday, following a meeting of the co-operative, Lakeland announced that it has held its milk price and will pay 32.06c/L, including VAT and lactose bonus, for January milk supplies.
While global dairy market conditions have remained relatively stable since December, and through January, this is coming from a lower base in the latter half of 2018.
