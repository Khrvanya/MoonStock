Lakeland announces December price – with bonusLakeland Dairies has become the first milk processor to announce its price for December, with the board of the co-op meeting to decide a figure today (Friday, January 11).
Lakeland Dairies has held its milk price and will pay 32.06c/L, inclusive of VAT and lactose bonus, for December milk supplies. This is the same as the price paid for November milk supplies.
Lakeland Dairies will also pay an extra 5c/L Voluntary December Bonus to qualifying suppliers, based on peak to trough supply ratios.
In Northern Ireland, Lakeland Dairies has held its milk price at 26.5p/L plus an out of season bonus of 3p/L for December milk supplies.
Year to date, milk supplies have remained strong and were up by 17% in December compared to the same time a year ago, according to a spokesperson for Lakeland Dairies.
While global markets continue to be volatile, the ongoing EU sale of stocks from intervention provides a reasonable level of stability at the start of the year. However, butter prices declined significantly in recent months.
Lakeland Dairies will continue to pay the highest possible milk price in line with market conditions, the representative added.

Ornua has confirmed that its Purchase Price Index (PPI) figure for the month of December 2018 rose to 107.5, an increase of over two points.
The figure for the previous month, November 2018, was 104.9, which was a drop from the previous value.
