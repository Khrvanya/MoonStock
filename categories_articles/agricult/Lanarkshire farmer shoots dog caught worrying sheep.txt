Reforming Scottish dog legislation
In July, a parliamentary committee that scrutinised Scotland's dog control laws, found the current legislation was not fit for purpose.
The Scottish Parliament's Public Accounts and Post Legislative Scrutiny Committee took an overarching look at all legislation on dogs.
The committee found that:

The current dog control law is not fit for purpose and it called on the Scottish Government to undertake a comprehensive review of all dog control legislation as a matter of urgency.
Current law is complex and not fit for purpose and should be consolidated.
The lack of implementation of a dog control notice (DCN) database must be rectified.
Data on out of control dogs and dog attacks should be specifically linked to the number of DCNs that have been issued and the resources available to each local authority.

National Farmers' Union Scotland has called for a full and comprehensive review of the legislation in light of the findings.
