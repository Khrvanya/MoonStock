Last call for NSA Next Generation conferencesThe National Sheep Association (NSA) is inviting enthusiastic young sheep farmers from across the UK to join them at this year's one-day Next Generation winter conferences.
The winter conference offers younger shepherds the chance to hear from NSA representatives as well as from some leading names in sheep research, health and nutrition.
The event also a series of informal, interactive workshops allowing attendees to gain a useful variation of information that can help them back on their own family farms or in their current or future careers.
In response to the increasing interest for more similar events, the NSA will this year hold two winter conferences for the first time.
The first conference will take place on Tuesday, November 5 at J24 Sedgemoor Auction Centre near Bridgwater, Somerset and the second on Thursday, November 7 at J36 Rural Auction centre, near Kendal, Cumbria. Both events aimed at those aged 16 to 35 are free to attend and will include a free lunch.

Helping to bring the conferences together, NSA communications officer Katie James said: "Through all NSA activity, one of the key things that emerges time and time again is the benefit of meeting like-minded people and sharing experiences, so we are pleased to be able to offer this to a larger audience this year at our two winter events.
