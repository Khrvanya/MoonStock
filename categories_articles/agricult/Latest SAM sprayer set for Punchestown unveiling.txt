Latest SAM sprayer set for Punchestown unveilingFurlong Equipment Services will launch the SAM range of self-propelled sprayers onto the Irish market at next week's Farm Tractor & Machinery Trade Association (FTMTA) Farm Machinery Show.
UK-based SAM (Sands Agricultural Machinery) produces a range of machines - with capacities of 3,000; 3,500; 4,000; 5,500; and 6,000L.
The manufacturer says that its 'Horizon' model can be "specified exactly to the customer's needs - from a comparatively simple unit to a full bells-and-whistles auto-steering machine with section control".

These sprayers are powered by Deutz engines - ranging from 180 to 242hp in the bigger-tanked models.
On the stand at next week's show will be a Horizon 5500 (with a 36m-wide boom).
Noel Furlong, of Furlong Equipment Services, explained: "These machines are very well suited to Irish conditions, with their permanent, hydrostatic 4WD."
As standard, Horizon models come with "intelligent" four-wheel steer; hydraulic suspension; 24m-wide booms (booms up to 40m are available); triplet nozzles; a clean water rinse tank; and a stainless steel induction hopper.

The cab comes with electric and heated mirrors; digital climate control; a rear-view camera; and an electric joystick.
SAM has been designing and building self-propelled crop sprayers since 1975. Furlong Equipment Services - its Irish agent - is based near Stradbally, Co. Laois.

Map: Find your way around the FTMTA Farm Machinery Show 




These sprayers are powered by Deutz engines - ranging from 180 to 242hp in the bigger-tanked models.
On the stand at next week's show will be a Horizon 5500 (with a 36m-wide boom).
Noel Furlong, of Furlong Equipment Services, explained: "These machines are very well suited to Irish conditions, with their permanent, hydrostatic 4WD."
As standard, Horizon models come with "intelligent" four-wheel steer; hydraulic suspension; 24m-wide booms (booms up to 40m are available); triplet nozzles; a clean water rinse tank; and a stainless steel induction hopper.

The cab comes with electric and heated mirrors; digital climate control; a rear-view camera; and an electric joystick.
SAM has been designing and building self-propelled crop sprayers since 1975. Furlong Equipment Services - its Irish agent - is based near Stradbally, Co. Laois.
