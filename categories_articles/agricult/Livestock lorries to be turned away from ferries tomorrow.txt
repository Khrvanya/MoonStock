Livestock lorries to be turned away from ferries tomorrowFerries bound for Cherbourg, France, will not bring livestock lorries with live exports aboard on sailings scheduled for tomorrow (Tuesday, March 11).
Both Irish Ferries and Stena Line confirmed to AgriLand that the boats will not bring livestock for health and safety reasons as Storm Gareth approaches.
A Stena Line representative also expressed concerns as to whether the sailing will be cancelled altogether due to the looming storm.
This will likely put further pressure on challenges facing exporters to get calves out of the country, with exporter concerns previously voiced of backlogs when both companies were forced to cancel livestock sailings earlier in the month.
