The world's second-largest producer and exporter of palm oil calculated a reference price of 2,907.63 ringgit per tonne for next month. Malaysia had set the export tax for January at 5%, raising it after placing a tax-free exemption on crude palm oil from May to December 2019 in a move to boost palm oil exports and expand into new markets.
