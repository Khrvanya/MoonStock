Malone to ‘level the playing field’ with new mid-mounted mowerMalone - the Mayo-based farm machinery manufacturer - will show one of its newly designed centre-pivot mowers at next week's National Ploughing Championships (September 17-19).
This new mower line-up complements the company's existing ranges (of trailed and mounted models).
The machine on display - a Malone Procut 3000 MP - is what the manufacturer describes as a "mid-mounted plain mower". Making its debut in Co. Carlow next week, it will be available for the 2020 season.

The Procut 3000 MP - as its model designation suggests - has a cutting width of 3m. Other versions (2.6m and 3.4m) are apparently "in the pipeline".
A spokesperson explained: "It has an innovative hydraulic floating (suspension) system - resulting in an exceptionally clean cut.

"This mower also has swath wheels - to leave the cut material in a tidy swath.
All of the hubs in the bed are protected by a shear system, so any shocks that do occur at ground level don't travel through the Walterscheid driveline to the central gearbox or the back-end of the tractor.
Each of the seven cutting discs is fitted with 4mm cranked blades. The bed itself can be accessed via a folding cover - to reset the shear mechanism or replace a blade.
The machine is also home to a friction-clutch and over-run protection.

To make the mower easier to attach to a tractor (often, says Malone, a challenge with mounted mowers), the company provides a tripod stand. It's used when parking up the machine.
