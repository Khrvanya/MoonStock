Malting growers will not accept offer of ˆ190t from BoortmaltMalting barley growers will not be signing up to any contract with Boortmalt until they are happy with a deal; that means when they are guaranteed a minimum payment of EUR200/t.
Growers were extremely frustrated that the only change to the proposed malting barley price deal with Boortmalt, from last week, is that historical transport allowances will be reinstated.
Members of the Irish Farmers' Association's (IFA's) malting barley committee stated that it understood negotiations were still open with Boortmalt leaving its meeting with the company last Wednesday (February 6). However, Boortmalt made a price offer to growers on Monday.
Divide and conquer
The committee were unclear at what was happening before its growers meeting tonight (Monday, February 11) when the company sent out contradicting text messages to growers.
Farmers expressed their confusion at the offer to growers today and outlined that it did not specify any premium payment for distilling barley.
