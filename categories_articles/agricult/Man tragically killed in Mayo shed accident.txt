Should this be classed as a work-related death, it will be the first farm-related fatality of 2019.
15 farm-related deaths in 2018
The news comes just days after the HSA released its statistics for work-place fatalities during 2018.
Figures released yesterday (Tuesday, January 8) show that 37 people were killed in work-related accidents in 2018, a decline of 23% on 2017.
The farming sector, which has consistently been the most dangerous sector in which to work, featured 15 work-related deaths last year compared to 25 in 2017, a decline of 40%.
CEO of the HSA, Dr. Sharon McGuinness noted that, with 15 fatalities - which represents 41% of total fatalities - farming had far too many for a sector that employs just 6% of the workforce.
