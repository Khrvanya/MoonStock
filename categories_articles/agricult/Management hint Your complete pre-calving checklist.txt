Management hint Your complete pre-calving checklistWith the calving season only around the corner, this 'downtime' between now and calving is a good opportunity for farmers to begin their preparations for the busy season ahead.
To ensure everything runs as smooth as possible and so that nothing is forgotten, we have compiled a number of things which farmers should soon begin getting ticked off their to-do list.
1. Housing facilities
The calf rearing and calving area should be cleaned out and disinfected well in advance of calving.
This, Teagasc says, allows them time to dry out and helps to break down any carry over of infection from one year to the next.
If disease was an issue the previous year, steam cleaning is advised along with a thorough disinfectant with either Cyclix or Kenocox - once after the sheds have dried out and before calving begins.
Any gates and other calf rearing equipment should also be cleaned and disinfected thoroughly.

In addition, ensure all gates are in good working order including the calving gate(s). The same goes for drinking troughs and lights.
