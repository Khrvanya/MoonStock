Marginal improvement in January PPIOrnua's Purchase Price Index (PPI) has seen a marginal increase in its latest index for the month of January, the co-operative has confirmed.
The index set for January 2019 is 107.6, adjusted from 107.5 in December 2018.
This converts to 32.2c/L including VAT, based on Ornua's product purchase mix and assumed costs of 6.5p/L.
The January 2019 index remains largely unchanged from the previous month, with higher SMP and butter prices offset by a combination of lower spot returns and the product mix in the month, according to a spokesperson for Ornua.
While only marginally higher than the October and December indices of 107.5, the latest return still marks the highest value the PPI has been at since last September, when 111.6 was recorded.
