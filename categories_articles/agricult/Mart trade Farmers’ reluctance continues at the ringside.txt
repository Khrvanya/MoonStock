Mart trade Farmers’ reluctance continues at the ringsideSo far this year, there has been a sluggish start to the mart trade. Although individual marts have recorded slight increases in recent days, overall numbers are still low.
Again, with no more progress made when it comes to the Brexit saga; beef farmers are waiting anxiously to see what way proceedings unfold.
Farmers are also waiting to see how the weather fairs out, with sellers holding onto cattle to coincide with the onset of grass growth; which has been relatively good over the winter, although colder weather is forecast over the coming days.
Saying that, farmers are not shying away from quality lots and, like what was similar in the trade over the last couple of months, quality cattle are being sought after.
In addition, mart managers have noted that weanling prices have increased - albeit slightly, with good demand for bulls that require further feeding.
Turning to the calf trade, these sales have begun, but will not reach massive heights for another couple of weeks.

Kilkenny Mart
A larger sale took place at Kilkenny Mart on Thursday last, January 24. A total of 580 cattle went under the hammer and a steady trade was reported.
'In-spec' cattle were reported to be in demand, but 'overage' and non-QA stock were harder sold.
According to the mart's auctioneer George Candler: "The trade remains steady which is a complement to buyers who are purchasing stock in the most uncertain period facing agriculture in years.
"People are fed up listening to the word - Brexit, but unfortunately, if we have a negative outcome, the outcome for beef - and perhaps dairy farming - could be catastrophic.
"Hopefully, we will not encounter such a scenario, but we need clarity very quickly," he added.
Lighter heifer lots peaked at EUR2.82/kg. In general, the heavier lots made EUR1.80-2.35/kg, EUR1.70-2.20/kg was paid for the forward store lots and the lighter store classes (<400kg) made EUR1.60-2.82/kg.
Sample heifer prices:

Charolais: 540kg - EUR1,030 or EUR1.91/kg;
Aberdeen Angus: 515kg - EUR1,190 or EUR2.31/kg;
Limousin: 450kg - EUR920 or EUR2.04/kg;
