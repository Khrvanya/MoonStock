Mart trade Feedlot buyers very active at the ringsideWhile mart managers have reported larger numbers in recent days, they too have noted the presence of feedlot buyers.

Feedlot buyers are after that heavier bullock or heifer that requires further feeding. Weanling prices are holding steady and have improved in some cases.
While the weather turned difficult at the weekend, it doesn't compare with the weather we were experiencing this time last year, when the 'Beast from the East' had the country in its grip.
