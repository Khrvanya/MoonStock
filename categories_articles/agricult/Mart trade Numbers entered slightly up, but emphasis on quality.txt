Mart trade Numbers entered slightly up, but emphasis on qualityUnfortunately, the mart trade has remained on par with last week in the majority of cases. The uncertainty hanging over the entire industry is in no doubt having an impact ringside.
Numbers were reported to have increased marginally, with some mart managers noting that quality cattle are achieving high prices.
Tom Maguire - Ballinrobe Mart manager - said: "The trade has followed the pre-Christmas period, with the emphasis very much on quality. Anything 'nice' is making plenty and anything plain is a bad trade - the very same as before Christmas."
