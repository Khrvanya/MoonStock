Mart trade Poor weather fails to dampen ringside positivityWhile the wet weather has returned, for the most part, cattle sales have remained upbeat in the majority of cases.
Feedlot buyers are still after that heavier bullock or heifer that requires further feeding. Weanling prices continue to hold steady.
Mart managers have highlighted the continued demand for the better-quality animal, with cow prices reported to be holding steady.
