Mart trade Sluggish trade, but lighter store cattle increase in priceFrom speaking with mart managers and indeed farmers in recent days, it is clear that both suckler farmers and finishers are proceeding with an air of caution when it comes to purchasing stock.
And why wouldn't they? With poor prices on offer in the factories and with a lot of uncertainty surrounding Brexit, farmers are playing the waiting game to see what the next couple of weeks throw up.
The mart trade has remained sluggish since the turn of the year and the number of cattle presented for sale is still on the small side.
The continued grass growth and mild weather has farmers thinking about buying cattle for grass. However, these too are proceeding with caution as who can forget the spring of 2018.
On the other hand, a number of calves are beginning to come on stream as we enter in the third week of January and the number of these animals is set to accelerate in the coming weeks and months.
Despite the uncertainty, mart managers - in some parts - have noticed an improvement in price for lighter, store cattle.
