Mart trade ‘Grass buyers’ begin to emerge at the ringsideGrass buyers are beginning to emerge in certain regions across the country and are playing a vital role in boosting cattle prices.
Some farmers are aiming to source stock before the peak grass buying period kicks into gear and - generally - when cattle prices increase.
In recent days, competition among buyers for quality stock drove the cattle trade and mart managers have reported good clearance rates right across the board and better prices.
Furthermore, mart managers have noted that the prices paid for cull cows have increased. However, the recent spell of bad weather had a negative impact on numbers presented for sale in some regions.
