Martin Kennedy to be returned as NFUS vice presidentNFU Scotland's top team for 2020 will be president Andrew McCornick with vice presidents Charlie Adam and Martin Kennedy.
Sitting vice president Martin Kennedy, the only position open to election this year, is to be returned unchallenged to post after no additional nominations were received by the deadline of Wednesday, December 11.
Kennedy will seek confirmation of his re-election as vice president at the union's AGM and conference on February 6 and 7 at the Radisson Blu Hotel, Glasgow.
At the union AGM in February 2021, under the terms of the constitution, the position of president and the two vice presidential posts will all be open for nominations. By that time, president Andrew McCornick will have completed the second of his two-year terms.
McCornick commented: "I'm delighted that Martin has agreed to continue in the role as one of my vice presidents alongside fellow vice president Charlie Adam.
This continues to be a very challenging time for Scottish agriculture and having two excellent vice presidents adds great strength to our official team who are working to support our members and myself.
In the absence of a contest for the vice president position, the union will use a planned series of Regional Board AGMs in January 2020 as a platform for all members to put questions to Andrew McCornick and its chief executive, Scott Walker.

McCornick added: "It is important that we listen to and communicate with our members at all times.  With there being no requirement now to hold husting events, we can use the time at these regional AGMs to provide members with the first face-to-face opportunity in 2020 to bring forward questions to both myself and Scott."
NFUS Regional Board meetings will take place between January 8 and 23, 2020.
Commenting on his impending re-election Mr. Kennedy said: "It's a great honour to represent NFU Scotland as vice president, a role I have enjoyed over the past three years.
"These are very busy times for the union, we are entering a decade that will bring great change, challenge and opportunity and I am delighted to be able to help the work NFUS is doing on behalf of almost 9,000 members across Scotland."
