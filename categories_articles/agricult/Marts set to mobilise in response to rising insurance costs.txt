Marts set to mobilise in response to rising insurance costsMarts around the country have started to mobilise in an effort to address rising insurance premiums across the board.
Letters will be issued to all managers this week by Donegal Livestock Mart manager Eimear McGuinness as she endeavours to gather everyone together to discuss the matter in more detail.
In the letter, McGuinness says that most marts throughout the country, regardless of claim history, have seen a rise in their insurance premiums and one of the fundamental problems was the lack of competition in the market.
"We are proposing that as a sector we need to help ourselves here; there are only 80 or 90 marts in the country and FBD claims they are costing it money due to the number of claims," McGuinness cites.
FBD was asked by the Public Finance committee last May to show the figures in respect of these claims but, they have failed to do so.  They should have no problem in producing the figures to back up these findings.
The north-west mart manager went on to say that extensive research into the whole area was carried out over the past year and following on from that, it was now necessary to ensure the mart sector was protected.
"We also know that some marts are struggling to keep operating with the massive surge in insurance costs among other things and it is with this in mind that we are including a simple questionnaire for all marts with the letter," she continued.
The questionnaire looks at the following areas:

Confirmed five year claims experience - this should be requested directly from FBD / current insurer or through the broker. Settled figures should also be provided or, where claims are not settled, the outstanding estimates/provisions should be given;
Wage roll (by category);
Turnover.  Letters will be issued to all managers this week by Donegal Livestock Mart manager Eimear McGuinness as she endeavours to gather everyone together to discuss the matter in more detail.
