Meat Promotion Wales campaigns sweep up 4 major PR awardsHybu Cig Cymru - Meat Promotion Wales (HCC), has scooped four major awards at the 2019 CIPR Cymru Wales PRide Awards ceremony in Cardiff for its work promoting the nation's PGI lamb and beef.
More than 220 industry professionals gathered at The Exchange Hotel in Cardiff for the nation's annual public relations showpiece, hosted by BBC Wales presenter Jason Mohammad.
The red meat levy body welcomed the recognition of its innovative campaigns and pledged to build on this work as agriculture enters a crucial period of change and uncertainty.
The gala evening saw leading organisations and communications teams celebrate the best of the industry, with HCC receiving a 'Gold' for Best Use of Influencer Relations and 'Silver' for Best Event, Best Use of Social Media and Best Publication.
Commenting on the win Rhys Llywelyn, market development manager at Hybu Cig Cymru, said:
"As the nature of marketing and communications has changed over recent years with the growth of digital and social media, we've sought to ensure a balance between traditional forms of engagement along with spearheading a more digitally-targeted approach to our work.
We have plans to build on this work over the next few months. It's a difficult time for agriculture, as Brexit combines with other factors to produce uncertainty and price volatility for farmers.
"HCC can't influence the political picture, but we will do what we can to ensure we tell the positive story of quality and sustainability which is at the heart of our beef and lamb industries.

"We're also determined to do this in the most cost-effective way possible, to maximise the impact of our advertising spend in our vital domestic market."
The CIPR PRide Awards is the UK's most prestigious nation-wide awards scheme, recognising excellence in public relations and communications across Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and six English regions.
