Medicines improvement notice issued to AurivoAn Aurivo store in Northern Ireland has been issued with an animal medicines improvement notice by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD).
Issued this morning (Tuesday, February 12), the notice was issued to the Northern Irish branch of the agribusiness.
According to the veterinary authority, the firm contravened the Veterinary Medicines Regulation (VMR) 2013 at its premises in Omagh, Co. Tyrone.

Ordering the company to improve on this, the authority said:
"All POM-VPS supplies must be prescribed by a suitably qualified person and full records kept of purchaser, product, date of supply, quantity and batch number.
