Meet the judges of All Breeds All Britain Calf Show 2020The annual All Breeds All Britain (ABAB) Calf Show will again be held at the East of England Showground, Peterborough. Organised by Holstein Young Breeders (HYB), the calf show is a highlight of the dairy calendar and will be held from October 16-18, 2020.
In addition to the Holstein classes, the show will feature six other dairy breeds: British Friesian; Jersey; Guernsey; Brown Swiss; Ayrshire; and Dairy Shorthorn.
The HYB competitions extend beyond the show ring and with support from principal sponsor Semex.
The Littlestar Award will be presented to a HYB member aged 17 years or under, who has made an outstanding contribution to the Holstein breed and their HYB club. The winner of this prestigious award will receive the Littlestar painting, which will be presented during the prize-giving at the show.
Other accolades include: Stand competitions; the Louise Hartley Award; and the acclaimed Dick Stapleton Award. This is presented to a young breeder, of any age and from any breed, who is recognised by the ABAB team for being extremely helpful and always going above and beyond when contributing to their club and breed.
Adding a little competitive fun, contending teams will be required to construct stands based on the event theme, which will be confirmed over the next couple of months, whilst also making sure their cattle lines and calves look immaculate. The team who embraces the theme the best is rewarded for its inspiration and efforts.
And the Judges are...
HYB is delighted to have the expertise of Ben Yates as National Holstein Calf Show judge and Brian Weatherup Jr as master judge for the National Holstein Showmanship competition.
Ben Yates is farm manager for the Y-Farm Partnership, Shepton Mallet, Somerset, which is a modern dairy unit milking 1,200 Holsteins. With his wife and two boys, Ben also has a small herd of his own animals under the Wowcow prefix.
During his time managing The Wyndford Herd in Shropshire, Ben enjoyed success showing animals he'd bred across the UK and in Europe.
