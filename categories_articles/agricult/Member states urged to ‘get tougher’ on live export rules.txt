Member states urged to ‘get tougher’ on live export rulesThe EU and its member states must "get tougher" on enforcing existing rules on protecting transported animals and penalise all offenders, the European Parliament's Agriculture Committee has stated.
In a resolution - adopted by 22 votes in favour to 12 against - with four abstentions, the Agriculture Committee reiterated parliament's 2012 call for a strong and harmonised enforcement of the 2005 EU law on the protection of animals during transport.
As it stands, the committee warns that the rules are "poorly applied" in some member states.
Particularly, the committee is urging member states to carry out more unannounced and risk-based checks - with tougher penalties for offenders.
Its calling for a reduction in transport time and transport carcasses rather than live animals; and better enforcement of existing rules - with the help of new technology.
Tougher penalties
A statement on behalf of the MEPs who voted to pass the resolution said: "To this end, the EU Commission should not shy away from imposing sanctions on member states which fail to apply the EU rules correctly.
"Member states, for their part, should prosecute breaches of the EU rules with effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties, harmonised at EU level, reflected the damage, scope, duration and recurrence of the infringement."
These MEPs argued that penalties should include a confiscation of vehicles and mandatory retraining of staff in animal welfare.

MEPs want to deploy modern technology to improve enforcement of current rules.
They called on the commission to develop geo-location systems that would enable animals' location and the duration of journeys in vehicles to be tracked.
They also demand "a real-time feedback loop" between points of departure and arrival and penalties for those who falsely fill in journey logs.
The Agriculture Committee's proposed steps for tackling animal welfare issues include:

Carrying out more unannounced and risk-based checks;
Informing authorities in all countries along the transport route if a breach is identified;
Pushing transporters to develop systems to prevent breaches;
Suspending or withdrawing transporters' licences for repeat offences;
Banning non-compliant vehicles and vessels;
Adapting ports for animal welfare requirements and improve pre-loading checks.In a resolution - adopted by 22 votes in favour to 12 against - with four abstentions, the Agriculture Committee reiterated parliament's 2012 call for a strong and harmonised enforcement of the 2005 EU law on the protection of animals during transport.
