Minister Doyle launches Coillte’s National Fire Training DayCoillte's National Fire Training Day for 2019 has been launched today (Thursday, March 21) at Avondale House, Co. Wicklow, by the Minister of State for Food, Forestry and Horticulture, Andrew Doyle.
In launching the training day, Minister Doyle urged farmers, forest owners, forest managers and the public of the need to be alert to the risk of wildfires over the coming summer months.
He also called for anyone enjoying outdoor recreation to behave responsibly and within the law.
Wildfires place enormous strain on the emergency services and put the lives of rural dwellers and emergency service personnel at considerable risk.
Minister Doyle added: "Following dry weather patterns, a wildfire risk can quickly develop in all areas where flammable vegetation such as grasses, gorse and heather are present."
