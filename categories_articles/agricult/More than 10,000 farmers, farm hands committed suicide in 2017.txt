  More than 10,000 farmers, farm hands committed suicide in 2017In 2017, 10,655 people involved in agriculture committed suicide in India, according to data released January 2, 2020 by the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB). The official agency, however, highlighted that the toll was the lowest since 2013.
Among those who took their lives, 5,955 were farmers / cultivators and 4,700 agricultural labourers -- both lower than in 2016. They comprised 8.2 per cent of all suicide cases in the country in 2017.
NCRB had released the 2017 crime data last October 2019, but held back information on suicides. The next month it disclosed farmers' suicide data for 2016, claiming there was a decline. 
In 2016, 6270 farmers killed themselves, down from 8,007 in 2015, while 5,109 farm hands committed suicide, up from 4,595.
The number of women farmers committing suicide, however, jumped to 480 in 2017 from 275 in '16.
