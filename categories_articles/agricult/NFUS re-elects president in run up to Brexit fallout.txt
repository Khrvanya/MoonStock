NFUS re-elects president in run up to Brexit falloutMembers of the the National Farmers' Union of Scotland (NFUS), the country's foremost farmer representative association, have re-elected its president to another term in office, as it prepares for the fallout from Brexit.
Andrew McCornick, a mixed enterprise (suckler and sheep) farmer from Dumfriesshire, was elected unopposed, having already spent two years at the helm of the NFUS.
He will now serve another two-year term, after which he will have served the maximum amount of time in charge - two terms of two years each.
McCornick said that he had confidence in his colleagues to prepare for the UK's departure from the European Union.
"Throughout the protracted and frustrating Brexit process, NFUS has been crystal clear about its priorities, and through our 'Steps to Change' work we have mapped out our thoughts on a new agricultural policy for Scotland," said McCornick.
He will be assisted in his duties by newly-elected vice-presidents Martin Kennedy, from Perthshire, and Charlie Adam, form Aberdeenshire (the association's current livestock committee chairman).

"There are difficult and challenging times ahead but Martin, Charlie and I have been given a clear mandate by members to represent them and we are honoured to carry their message forward," added McCornick.
NFUS 'Next Generation'
Personal changes have not been limited to the top of the NFUS in recent weeks.
Late last month (January), the association's 'Next Generation Working Group' elected both a new chairman and vice-chairman.
The NFUS' Next Generation initiative is geared towards young farmers entering the sector, and how they can be represented and assisted.
