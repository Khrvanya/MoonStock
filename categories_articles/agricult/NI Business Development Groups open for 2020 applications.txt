NI Business Development Groups open for 2020 applicationsNorthern Ireland's Business Development Groups (BDG) scheme will reopen for a further tranche of newcomers.
This year's scheme will see the addition of a new 'Environmental Farming' option.
The new option will provide farmers and growers with the opportunity to discuss how they can bring about environmental benefits by managing their land to enhance biodiversity, water quality and air quality.
Applications must be submitted by 4:00pm on January 24, 2020.
Many farm businesses have benefitted from participating in the BDG scheme since its launch in 2015.
The scheme is designed to bring small groups of farmers together locally, to enhance their knowledge of business management, new technologies and innovative ways of working.
What's involved?
The Business Development Groups scheme was launched in November 2015 and today there are over 140 groups in operation.
