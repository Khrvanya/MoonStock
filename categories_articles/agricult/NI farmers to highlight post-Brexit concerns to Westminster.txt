"We want to make sure that any any food that comes in [to the UK] from outside deals like Australia or the US would meet our Red Tractor Quality Assured standards.
We will be bringing over a number of farmers from Northern Ireland and there'll also be representatives from the Farmers' unions of England, Scotland and Wales.
The UFU president told this publication he expects that "approximately 35 - 40 farmers will travel out to the event in London".
