Last Saturday, December 21, an event called 'Christmas Tractors of Nenagh' took place in the Co. Tipperary town to raise money for two very worthwhile causes.
The event saw all types of farm machinery decorated in the seasonal fashion, with even Santa making an appearance.
The two charities that benefited from the event was Embrace Farm and 'Billy's Recovery'.
The former charity is a farm accident support network, supporting those who have been affected by farming accidents - be they victims, or the families of people who have died as a result of farming accidents.
'Billy's Recovery' is a charity set up in aid of young Billy Goulding, who was left paralysed after contracting a virus.
The event was organised by the north Tipperary-based non-profit community organisation 'Ballycommon Sponsored Ride'.
