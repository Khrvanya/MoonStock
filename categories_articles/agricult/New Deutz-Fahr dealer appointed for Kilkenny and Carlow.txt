The outlet will be an agent not only for Deutz-Fahr tractors, but also combine harvesters and machinery. The announcement was made via social media channels just before Christmas - on December 22.

A well-known business in the region, the dealership already holds several agencies, including Krone and Amazone.

Various product and marketing roles followed within the organisation until he was promoted to the position of the group's UK marketing manager in 2010.
He held that position until sales management responsibilities were added in January of 2018.

A company spokesman said: "With more than 15 years of experience gained in sales and marketing within the SDF Group, Mr. Barnwell has the appropriate credentials to take the company forward in the UK and Ireland and to face the numerous opportunities and challenges that exist - within the combine harvester and small, medium and large-horsepower tractor market sectors."
In other recent SDF news, Deutz-Fahr's new factory has been busy churning out tractors. The so-called 'Deutz-Fahr Land' opened back in 2017.
