The new appointment has international experience, having previously worked on a large dairy farm in Germany, with a particular focus on the performance potential of a dairy herd.
This included focusing on nutrition, breeding and environment to maximise growth, yield and fertility potential to improve the profitability and sustainability of the farm, she said.
Commenting, O'Sullivan said: "When I took on the role of milk replacer specialist with Dairygold I developed a keen interest in the nutrition of calves and the impact that this early management has on future performance.
"I officially joined Volac as a business manager in late February 2019 and look forward to continue working closely with farmers and businesses to ensure the highest level of nutritional support is offered to our farmers to promote high-yielding sustainable herds."
