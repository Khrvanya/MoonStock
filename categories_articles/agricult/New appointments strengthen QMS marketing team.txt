New appointments strengthen QMS marketing teamQuality Meat Scotland (QMS) has strengthened its marketing and communications team with the appointment of two new members of staff.
At a time when the red meat industry is being attacked by anti-meat activists and misinformation, the two new appointments will tie in with the extensive work already being done to promote and market red meat to consumers across the world.
They will support activities to pursue a positive image, understanding and sales of the Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork brands on behalf of the Scottish red meat industry.

Lesley Cameron, who has over 20 years' experience within the food and drinks industry, including working with Kettle Produce, Macsween of Edinburgh and more recently with Baxters Food Group, has been appointed as director of marketing and communications.
She replaces Carol McLaren, who left QMS in July after 10 years in the role.

Cameron will lead the future strategy, brand delivery and evaluation of all marketing and communications activities plus wider corporate and industry communications.
Her remit also covers QMS's health and education activity and communicating the work of our industry development and economic services teams. Issues management is another key aspect of the role.
Also joining QMS is Ruth McClean (pictured top), who previously worked with NFU Scotland for six years, and has over 13 years of experience in the communications and media industry.
McClean will become QMS's corporate communications manager. Through this new role, she will be working to improve on the work already being done to communicate and listen to farmers, whilst protecting and defending the industry from ever-increasing misinformation.
QMS chief executive Alan Clarke commented: "The appointment of Lesley and Ruth further strengthens the fantastic team we have here at Quality Meat Scotland, and will help to further promote a positive image of our brands on behalf of the red meat industry in Scotland.
"Lesley comes from an extensive background within marketing in the food processing sector, and this will greatly complement the work already ongoing at QMS, providing further insight to take this to the next level.
"Ruth's background in communications and knowledge of the industry will stand us in good stead to protect and defend our farmers and ensure they know what work we are doing on their behalf to protect their reputation."
