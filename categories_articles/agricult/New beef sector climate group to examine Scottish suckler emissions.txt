New beef sector climate group to examine Scottish suckler emissionsA new farmer-led group will examine how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the Scottish suckler herd.
Co-chaired by former NFU Scotland president Jim Walker, the group will consider proposals for alternative ways to support the suckler sector to mitigate its environmental impact and identify practical ways in which it can reduce its emissions.
It will also produce recommendations to improve the efficiency, productivity and profitability of Scottish beef, including changes to breeding and feeding practices and the restoration and improvement of natural on-farm habitats.
Announcing the group, Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: "Our beef sector must change and adapt if we are to meet our ambitious climate change and biodiversity targets.
"While our Programme for Government has already set out steps in response to the climate emergency, I have asked Jim Walker to chair a farmer-led group to specifically look at what our beef suckler herd needs to do and bring forward initial proposals next month.
I have been clear that our farmers, crofters and land managers are part of the climate solution. But equally, I am clear that achieving our legally binding commitments will require everyone to consider what they can do to ensure they play their part in driving the sector towards a low-carbon, sustainable future.
Walker added: "The industry has faced multiple challenges over the last 25 years and its resilience and ability to rise to these challenges and adapt is remarkable.
"Providing progressive beef farmers with the tools to make their businesses more productive and efficient, alongside measures to improve on farm emissions to help fight climate change, is yet another chapter in this story and is potentially game changing.

"Naturally reared, climate-friendly Scotch suckler bred beef needs to be differentiated from imports and dairy beef to give consumers a clear choice.
"This initiative will give those farmers who want to be involved a real chance of delivering this, helping make their businesses more robust."
Debate
Holyrood is set to debate the role of agriculture in protecting the environment and tackling climate change today (February 20).
The motion, set by Maurice Golden, MSP for West Scotland, backs the establishment of a new Agricultural Modernisation Fund.
The motion commends Scottish farmers for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by just shy of 30% since 1990.
It states: "The Scottish Parliament recognises that Scottish farmers already work hard to preserve the landscape, improve biodiversity, plant and manage woodland, restore peatland, improve water and soil quality and generate renewable energy and acknowledges the view that there is a need to develop practical and progressive policies that allow food producers to continue running their businesses in a more sustainable and efficient manner."
