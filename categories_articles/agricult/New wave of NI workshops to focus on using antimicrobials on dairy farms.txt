New wave of NI workshops to focus on using antimicrobials on dairy farmsThe College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise (CAFRE) has announced plans to host a further series of workshops on using antimicrobials responsibly on dairy farms.
More than 400 people attended the last set of courses in Northern Ireland, which are offered as part of the Farm Family Key Skills (FFKS) Scheme.
The workshops are free for farmers, their family members and farm staff, and will be delivered by veterinary practitioners.
It will provide opportunities for informative discussion which aims to help milk producers make informed choices in developing animal health protocols on their own farms.

Antimicrobials, especially antibiotics, have been one of the most powerful drugs used to combat disease for many decades.
They are used widely in both human medicine and animal health. But the issue of antimicrobial resistance is increasing and it is now a major cause of concern worldwide.
Every possible action needs to be taken to manage the use of antibiotics on the farm to help tackle this problem.
