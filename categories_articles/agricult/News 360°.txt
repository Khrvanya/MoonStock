  News 360°Dead zone in making? 

A mass of green algae, called green tide, has covered the southern coast of China and Tai, the third largest freshwater lake in the country. The authorities say the bloom is because of warming sea and lake water. Green groups link the bloom to water rich in runoff fertilisers and industrial waste. Such big blooms can create oxygen-depleted dead zones.
 
  An ice shelf, eight times the size of New Delhi, has broken off Greenland's Petermann glacier. This is possibly the biggest glacier collapse in recorded history. Located 1,000 km south of the North Pole, the glacier had been disintegrating over the past couple of years.  

  Meat from the offspring of a cloned cow entered the food chain in the UK a year ago, said the Food Standards Agency. The official confirmation of breach of food laws comes amid allegations that over 100 cattle in the UK are bred from clones. UK bans clone-derived food.

  The EU has offered to bear more than its share of construction cost, about US $1.8 billion, of the international nuclear fusion reactor that is getting delayed due to skyrocketing costs. The overall cost of the project is now US $21 billion, some three times the original cost. Considered the Holy Grail of clean energy, the experimental reactors would be ready by 2019.

  Heavy rains and stormy winds battered central Europe in early August, causing flash floods and killing scores of people. Poland was the worst hit.

 Top wheat supplier Russia banned the export of grain until December 31 to keep prices low at home, amid the worst drought in decades. The announcement catapulted wheat futures in Chicago and Europe up 10 per cent to new two-year highs and prompted a warning from the UN food agency of a "serious" situation on world food markets. 

 Coming under international pressure, Israel said it  would allow 2,000 truckloads of food and construction material a week into its blockaded Palestine territory, Gaza. UN said the supply is not enough to rebuild its crumbled infrastructure.

 Residents of Samui Island in the Gulf of Thailand, led by the governor, formed human chains and protested a concession by the central government to explore for oil 42 km offshore. Oil drilling so close to the shore would destroy the coastal ecosystem, affecting farmers and fishers, they said.

 The UN Development Programme established a fund for Ecuador that would receive about US $7 billion in aid from developed countries in exchange for a promise to leave about 846 million barrels of crude oil in the ground beneath ecologically sensitive Yasuni National Park. 

 Saudi Arabia ordered mobile-network operators to suspend Blackberry services in the kingdom, because its security agencies cannot crack the smartphone platform's code to monitor exchanged data. The United Arab Emirates plans to do the same in October. 

 Myanmar said it would triple the size of its tiger reserve in Hukaung Valley, making it the largest tiger reserve in the world. The expanded park would be the size of Kuwait. After decades of poaching the reserves may hold 50 tigers. 

 Genetically modified canola grown in North Dakota has contaminated 80 per cent of wild canola plants in the US state, said scientists. They have found similar transgenic contamination in Canada and Japan.

 British Petroleum finished pumping cement into its ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico on August 5 and said it would completely plug the blow-out by the end of August. 

 A court in Canada banned the use of sonar waves to map the Arctic waters of Lancaster Sound. Responding to the plea of the Innuit people of Nunavut, the court said sonar waves could affect marine organisms like rare narwhals and beluga whales that inhabit the richest ecosystem in North Hemisphere.
