North Cork Co-op and Newtownsandes merger approvedNorth Cork Co-operative Creameries Limited has today (Friday, January 25) confirmed that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has approved the proposed merger of North Cork and Newtownsandes Co-operative Society Limited (Moyvane, Co. Kerry).
The merger was voted on and approved at separately held Special General Meetings (SGMs) by the shareholders of both co-operatives in December 2018.
The new merger will now be formally completed in the coming weeks.
A statement issued this morning outlined that both co-operatives are "friendly and neighboring societies" that already work closely together in a commercial dairy processing arrangement.
North Cork Creameries already processes some 23 million litres of milk annually into a range of dairy products for Newtownsandes.
The businesses of both co-operatives will be merged with all current milk collection and processing arrangements continuing as normal.
North Cork will now process over 240 million litres of milk annually, with a capacity to increase processing throughput to over 360 million litres, according to the statement.
This will cater for ongoing expansion by milk producers across its operating region.
'Strength to strength'
Both co-operatives have been in discussion since January 2018 about the possibility of an amalgamation.
