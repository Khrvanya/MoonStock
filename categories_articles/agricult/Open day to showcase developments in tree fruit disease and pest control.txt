Open day to showcase developments in tree fruit disease and pest controlDisease and pest management control strategies will be the focus of research presented at a major tree fruit industry event in spring 2020.
Results from the latest AHDB-funded crop protection research on apple canker, powdery mildew, plum rust and spotted wing drosophila will be shared at the annual Tree Fruit Day, taking place in Kent.
Environmental sustainability will also be an important focus, with information on enhancing the ecology of new orchards and improving the effectiveness of biological control products.
Scott Raffle, AHDB knowledge exchange manager, said: "Our work to support integrated pest management strategies to ensure the industry remains resilient in the face of declining crop protection products has made significant progress this year.
There'll be a huge amount of important information available to support growers and agronomists in the upcoming season at this not-to-be-missed event.
Delegates will also hear more about the new Plum Demonstration Centre launched earlier this year to demonstrate best practice and to increase the uptake of new technology in the tree fruit industry.
