Iordan and Nutu, both of Dunsink Road, Birmingham, and Manu, of no fixed address, have been remanded in custody ahead of a first appearance at Northampton Magistrates' Court today (Wednesday, October 9).
Inspector Tracy Moore, who leads on rural crime for Northamptonshire Police, said: "We know these crimes caused a great deal of upset and anger to both the owners of the animals and to rural communities.
The charging and remand of three people in relation to Operation Stock represents a huge amount of teamwork within our force and our neighbouring forces.
"I'd like to thank our farming and rural communities again for the support they have offered throughout the investigation."
