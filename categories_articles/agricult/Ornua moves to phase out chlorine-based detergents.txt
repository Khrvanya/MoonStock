Ornua moves to phase out chlorine-based detergentsOrnua has moved to phase out chlorine-based dairy detergents over the next two years.
The decision was made by the board of directors at the co-operative, which is Ireland's largest dairy exporter.
In a statement to AgriLand, a representative for Ornua said: "At the end of 2018, the board of directors of Ornua Cooperative considered the progress made, since 2007, to reduce Trichloromethane (TCM) residue in Irish dairy products.
"While significant progress has been made to reduce chlorine residues, it was felt that more work was needed by all stakeholders to embed and drive change across the supply chain."
On this note, at its December 2018 board meeting, the directors resolved unanimously to refocus efforts in a two-pronged approach.
