Pembrokeshire dairy farmer appointed as new FUW vice presidentPembrokeshire dairy farmer Dai Miles has been elected as the new Farmers' Union of Wales vice president at the FUW's Grand Council Meeting in Aberystwyth.
Dai has been the FUW's milk and dairy produce committee chairman since 2017 and is also one of the four founding directors of organic milk co-operative Calon Wen.
The co-operative not only sells on its member's milk to processors, but has also created its own brand of dairy products which are available through all major retailers in Wales.
Background
Dai grew up in Felin Fach near Lampeter and went to Ysgol Gyfun Aberaeron. He is a fluent Welsh speaker and attended the Welsh Agricultural College in Aberystwyth where he received a National Diploma in Agriculture and completed a sandwich year at Godor Nantgaredig.
After college Dai spent five years as a herdsman of 160 cows at Waun Fawr Glynarthen Llandysul, then a further five years at IGER Trawscoed working as a relief herdsman between the two dairy herds - Lodge Farm and the organic herd at Ty Gwyn.
In 1997, in partnership with his wife Sharron, he took on the tenancy of Barnsley Farm, a 143ac farm in west Wales. At the time it was a stock and arable unit, which they converted into an organic dairy unit starting with 33 cows and leased milk quota.
In 2001, they took on a further 90ac of pasture land and then in 2005 the neighbouring farm within the same estate. In 2018, they purchased a neighbouring farm from the estate and installed a modern robotic milking system on the holding.

Currently, the couple run a herd of 120 cows and 65 youngstock.
'A voice for all'
Speaking about his appointment, Dai said: "One reason why I am proud to be a member of the FUW is that all members have a voice whether they farm large businesses or smaller farms.
"The importance the union gives to the cultural and linguistic heritage of Wales was also an important factor in my decision to join this union.
I am a strong believer that if you are a member of an organisation you should fully participate in that organisation and assist to the best of your abilities to ensure its future and vitality.
"Therefore, I am delighted to take on this new challenging role in the union and help the FUW and its members to fight for a better future for all our farmers in Wales."
Welcoming Dai to the presidential policy team, FUW president Glyn Roberts added: "In times like these, we need thought leaders, who can help us steer, lobby and negotiate the right policies for agriculture in Wales to ensure we have thriving, sustainable family farms in Wales for generations to come.
"Dai has plenty of experience and knowledge of agriculture across Wales and a real sense of why #FarmingMatters. I am grateful to have him on the presidential policy team and look forward to working with him."
