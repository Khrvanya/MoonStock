Pics Huge John Deere tractor clearance auction pulls the puntersThe much-talked-about auction, involving the disposal of a huge fleet of tractors and equipment from the UK-based Hawk Plant hire group, is taking place today and tomorrow.
Proceedings kicked off this morning. Tim Scrivener was there for AgriLand. He snapped these shots on-site, as punters began to descend on the venue.

Today (Thursday, March 14), the auction (split between two rings) was ongoing at Charleston House, Cruckmoor Lane, Prees Green, Whitchurch, Shropshire (England).
The tractors have now been sold.

The fleet included a pair of 2016 John Deere 8370R models. There were also six 2016 7R Series tractors. There were 111 6R/M Series tractors (mostly from 2016).

Other lots that went under the hammer today included agricultural trailers, telescopic handlers and some of the (smaller) excavators.

Tomorrow (Friday, March 15), proceedings move to another location - albeit nearby. That venue is Sandford Industrial Park, Sandford (also in Whitchurch, Shropshire).
Two rings will be in operation again; working through a catalogue that includes (larger) excavators, dozers, wheeled loaders and other types of plant/construction equipment.

As these pictures show, the Prees Green site was a busy place today - with prospective punters and machines jostling for position.
