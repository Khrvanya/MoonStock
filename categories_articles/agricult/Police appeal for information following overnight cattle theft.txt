Police appeal for information following overnight cattle theftPolice have appealed for information relating to the theft of a number of cattle in Co. Armagh overnight.
Issuing a statement over social media on the matter, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Armagh account said:
"Police in Armagh are investigating a report of a theft in the Tassagh area."

The police force said it has received reports that five cattle have been taken from the area some time between 7:00pm last night (Wednesday, February 20) and 8:00am this morning.
"If you saw anything suspicious around the area of the Granemore Road, Tassagh, please get in contact with us on 101 ref: 233 21/02/19 or you can contact Crimestoppers on: 0800-555111," the PSNI stated.
This follows on from the news earlier today that the Ulster Farmers' Union (UFU) is asking its members to complete a short survey in order to gain an insight into the real extent of the impacts of rural crime - and why, despite this, many rural crimes go unreported.
Rural crime is an increasing and costly issue for farmers across Northern Ireland, rising as high as PS2.6 million in 2017.
As part of the survey, members are asked how they view rural crime as well as the official response they receive when reporting incidents.
