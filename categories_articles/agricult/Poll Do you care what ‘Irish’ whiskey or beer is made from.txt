Poll Do you care what ‘Irish’ whiskey or beer is made fromThe on-going drama of malting barley price raised the old issue this week - do 'Irish' drinks need to be produced from Irish products? Does Origin green not have to mean origin Ireland?
Please scroll down to take the poll and don't forget to click 'vote' after each question to find out how the poll is progressing.
Many of the major drinks producers in this country pride themselves and their advertising campaigns on Irish farmers producing Irish barley to make Irish whiskey and beer.
Yet malt is imported into this country; maize is imported; hops are imported. The percentage of home-grown products being used is unclear. What proportion of the ingredients need to be Irish for that product to be called Irish?
Also, are consumers willing to pay a small bit extra to support the Irish farmer? Over the years malting barley growers have often said that a cent on the pint would make a big difference to the bottom line on their farm.
One of the most important questions is do consumers actually care if their drink of choice is made from Irish ingredients or not?
