"He's not complying with the inquiry so far," House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel told the CBS news program "Face the Nation."  "They're in discussions that are ongoing and we're hoping that he will comply," he added. Engel's panel issued a subpoena for Pompeo on Sept. 27. The deadline for those documents expired on Friday.
