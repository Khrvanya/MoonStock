Potatoes Next Generation Applications open at BP2019AHDB is looking for the next batch of up-and-coming potato professionals to take part in the 2020 Next Generation programme.
Heading into its fourth intake, the successful AHDB initiative will open the recruitment process for 15 candidates from across the UK supply chain at BP2019 in Harrogate, November 21-22.
Applicants are sought from all areas of the industry and successful candidates will take part in a year-long development programme, including business and technical sessions, as well as supply chain visits.
AHDB Potatoes chairman Sophie Churchill said: "The Next Generation programme aims to provide the platform to develop future leaders and give them exposure to areas of our business which they wouldn't usually have.
"We look for people to learn about the potato sector in its entirety, with a focus on the promotion, production and protection of our industry.
"We welcome applications from different job profiles, geographic regions and market sectors, so I would urge anyone who is interested in learning about the potato industry to put themselves forward and apply."
