Premiere of ‘A True Taste of Kerrygold’ kicks off new global campaignKerrygold is placing Ireland's farming families at the fore of a major new global campaign that will reach over 36 million people worldwide in a bid to "take the Kerrygold brand to new heights".
The digital campaign - entitled 'A True Taste of Kerrygold' - puts Ireland's grass-fed family farming system firmly in the spotlight, highlighting the tradition of Irish dairy as part of a major global expansion drive for Ireland's largest food exports.
The campaign will roll out globally, including Ireland, the UK, the US and Germany.
According to brand owner Ornua, Germany is a strong market for the label, where a block of Kerrygold butter sells faster than any other food brand on supermarket shelves.
The Irish brand is also the number two butter brand in the large-scale US market where it has enjoyed double-digit volume growth for over 10 years.
Ornua attributes the success of its brand's products to the "unique taste and quality of Irish dairy that is derived from the milk of Ireland's grass-fed cows", produced by dedicated Irish family farmers.

These families "tell the story of the dedication and passion it takes to deliver the world class milk that makes Kerrygold so successful", Ornua claims.
TV broadcaster Angela Scanlon and renowned chef Paul Flynn graced the green carpet in Dublin today (Tuesday, February 12) with the three farming families for the global premier.
Commenting on the campaign, Roisin Hennerty, managing director of Ornua Foods, said:
"This new global campaign is a stand-out moment for Kerrygold on the world stage and a celebration of the daily dedication and commitment of farmers throughout Ireland which underpins its success.
For decades Kerrygold has been synonymous with the benefits of grass-fed dairy and has authentically told the story of Irish dairy farming to the world.
Hennerty highlighted the importance of the brand, claiming that it has "always been an intrinsic part of Irish identity".
"It is owned by a community of Irish farming families who have passed down their farming values and methods from generation to generation," she added.
The dairy label's global fan club includes: actress Sarah Jessica Parker; model Chrissy Tiegan; and actress Kate Beckinsale, "who last year confessed to travelling with Kerrygold in her suitcase".
