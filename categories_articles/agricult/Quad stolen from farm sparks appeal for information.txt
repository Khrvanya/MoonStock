Quad stolen from farm sparks appeal for informationAn appeal for information has been launched by police following the theft of a Honda quad late last week.
Stolen from a farm in Larne, Co. Antrim, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) issued a brief statement seeking details:
"Some time between 12:00pm and 3:00pm on Thursday August 1, a red Honda quad bike valued at PS6,500 (EUR7,076) was taken from a farm on the Ballysnod Road, Larne.
This would be a well-travelled road with plenty of vehicles passing between those times of the day.
"If you have seen anyone in the area at that time or have any information about this incident, please call 101 and quote reference number 1363 of 01/08/2019," the statement concluded.
