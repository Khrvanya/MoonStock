Renowned dairy farm for sale in North LanarkshireGalbraith has brought to the open market the spectacular East Tarbrax Farm in North Lanarkshire, a substantial dairy unit of over 500ac currently supporting 150 milking cows and followers.
East Tarbrax Farm is situated near Shotts in North Lanarkshire, 3 miles from Junction 5 of the M8 and 1 mile from the nearest train station.
Some of the farmland to the north of the holding, adjacent to Shotts, offers longer term development potential, subject to the necessary consents.

A rare opportunity
Duncan Barrie, a partner with Galbraith, said: "This is an established and renowned dairy farm with a long history in the dairy industry.
The farm presents a rare opportunity to acquire a commercial dairy farm within central Scotland, equipped with an extensive range of modern and traditional farm buildings including three robot milkers, and two dwelling houses.
"The farm is ideally suited for modern dairy farming and is accompanied by a productive block of 523.33ac of pasture and silage ground."
East Tarbrax is a very productive holding and this, coupled with the development potential of the land close to Shotts, is likely to attract a wide range of buyers, according to the selling agent.
