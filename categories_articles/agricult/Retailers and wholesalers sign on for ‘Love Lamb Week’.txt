Retailers and wholesalers sign on for ‘Love Lamb Week’Many of the UK's largest retailers and wholesalers have signed on to take part in a promotion campaign for protected geographical indication (PGI) Welsh lamb, according to Hybu Cig Cymru - Meat Promotion Wales (HCC).
In anticipation of the UK-wide 'Love Lamb Week', which takes place from September 1 to 7, the Welsh red meat industry has teamed up with supermarket chains to "ensure as many consumers as possible are reached through a variety of promotions".
Two of the largest retailers that are taking part in the initiative will feature stories and recipes on Welsh lamb in their magazines, while one will promote a competition where consumers can win a holiday in the Brecon Beacons.
Other retailers will take part in the campaign through point-of-sale marketing, which will include on-shelf branding and recipe instructions in the form of leaflets.
As well as the efforts from retailers, HCC's own 'mobile cooking theatre' will visit four stores in England and one in Wales during Love Lamb Week, with further dates towards the end of the month, to "give consumers a chance to sample Welsh Lamb for themselves".
Some of the retailers of PGI Welsh lamb include: Aldi, Asda, Booker, Co-op, Costco, Lidl, M&S, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Waitrose.

HCC is also allowing independent butchers get involved, through new recipes and point-of-sale material.
The British market is vital for Welsh lamb, and is even more so now, with Brexit causing uncertainty in terms of exports.
"We therefore regularly engage with all the large retailers to offer help with promotions, as well as independent butchers. We're delighted with the response this year, and are pleased that Welsh lamb advertising will reach so many consumers around Love Lamb Week and throughout the autumn," said Rhys Llywelyn, market development manager with HCC.
He added that, apart from working with retailers, consumer advertising will also play a role.
"This year will see an unprecedented investment in online promotion in the UK market, which offers great value for money and enables us to target messages at groups of consumers who are most likely to be interested in Welsh lamb," he concluded.
