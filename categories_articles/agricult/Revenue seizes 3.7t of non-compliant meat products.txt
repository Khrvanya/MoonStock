The smuggled alcohol, cigarettes and meat were discovered when officers searched a foreign-registered truck that had arrived in Dublin from Holyhead, having begun its journey in Romania.

The goods were discovered when officers conducted examinations of six vehicles that had arrived in Dublin Port from Poland, Lithuania and France.
These seizures are part of Revenue's ongoing operations targeting the illegal importation, supply and sale of alcohol and tobacco products in the shadow economy, according to the office.
