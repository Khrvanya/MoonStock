Russia calls new U.S. sanctions over hacking a 'propaganda attack'1 Min ReadMOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's foreign ministry said on Friday that new U.S. sanctions against Russian individuals and firms over alleged cyber crimes were a "propaganda attack" and Moscow would respond to them, though it did not say how. U.S. authorities targeted a Russian cybercriminal group known as Evil Corp, indicting its Lamborghini-driving alleged leader and ordering asset freezes against 17 of his associates over a global, $100 million digital crime spree. The foreign ministry said the United States would need to have contacted Russia to obtain evidence about the crimes, adding: "As far as we know, there have been no such requests... Just as with the previous American attacks, these too won't remain without a response." Reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Gareth JonesAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
