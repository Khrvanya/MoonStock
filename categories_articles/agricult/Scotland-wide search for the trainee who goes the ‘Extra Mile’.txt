Scotland-wide search for the trainee who goes the ‘Extra Mile’The search is on to find this year's top meat industry trainee who goes above and beyond showing true dedication to their trade.
Scottish Craft Butchers, along with sponsors Quality Meat Scotland's Scotch Butchers Club, is calling on butchers across the country, mentors and customers to nominate the best meat industry trainee for the coveted Extra Mile award.
Award organisers are looking for candidates who truly go the "extra mile", whether that be in their own progression, supporting new product development, showing excellent customer service or in any way that has a positive effect on the business they work in.
Scottish Craft Butchers chief executive Gordon King said: "To receive recognition and reward for going the extra mile in the meat industry builds confidence in the individual and satisfaction that their dedication to our profession is appreciated by colleagues and customers.
By showing that we value their time and commitment to consistently go above and beyond, we hope to inspire those in the industry to always strive for excellence in what they do.
Quality Meat Scotland chief executive Alan Clarke said: "We are delighted to support Scottish Craft Butcher's search for Scotland's top trainee.
"As an industry, it's important that we support and help to develop people coming into the sector.
It's crucial we recognise and reward individuals who are already making a difference so that we retain the very best people within the trade.
The Extra Mile award is part of a suite of training awards delivered by the Scottish Craft Butchers and supported by the Scotch Butchers Club.
