Sheep trade Farmers holding out for moreFarmers are encouraged to bargain hard when it comes to marketing their sheep. This comes as processors move to tighten their grip on the market.
Farmers in the best position to secure higher prices are those with quality assured animals and large numbers to market.
Procurement managers are starting negotiations with farmers at 500c/kg (excluding quality assurance (QA) and producer group bonuses) for hoggets.
When QA payments are factored in, this brings prices to 510-515c/kg, while factory agents are currently offering 260c/kg (excluding the Quality Assurance Scheme bonus) for well-fleshed ewes.
Kepak is quoting 500c/kg and 15c/kg QA, while both Irish Country Meats' plants are paying 500c/kg and 10c/kg QA. Kildare Chilling had no quote when contacted yesterday afternoon.
