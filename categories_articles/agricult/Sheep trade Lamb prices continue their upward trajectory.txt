Sheep trade Lamb prices continue their upward trajectoryLamb prices continue to move in an upward trajectory this week. A price of up to 525c/kg - including quality assurance (QA) bonus - was quoted to AgriLand this week.
However, reports suggest some farmers are achieving as high as 530c/kg. As a result, anyone with stock ready for slaughter should bargain hard when marketing their stock.
The price hike is as a result of strong demand. Kepak Athleague has increased its QA bonus to 15c/kg (from 5c/kg). This brings the quoted price to 510c/kg (including QA bonus) and on a par with Irish Country Meats (ICM) after the QA bonus has been added on.
Base quotes for lambs are running between 495c/kg and 500c/kg (excluding QA bonus). There was no change from last week on ewes, which are trading at 270c/kg (excluding Quality Assurance Scheme bonus).
