The ship - known as the Queen Hind - capsized in Midia Port, Romania, yesterday, Sunday, November 24, with its starboard side resting on bottom and half of the hull remaining above water.
Reports have outlined that the ship's crew of 20 Syrians and one Lebanese worker were rescued however the vast majority of the sheep remain trapped inside.
Speaking to AFP news, yesterday, Sunday, November 24, Ana-Maria Stoica, a spokeswoman for the rescue services explained that efforts were underway to rescue the sheep.
"The rescue operation is ongoing and we hope that the sheep inside the ship's hold are still alive," she told the publication yesterday.
The rescue operation is being supported by military personnel as well as police and divers.
Romania's main livestock exporter association, Acebop, has called for "an urgent investigation" into why the ship overturned.
