South Africa's Tongaat expects smaller interim loss1 Min ReadJOHANNESBURG, Jan 29 (Reuters) - South African sugar producer Tongaat Hulett said on Wednesday it expected a smaller interim loss helped by improved production in South Africa, cost-cutting and a turnaround in its business in Mozambique. It expects a headline loss for the six months to September 30, 2019, of 300-322 million rand ($21-22.5 million) versus a restated loss of 354 million a year earlier. The firm said it has entered into discussions with the JSE to request the lifting of a suspension of its shares, potentially in the first week of February. Its interim results are scheduled to be released on January 31. $1 = 14.3325 rand
