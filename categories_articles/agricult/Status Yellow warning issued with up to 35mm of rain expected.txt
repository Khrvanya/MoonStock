It will affect all of Connacht, as well as counties: Longford; Offaly; Westmeath; Cavan; Monaghan; Clare; Cork; Kerry; Limerick; and Tipperary.

This will come into effect from 12:00am tonight and remain in force until 12:00pm tomorrow.
In Donegal, a spell of snow tonight will lead to poor driving conditions and accumulations of up to 3cm. On high ground accumulations are likely to be greater, the forecaster has warned.
Meanwhile, for today's weather, this morning will see patchy rain confined to the south-west of the country with a mix of sunny spells and scattered showers elsewhere.
Cloud will build from the south during the afternoon and outbreaks of rain affecting the south-west will edge northwards, moving in across most of Munster and south Leinster during the evening.
Maximum temperatures will reach 7deg to 10deg in fresh to strong westerly winds.
