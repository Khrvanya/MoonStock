Striking Steyr ‘concept tractor’ pulls the punters at AgritechnicaOne of the most eye-catching exhibits at Agritechnica 2019 (in Germany) is this 'concept tractor' (pictured above and below) from Steyr.
The (150kW/204hp) tractor is powered by a four-cylinder FPT engine, which drives an electric generator. This generator then powers four electric wheel-motors, plus a fifth electric motor for the PTO.

This 'hybrid' tractor also has an on-board battery - with a capacity of 30kWh. The manufacturer says that a 60kWh version is possible too.

As well as having an electrically-driven PTO, the tractor can also supply electricity to power suitable implements/machines at the rear.

Interestingly, the tractor is also designed to operate whilst in 'real-time' communication with a drone - to enable it to process a greater array of (in-field) data.

Meanwhile, in related news, CNH Industrial - the conglomerate that encompasses Steyr, Case IH, New Holland and other brands - indicated that Steyr will be positioned as a "premium brand".
