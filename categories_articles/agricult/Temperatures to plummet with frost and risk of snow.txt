Temperatures to plummet with frost and risk of snowA cold, unsettled week is in store with frost and wintry precipitation on the cards, according to Met Eireann.
The coming week will bring the coldest spell of weather of the winter season so far, with temperatures set to nosedive to -5deg over the coming days, the national meteorological office warns.
There will be widespread frost and ice by night and with the increasing risk of some sleet or snow.
This morning, much of east Leinster and Ulster will be dry with frost and icy patches, which will gradually clear later. It will be cloudier to the west and south with patchy rain or drizzle.
Showers will spread from the west this afternoon. It will be a cold day with highest temperatures of 4deg to 8deg and mostly light north-west winds, but fresh in west Munster.
Many areas will be dry early tonight with clear spells and with frost and icy patches forming quickly as temperatures fall to between -1deg and +2deg.
Scattered showers in the west and north will turn to more persistent rain towards midnight and then cross the country overnight, turning wintry in places with the risk of accumulations on higher ground, Met Eireann warns.
Drying conditions will be moderate or poor for the week ahead as the weather will be quite mixed with spells of rain and showers, according to Met Eireann.
There will be limited opportunities for spraying as the weather will remain changeable.
Regarding field conditions, well and moderately-drained soils are saturated at the moment and poorly-drained soils are waterlogged.
Little change is expected for the week ahead although moderately-drained soils may also become waterlogged by the end of the week.
