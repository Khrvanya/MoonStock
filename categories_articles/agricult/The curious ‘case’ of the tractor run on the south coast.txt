The curious ‘case’ of the tractor run on the south coastThe county of Cork has been awash with tractor runs recently. Among the most recent was an escapade around the locality of Roberts Cove.
The run, which was open not only to tractors but vintage cars and other vehicles too, took place last Sunday (January 6). Proceeds from the event are destined for the Tracton Defibrillator Program.

The run included some noteworthy machines, not least a pairing of big-boned Case tractors - namely a 2294 and a 2090 (pictured below; side-by-side).

The 154hp 2294 (on the left) is certainly a lofty beast; the older 2090 (on the right) is equally imposing.
