Tractor ‘stopped in its tracks’ for unsecured loadA tractor was stopped by Gardai in the west of the country recently for improper restraint.
Taking place in Loughrea, Co. Galway, members of the Galway Road Policing Unit (RPU) stopped the driver, who was drawing an excavator in a low-loader, for not securing the load.
In a tweet posted on social media yesterday, the An Garda Siochana Twitter account noted: "Tractor stopped by Galway RPU in Loughrea District. Load not secured. Vehicle prohibited. Don't take chances."

Travelling with an unsecured load poses a number of risks for both the driver of the vehicle and other road users, the Road Safety Authority (RSA) has said.
The RSA insists that all loads must be secured even if the vehicle is only travelling a short distance or at low speeds.
Unsecured or inadequately secured loads can shift when a vehicle is in motion and may cause:

Loss of control of vehicle;
Objects to fall on or hit people;
Road obstruction or collision where a driver is required to swerve to avoid fallen items;
Failure to secure loads properly may also result in financial losses due to damaged goods and vehicles, lost working time, clean up costs and legal costs.Taking place in Loughrea, Co.
