On its Twitter page, the Gardai said yesterday: "The protest remains in place overnight and into tomorrow...during which there may be increased protest activity.
An Garda Siochana continues to advise commuters to plan your journey accordingly or use public transport where possible," the statement added.
The protesters stayed the night in Dublin city centre - around the vicinity of Merrion Square and St. Stephen's Green - with many of them sleeping in their tractors.
One participant told AgriLand yesterday that they "have no problem closing Dublin down".
James Geoghegan, from Co. Westmeath, said: ""What we're showing every TD in the country is that we can block Dublin at any time we want; we will block it down until we get what we need and what we need is a sustainable living."
He added that the protest was not only about beef prices, but also carbon tax.
