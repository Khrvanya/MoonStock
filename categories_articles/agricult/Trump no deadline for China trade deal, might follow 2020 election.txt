Trump no deadline for China trade deal, might follow 2020 election1 Min ReadLONDON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he had no deadline for reaching a trade agreement with China and it might be better to wait until after the U.S. presidential election in November 2020. "I have no deadline, no. In some ways I think I think it's better to wait until after the election with China," Trump told reporters in London where he was due to attend a meeting of NATO leaders. "But they want to make a deal now, and we'll see whether or not the deal's going to be right, it's got to be right."
