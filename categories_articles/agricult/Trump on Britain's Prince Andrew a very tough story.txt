Trump on Britain's Prince Andrew a very tough story1 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he did not know Britain's Prince Andrew but that it was a "very tough story" when asked for a reaction to the royal's decision to step back from public life.  Andrew, 59, Queen Elizabeth's second son, has stepped back from royal duties after he gave an interview last month over his friendship with the disgraced late U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein. "I don't know Prince Andrew but it's a tough story, it's a very tough story," he said. Trump is in London for a NATO summit.
