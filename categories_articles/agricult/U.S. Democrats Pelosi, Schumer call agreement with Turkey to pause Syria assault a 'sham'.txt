U.S. Democrats Pelosi, Schumer call agreement with Turkey to pause Syria assault a 'sham'1 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday called an agreement between the United States and Turkey on a pause in Ankara's offensive in northeastern Syria a "sham." The agreement "seriously undermines the credibility of America's foreign policy and sends a dangerous message to our allies and adversaries alike that our word cannot be trusted. President Erdogan has given up nothing, and President Trump has given him everything," Pelosi and Schumer said in a statement. Congress's top Democrats said the House of Representatives would vote on a bipartisan sanctions package against Turkey next week.
