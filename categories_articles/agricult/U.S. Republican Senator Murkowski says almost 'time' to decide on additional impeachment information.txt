U.S. Republican Senator Murkowski says almost 'time' to decide on additional impeachment information1 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Moderate U.S. Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski said on Monday she is curious about what former White House national security adviser John Bolton has to say, following reports of his manuscript, and it is nearly time to consider whether senators weighing evidence in the impeachment trial need additional information.
