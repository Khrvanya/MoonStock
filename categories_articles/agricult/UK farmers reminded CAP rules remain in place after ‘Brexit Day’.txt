UK farmers reminded CAP rules remain in place after ‘Brexit Day’NFU Scotland is reminding members that when the UK leaves the EU this Friday (January 31) the rules, with which they currently comply, will still apply.
There will be no changes to key schemes on February 1 as the UK enters the EU exit transition period and farmers or crofters should continue to meet all requirements.
In 2020, all existing CAP regulations remain in place. That means farmers and crofters must still comply with current rules on cross-compliance, mapping, greening and Single Application Form procedures. Alongside these requirements, compliance inspections will continue in 2020 as they did in 2019.
NFU Scotland president Andrew McCornick said: "On Brexit day, on Friday, all farmers and crofters must bear in mind that the rulebook is not being thrown out the window.
"They must ensure that they continue to comply with current regulations, if they are to avoid penalties.
It is business as usual as we enter the EU exit transition period and negotiate new trade agreements with the EU.
Farm payments
Meanwhile, the Government has confirmed details of 2020 payments to farmers, including Basic Payments Scheme and the Rural Development for England (RDPE) payments during the transition period.

A statement by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs explained Direct Payments will continue for 2020 with the available funding the same as for 2019.
The UK Government will fund existing Rural Development Programme (RDPE) projects and those approved by December 31, 2020, until those projects end.
Farming support schemes will continue to be run by:

The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) in England;
DAERA in Northern Ireland;
The Welsh Government in Wales;
The Scottish Government in Scotland.

To get payments, farms will need to follow the same standards as they do now. This includes on-site inspections.
The current framework of rules and processes will stay the same until Defra and the devolved administrations introduce new agriculture policies and schemes.
