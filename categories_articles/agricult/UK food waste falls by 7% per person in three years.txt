UK food waste falls by 7% per person in three yearsNew data shows almost half a million tonne reduction in total UK food waste in just three years - enough to fill the Royal Albert Hall 10 times.
The 480,000t of food saved from waste between 2015 and 2018 represent a 7% reduction per person.
The new data comes from sustainability not-for-profit WRAP's latest Courtauld Commitment 2025 Milestone Progress Report, which sets our progress in food waste reduction since 2007.
It reveals that households and businesses are now tackling the problem at an accelerated rate, with a greater rate of progress from 2015 to 2018 than over the preceding five years.
Since WRAP began work on household food waste, a total of 1.4 million tonnes of food has been saved from going to waste each year in UK homes compared to 2007 levels - enough each year to fill 150,000 food collection trucks.
While good progress, there is much more to do. The report shows that UK households still waste 4.5 million tonnes of food that could have been eaten, worth PS14 billion every year (PS700 for an average family with children).
The volume of food still wasted equates to 10 billion meals. A reduction of 4% in the supply chain also shows good overall progress from businesses.
The significant decrease in household food waste can be attributed to a range of factors including heightened public awareness, clearer labelling on food packaging, and more local authorities offering residents separate food waste collection.

WRAP chief executive Marcus Gover said:"This great news announced today means we are starting to wake up to the reality of food waste, but we are too often turning a blind eye to what is happening in our homes.
We are all thinking about what we can do for the environment and this is one of the most simple and powerful ways we can play our part. By wasting less food, we are helping to tackle the biggest challenges this century - feeding the world whilst protecting our planet.
However, while the most significant drop in household food waste since 2010, WRAP's latest annual citizen survey - also released today - found that despite more of the public being aware of the issue of food waste, less than half of the population (39%) connect wasting food at home with the impact this has on the environment.
Based on self-reported estimates for the most commonly wasted foods (potatoes, bread, chicken and milk) it appears around one in three people would still be classified as being high food wasters.
While the UK is a global leader in tackling food waste and supporting international food waste prevention projects, WRAP wants the UK to go further, faster.
The organisation will continue to work closely with governments, businesses and citizens to address this throughout 2020; including the launch of a bold and far-reaching public campaign to ignite a national food conversation and complement the work of Love Food Hate Waste.
