MGNREGA guarantees at least 100 days of employment to adults of every rural household.
MGNREGA's budgetary allocation for the current year is just Rs 61,500 crore. The revised estimates for 2019-20 was Rs 71,001.81 crore. The total budgetary allocation last year was Rs 60,000 crore.

A NREGA advocacy group NRGEGA Sangharsh Morcha (NSM) told media before the budget that every financial year, funds of the scheme dry up and around 20 per cent of its budget is used to clear arrears of the previous year.
