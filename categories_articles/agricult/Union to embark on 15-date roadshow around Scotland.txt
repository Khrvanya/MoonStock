Union to embark on 15-date roadshow around ScotlandNFU Scotland is embarking on a 15-date policy roadshow tour of Scotland, with every farming and crofting member encouraged to attend.
Starting on Thursday, November 7 in Castle Douglas, the tour will take in Dingwall, Thurso, Kirkwall, Irvine, Inverurie, Perth, Broadford, Benbecula, Stornoway, Lerwick, Tarbert, Oban and Carfraemill before finishing at Stepps near Glasgow on Wednesday, December 4.
One member of the union's officeholder team - president Andrew McCornick or vice presidents Charlie Adam and Martin Kennedy - will be at each meeting accompanied by director of policy Jonnie Hall.
Speaking ahead of the roadshows starting in two weeks' time, Jonnie Hall said: "Politics and policy are rapidly shaping our industry's future at a time when farming and crofting face unprecedented physical and financial challenges.
From convergence, Brexit and future support to climate change and supply chains, every sector of Scottish agriculture faces a period of significant change.  At the same time, Scottish agriculture must also make the most of any new opportunities.
"Our priority is to secure a prosperous future for Scottish agriculture and all that it underpins.
