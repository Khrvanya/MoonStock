Use of sexed semen ‘increased rapidly’ in NI dairy herdsSexed semen technology has been constantly evolving over recent years - and its use in Northern Ireland dairy herds has increased rapidly as a result, according to the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise (CAFRE).
Relative conception rates for sexed semen, when compared to conventional semen, has been claimed to be around 90%.
Thus, if conception rate to conventional semen is 40%, conception rate to sexed would be 36%, according to Alan Hopps of CAFRE.
A recent Teagasc trial found that a small number of herds actually achieved better conception rates with sexed semen than conventional, the CAFRE dairy advisor cited.
According to the Northern Irish educational authority, some of the main points around achieving better conception rates with sexed semen are as follows:

Sexed semen should be thawed and handled more carefully;
One straw of semen should be used at a time if there are multiple animals to be served;
The use of sexed semen on known problem breeders or cows that have had difficult calvings should be avoided;
Animals to be bred should be restrained prior to thawing of semen;
Sexed semen performs better when used around 18 hours after oestrus (peak heat), compared to about 12 hours for conventional semen. Heat detection monitors are now installed on many farms and these can help to better predict optimal timing of AI with sexed semen;
The use of sexed semen should be prioritised on maiden heifers. These animals will be the best genetics in the herd and will have higher conception rates when compared to cows.Relative conception rates for sexed semen, when compared to conventional semen, has been claimed to be around 90%.
