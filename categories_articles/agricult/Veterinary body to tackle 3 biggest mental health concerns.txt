Veterinary body to tackle 3 biggest mental health concernsA UK body has committed to tackling three of the veterinary's biggest mental health worries - online abuse, self-harming and eating disorders.
Mental health is a topic of growing importance around the world and the problems surrounding it continue to grow each year.
It comes as new research has shown that out of all the rural professionals they work with, UK farmers are most likely to turn to vets for help with stress and mental health issues. But the veterinary profession is not without its own troubles.
It has been said that one in four people in the general population will experience mental health issues each year. By 2030, there will be an estimated two million more adults - in the UK alone - suffering with mental health problems.
Veterinary industry and mental health
Sadly, mental health problems are something which the veterinary industry knows all too much about.
According to Vetlife, there is evidence of higher levels of psychological distress in the veterinary profession along with anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts compared to the general population.
In countries where research has been conducted, this has been seen to be true.
AgriLand this week, spoke to Lisa Quigley, Mind Matters manager, who highlighted the fact that vets are up to four times more likely to die by suicide than members of the general public.
The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) Mind Matters Initiative has organised a free series of webinars over the next three months, in an attempt to raise awareness of the on-going problems around mental health among veterinarians.
The series comprises of three webinars, which will look at issues such as cyberbullying, eating disorders and self-harm among the veterinary profession - areas of significant importance in the line of work.
Each of the one-hour webinars will be hosted by professional development website The Webinar Vet and takes place at 12:30pm on the given date.
The webinar titles and dates - in the order of which they occur - are listed below:

Thursday, March 26, 2020 - Navigating online complaints and cyber-bullying;
