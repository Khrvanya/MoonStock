Water levels at Whaley Bridge brought down 6mWater levels continue to fall as the operation to pump away water from Toddbrook Reservoir in Whaley Bridge continues.
An update from the Environment Agency this morning (July 6), said that more than 6m of water had been removed from the Derbyshire reservoir so far.
A multi-agency team is also working around the clock to ensure the stability of the dam wall.
Part of the concrete spillway collapsed during floods caused by late last week. Further north, hundreds of acres of farmland in the Yorkshire Dales were also destroyed as heavy rain caused flash flooding across the UK.

New Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers was among those to visit the response teams working at the reservoir.
She was joined by Emma Howard Boyd who chairs the Environment Agency and also spoke to senior officials such as the chief executive of the Canal and Riverside Trust, Richard Parry; Derbyshire police incident commander Inspector Adam Wilkins; and RAF Squadron Leader John Plenty - who briefed them on the current measures being undertaken to fix the dam.
Measures include the use of RAF Chinook to drop over 400 sandbags, and the use of pumps to remove excess water from the reservoir.

While in Derbyshire, the Secretary of State also visited the Rest Centre at Chapel-en-le-Frith school, where she met with residents who have been evacuated from their homes.
The school is being used as a community hub for some of the 1,500 people who were evacuated.
Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers said: "My thoughts are with the people who have had to leave their homes.
Having spoken to some of those evacuated, I know how difficult this situation is for them and I pay tribute to their patience and fortitude. It's been wonderful to see the community support and spirit in Whaley Bridge.
"I want to thank all emergency services, military personnel, Environment Agency and volunteers for their continued hard work. I am confident that everything that can be done is being done and I've seen a reassuring amount of progress today."
Environment Agency chairman Emma Howard Boyd said: "Visiting Whaley Bridge today it was amazing to see the pure dedication of the teams at work here. Not just those in the Environment Agency - of whom I am immensely proud - but the numerous other organisations that are working tirelessly to keep the community safe.
Real progress has been made, and after seeing our pumps and the RAF Chinooks at work, I am confident we are doing all we can to lower the water levels and secure the dam.
All teams on-site continue to work to ensure the structural integrity of the dam and a progress update will be made in due course. The Environment Agency continues to monitor the flood risk closely.
