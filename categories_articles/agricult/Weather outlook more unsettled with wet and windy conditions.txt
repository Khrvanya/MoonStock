Weather outlook more unsettled with wet and windy conditionsThe weather is set to become much more unsettled in the coming days compared to the past week, according to Met Eireann.
In its national forecast, issued today (Friday, March 1) Met Eireann predicts wetter and windier conditions at least until the middle of next week.
Today will be generally dry during the morning, but rain will gradually spread across the country from the west, clearing into the Irish Sea early tonight.
Today will also be generally cloudy, with highest temperatures of 10deg to 13deg and light to moderate southerly winds.
Tonight, then, will be mostly dry and clear; however, by morning, rain will develop along the west coast as morning approaches.
Tonight will see lowest temperatures of 3deg to 6deg, and freshening southerly winds.
The turnaround in weather conditions will be complete by tomorrow, Saturday; persistent rain and wind will predominate in the morning.
That rain will turn to showers during the afternoon, but the wind will remain; winds will be southerly in the morning, and westerly later in the day.
