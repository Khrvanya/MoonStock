Welsh farming unions join forces to hold General Election hustingsWales' two farming unions - NFU Cymru and the Farmers' Union of Wales - have come together to host a series of agricultural husting events ahead of the upcoming UK General Election.
The events will ensure members of both organisations have the opportunity to quiz public office hopefuls on their positions on rural affairs, trade, and farming matters.
A joint statement from the organisations read: "In a period of political uncertainty, where our future trading relationship with the European Union remains unclear, this is an important opportunity for every farmer to quiz their prospective member of parliament on how they view the way forward.
With much of the debate centred on national and international issues, these events are also an opportunity for our farming members to engage with the candidates about some of the more local issues that affect their livelihood and community.
"We would encourage members of the farming community to take up this opportunity to pose questions to those that seek to represent them in the next parliament at Westminster."
