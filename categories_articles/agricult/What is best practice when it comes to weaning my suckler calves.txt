What is best practice when it comes to weaning my suckler calvesAs we move into the back end of 2019, most spring-calving suckler herds will be looking to sell calves at sales over the coming months.
However, before this can happen, farmers must wean calves from their dams in the near future, and it is important that these calves are healthy and looking well on sale day.
Currently, grass is still plentiful on most farms; however, grazing conditions have become tricky in some parts of the country and this has to be managed.
Many herds will not begin weaning until October, so now is a good chance to get geared up for the stressful process.
Firstly, making sure calves are free from parasites and lungworm is very important - a dose should be given where needed.
In addition, creep grazing calves in front of the cows from now until weaning will give the calves access to the best-quality grass; calves can be allowed to graze ahead by simply lifting the strip wire.
