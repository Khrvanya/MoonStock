What kind of animal feed products are we importingThis week AgriLand published figures on some of the obvious commodities that are imported into Ireland for animal feed, but there are many more products imported that you might not think of.
4,035,029t of animal foodstuffs were imported in 2018, while 3,056,791t were imported in 2017. That's a 32% increase in imports of animal foodstuffs to the Republic of Ireland in 2018.
By-products of food processing account for many of these animal foodstuffs. Some of these ingredients are obvious like beet pulp and by-products of brewing and distilling, can be seen in the picture above, but more are a little less ordinary.
A list of some of these products is outlined below. They range from waste from the sugar industry from countries like Egypt and Switzerland; to oil, cake and solid residues from palm nuts or kernels from Indonesia and Malaysia; to vegetable waste from Argentina and Hungary.
