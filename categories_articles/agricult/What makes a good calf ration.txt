What makes a good calf rationWith calving commenced on many farms in recent weeks, the importance of correctly feeding the newborn calf cannot be underestimated.
Colostrum is extremely important in the early hours of life, while a good-quality milk replacer - fed at the correct rate - is vital when it comes to giving the calf the best start.
In this article we look at the importance of a calf ration. Whether these heifers will be the backbone of the herd in the future or whether the bull calves will go on into a beef system, the calf ration is essential.
The ration is very important for the physical development of the rumen. Speaking to AgriLand, Joe Naughton - a calf husbandry specialist with J. Grennans and Sons - outlined the importance of this feed.
"It should be introduced at day four or five and it should be kept fresh at all times, keeping it in front of them all the time.
"As a general rule, farmers will introduce a coarse ration initially to get calves started, but farmers sometimes find that there is better intakes on a calf pellet or nut; the nut could be introduced at two-to-three weeks," he added.

When choosing a ration, Joe highlighted that looking for cooked material is a good option. However, these materials can be more expensive.
