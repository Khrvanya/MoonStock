What should I do if my milk has been contaminated with antibiotic residuesCalving is in full swing on spring-calving dairy farms across the country and although the management of the newborn calf and freshly-calved cow must be a top priority, farmers must not forgot about the possibility of having antibiotic residues in the milk.
Contamination of milk with antibiotics is a serious food safety matter - Teagasc says - and milk processors have stringent penalties if milk supplies are found to be positive for residues.
If you suspect any cows have been milked into the bulk tank by mistake, notify your processor immediately to avoid contaminating a full silo of milk.
Avoiding Antibiotic Residues
When it comes to avoiding antibiotic residues in early lactation, Teagasc says farmers must pay very close attention to drying-off and treatment dates; calving dates; and the manufacturer's instructions for the products used.
Top tips to avoid antibiotic residues in early lactation:

If a cow calves before the minimum dry period has passed, then you must continue to keep her milk out of the tank until the minimum dry period - plus the milk withholding time - has passed;
Keep colostrum and transition milk from all freshly-calved cows out of the bulk tank. Milk produced from the first eight milkings should be held out of the tank - whether cows have received a dry cow treatment or not;
If you suspect an error in cow identity, treatment or calving date records, Teagasc says, do not put the milk in the tank until the issue is resolved.Contamination of milk with antibiotics is a serious food safety matter - Teagasc says - and milk processors have stringent penalties if milk supplies are found to be positive for residues.
