What’s the difference between feedlot and regular herdsThe different regulations and procedures between feedlot and non-feedlot herds when it comes to an outbreak of bovine TB has been outlined by Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine Michael Creed.
Responding to a parliamentary question on the matter from independent TD for Roscommon-Galway Michael Fitzmaurice, the minister gave a breakdown of the Department of Agriculture procedures in place.
Minister Creed noted that when TB is disclosed in any type of herd, a number of measures are enforced.
The infected herd:

Is immediately restricted and cannot sell animals on the open market;
May move animals direct to slaughter;
Must isolate the reactor animals from the rest of the herd;
Must remove reactor animals to slaughter within 30 days of disclosure;
Must disinfect the premises; and
Must undergo two clear herd tests, 60 days apart, in order for the restriction to be lifted and to allow open market sales to resume.Responding to a parliamentary question on the matter from independent TD for Roscommon-Galway Michael Fitzmaurice, the minister gave a breakdown of the Department of Agriculture procedures in place.
