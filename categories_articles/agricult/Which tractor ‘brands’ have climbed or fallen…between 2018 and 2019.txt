Which tractor ‘brands’ have climbed or fallen…between 2018 and 2019A 'European dealer satisfaction survey' for 2019 - first published by AgriLand on Thursday, November 21, turned up some interesting findings; in which major tractor manufacturers (brands) were effectively ranked against several criteria.
Also Read: Which tractor brands are ranked the best and worst...in 2019?
There was also an aggregate (overall) ranking, which pitted the big brands head-to-head.
The data is from a CLIMMAR survey. CLIMMAR is a network of farm machinery dealer organisations across much of Europe.
The survey encompassed participating dealers from 10 countries. Over 1,000 respondents reportedly took part - up significantly from the last such survey in 2018.

In this follow-up article, we look at how the rankings of the major brands (manufacturers) changed between 2018 to 2019. Specifically, we note which brands climbed the rankings...and which fell.
Overall results
To recap, for overall (average) dealer satisfaction Fendt was the highest-ranked manufacturer (14.4% - across all combined criteria).

'Brand image'
Among the individual criteria (that contribute to the overall ranking), perhaps the single most important was 'brand image and impact'.
