Why is it important to give cows an adequate dry periodMany spring-calving dairy farmers have - or should have - begun to dry-off cows; however, usually during this time of year some farmers are temped to milk cows on, with a common phase being: 'But sure she is still milking well'.
However, cutting corners on the dry period can prove more costly in the long term.
Moreover, where farmers have fully-housed yields will have dropped significantly by now. If cows are only producing 10-12L/day, or less, the added work and supplementation required needs to evaluated against the potential output or return.
Risks associated with 'milking on'
Every cow needs an adequate dry period, before she calves again and starts her next lactation.
A dry period is recommended for the following reasons:

To allow cows to build up body condition for calving and the next lactation;
To regenerate mammary tissue in preparation for milking again;
To optimise the benefits of hormonal changes that occur around the time of calving.However, cutting corners on the dry period can prove more costly in the long term.
