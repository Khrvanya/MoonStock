Why should I be milk recordingMilk recording results could be used to predict methane emissions and dry cow tube requirements in the coming years, through research conducted by Teagasc.
Of course, there is an on-going discussion amongst farmers; and between farmers and their advisers; around the whole topic of milk recording.
However, many farmers are uncertain as to the reasoning behind milk recording and what the benefits really are.
Dairy farmers are either on the fence when it comes to milk recording; proactively milk recording; or are occasionally milk recording when it suits.
Milk recording should be carried out - at least - four times over the milking season. These should be spaced out evenly; with the first recording usually taking place in early April or January in the case of winter milk herds.
Benefits
Some farmers are of the opinion that the only advantage accruing from milk recording is the identification of high somatic cell count (SCC) cows; when in fact it is useful for so much more.
Uses of milk recording results:

Track your best and worst producers;
Detect high-SCC cows and control your herd's average SCC;
Useful as a culling tool;
Add value to your herd through improved herd records;
Increase compensation in the case of a positive TB result.Of course, there is an on-going discussion amongst farmers; and between farmers and their advisers; around the whole topic of milk recording.
