Why this Co. Cork farmer will not return to twice-a-day milkingFarming in west Co. Cork, six miles outside Clonakilty, Declan and Louise White and their four children (aged 11-17) milk a herd of 250 cows once-a-day (OAD).
Heading into their seventh season, Declan outlined - to the large number of farmers who attended the Teagasc OAD milking conference in Co. Tipperary earlier this week - his journey when the decision was made to switch to twice-a-day (TAD) milking.
The farm stretches across 117ha; 85ha of which encompasses the milking platform. Two outside silage blocks are located 1.5 miles from the milking platform. These are also grazed during the shoulders of the year.
In addition, 7ha of fodder beet is grown on the grazing platform and this is also grazed at the shoulders of the year by the cows.

Declan also employees half a labour unit on the farm - Denis, who Declan speaks very highly of.
Denis has worked on the White's farm for eight years and is an essential 'cog on the wheel'. He works on the farm until lunchtime everyday and all two-man jobs are carried out before this time.
Occasionally, Denis works longer due to the heavy workload at certain times of the year.
Why OAD and cow type?
In 2012, with an eye on April 1, 2015, Declan was in expansion mode; however, he admitted that this was at an accelerated rate.
"There was only one reason that OAD milking came into our heads and that was superlevy."
In September 2012, after learning how little quota was available until quota abolishment, the decision was made not to milk the cows that evening. Declan has not looked back since.
Declan's herd consists of cross-bred cows and prefers a "low-maintenance cow that will calve to grass, with a high-fertility rate and one that will look after herself over the course of the year".
The plan of attack for 2019 is to milk 250 cows, carry 60 replacement heifers and rear 100 replacement heifer calves putting 30-40 of these calves on the market after their first summer.
