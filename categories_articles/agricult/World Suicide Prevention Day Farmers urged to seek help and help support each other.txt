World Suicide Prevention Day Farmers urged to seek help and help support each otherAgriculture carries the highest rate of suicide above any other occupation. Today, on World Suicide Prevention day (Tuesday, September 10), the Farmers' Union of Wales is urging those going through a tough time to seek help.
FUW president Glyn Roberts said: "Poor mental health is an issue that affects the farming community greatly and it is well known that loneliness and social isolation can lead to mental health problems.
"The FUW understands that failing to deal with poor mental wellbeing could have serious consequences and lead to the farm running inefficiently, a serious injury, relationship breakdowns, poor physical health and even worse, it could lead to suicide."
Being part of the solution
Roberts explained that everyone can make a contribution in preventing suicide, and added that by joining together, those suffering can be better supported.
"Suicidal behaviour is universal and it knows no boundaries," he said.
It can affect anyone and therefore we all have a role to play to collectively address the challenges.
"Of course, preventing suicide often requires the efforts of many, like family, friends, co-workers, community members, educators, healthcare professionals, and governments.

"We must remember that every life lost represents someone's partner, child, parent, friend or colleague. For each suicide, there are countless other people who suffer intense grief.
So if you feel like your world is crashing down on you and you can't cope any longer, or you know someone who is vulnerable - please seek help immediately.
"We will continue to shine a light on the consequences and causes of poor mental health in our farming communities and help to not just break the stigma but to make changes to legislation and attitudes so that we can continue to see a thriving, sustainable, happy, farming sector in Wales."
