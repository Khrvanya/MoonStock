‘Irish organic sector will be driven by market opportunities’ – DoyleThe Irish organic sector will be "driven by market opportunities", the Minister of State for Food, Forestry and Horticulture at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Andrew Doyle, has stated.
Speaking yesterday (February 13) at the launch of BIOFACH - a global event for organic food held in Nuremberg, Germany - the minister highlighted the potential for developing the organic sector in Ireland.
This year's event is expected to bring together up to 2,500 exhibitors and 52,000 trade visitors from over 130 countries. The Irish stand - hosted by Bord Bia - has nine Irish companies exhibiting.
The event was opened by Minister Doyle. As he addressed the crowd, he said: "The importance of BIOFACH to food producers and the market cannot be underestimated.
"It offers Irish organic producers the opportunity to showcase their products to a global audience.
This event shows that Irish companies, with high-quality organic products, are amongst the best in the world.
He then went on to mention the importance of the new seven-year strategy, for the organic sector, launched last week: "This strategy really highlights the opportunities for the Irish organic sector for the year 2025 and beyond.
