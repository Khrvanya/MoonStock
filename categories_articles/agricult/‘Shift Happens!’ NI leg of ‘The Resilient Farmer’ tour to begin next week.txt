‘Shift Happens!’ NI leg of ‘The Resilient Farmer’ tour to begin next weekWith just a few days to go until the Northern Ireland leg of 'Shift Happens! - An Audience with The Resilient Farmer' tour kicks off, Rural Support is urging farmers and members of the farm family to attend one of the tour dates.
Jovially dubbed 'The Resilient Farmer', New Zealand farmer Doug Avery has been praised around the world for his unique approach to farming, the environment and mental health.
After years of spiralling debts, drought and depression, Avery managed to turn his 5,900ac farm into one of New Zealand's most successful farm businesses, picking up several awards on the way.
He documented his experiences in a book, also titled 'The Resilient Farmer', which has sold more than 18,000 copies worldwide.
Avery said: "I will be sharing details of my experience and the journey to where I am now with the hope of inspiring members of the farming community to look at their own approach and to challenge and teach processes of building a more resilient mind.
"To embrace shift and view change as an opportunity - to see that it is our valleys that create our next journey to the peak - and learn the tricks of managing the depths of our valleys."
Jude McCann, Rural Support chief executive, said: "The timing of this tour could not be more appropriate.
Farmers continue to face challenges in relation to finances and debt, poor market prices, rising costs, increasing workloads and the uncertainty of Brexit.
"No doubt these challenges have a toll on the mental and physical wellbeing of our farmers and farm families and indeed impact upon family relationships.
