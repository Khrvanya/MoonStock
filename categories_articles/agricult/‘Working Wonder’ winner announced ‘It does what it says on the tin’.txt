‘Working Wonder’ winner announced ‘It does what it says on the tin’The winner of the six short-listed 'Working Wonders' that featured at last week's Farm Tractor & Machinery Trade Association (FTMTA) Farm Machinery Show - as part of a country-wide competition - has been announced.
A tractor belonging to the Bailey family (pictured below - receiving their prize) from Gorey, Co. Wexford, received the most votes at the event in Punchestown.

Bob Bailey's son Ben told AgriLand that their Fiat (Fiatagri) 160-90 DT was bought brand new from Kelly's of Borris, Co. Carlow, way back in 1994.
The tractor is now semi-retired and spends its evenings distributing feed rations to cattle (with a diet feeder in tow). Previously, it was a "general-purpose workhorse".

During past harvest seasons, the 'Italian stallion' was kept under pressure driving a beefy Hesston 8X4X4 big square baler. It also pulled a 4m-wide Cousins press/roller during the sowing season.

Speaking before the event, Ben explained: "We reckon there are about 28,000 hours on it. The clock is showing 8,000 hours, but it only reads up to 10,000 and relapses - so it's gone around twice."
Concluding, he remarked: "She gives no hassle; it does what it says on the tin."
The Baileys have now won EUR3,000 worth of tyres - kindly sponsored by FTMTA member firm AgriGear (based in Bailieborough, Co. Cavan).
They were handed the (tyre) voucher by AgriGear's Fred Clarke at the show.
It's worth noting that the Bailey family, who are involved in agricultural contracting, are members of the FCI (Association of Farm & Forestry Contractors in Ireland).
