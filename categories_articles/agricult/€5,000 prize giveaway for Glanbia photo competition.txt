Also up for grabs is a pallet of GAIN calf feed (42 bags). The winning entrant can choose from any one of GAIN's calf feed range, each optimised for steady growth and performance of your calves at each stage of their development.
There will be 10 runner up prizes to be given away also.
Safety Comes First
When taking a photo of livestock, always remember that safety comes first. Please be extremely careful when taking your CalfLife images.
Remember to be very careful around calves when cows are present; animals can be unpredictable so take your shots from behind a gate or barrier. Even the quietest cow can attack if she feels her calf is in danger.
How the competition works
There will be two rounds in the competition with five winning entrants being picked from each.
These will qualify to the final where the winning entrant will be picked by a public vote from the top 10 entrants.
So get snapping and sending and the very best of luck to all entrants!
