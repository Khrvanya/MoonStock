376 Crypto Whales Hold 33 Percent of Ether, Chainalysis FindsA recent study by Chainalysis revealed that only 376 people are holding one-third of Ether.This makes the digital currency of the smart contracts leader more centralized than Bitcoin, as only little more than 20 percent of the leading digital asset is controlled by so-called crypto whales.Discover Barcelona Trading Conference - A Top Tier Crypto Trading EventAccording to the New York-based blockchain analytics firm, although a handful of individuals control 33 percent of Ether, the concentration of the coin went down significantly since 2016, when whales held 47 percent of the coin.The company defines "whales" as "the top 500 holders" of cryptocurrency. However, it excluded the custodian services which store the vast amounts of crypto holdings of exchanges.Despite the concentration of the cryptocurrency, its effect is limited to the price of the asset. "These whales have no meaningful impact on the price of Ether; they do, however, make the market more volatile on a daily basis with their large sell-offs," the company explained.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>The study elaborated that the whales largely hold the digital currency and account for between five to eight percent of economic transaction volume of Ether.Furthermore, market data collected from 2016 to 2019 revealed that the value of Ether tends to follow the price movement of Bitcoin. "On average, a 1% increase in Bitcoin prices yesterday leads to a 1.1% increase in Ether prices today," Chainalysis stated.However, the movement of funds by these whales impact the intraday volatility of the market."On average, a whale that sends 1 million USD worth of ether two days ago leads to a 0.1 unit increase in intraday volatility today, which is relatively small considering values of intraday volatility range from 0.02 minimum to 417 maximum," the analytics company added.Recently, the former CTO of TRON revealed that the project has deviated from the principles of decentralization and its voting process is being controlled by a handful of people."We cannot rule out the possibility that whales can impact price changes within single days based on outlier events," Chainalysis concluded.
