Founded by two industry veterans - Howard Atkinson and Fred Pye - in 2012, 3iQ is a regulated Canadian investment fund manager with a multi-crypto asset investment fund."We are very honored that an Investment Fund Manager of the magnitude of 3iQ chose our solutions to be the technology behind their Digital Securities Offering and their company," Jofre added."Moving to Digital Securities is a very important decision in the history of our company, and we need a protocol that is secure and robust, while never compromising compliance," Atkinson, who is also holding the position of chairman at 3iQ, said. "We believe KoreConX is not only the right choice when it comes to the Digital Securities Protocol, but also when it comes to management after issuance."Last month, the Canadian crypto fund manager appealed to a decision of Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) which forbids the issuance of a receipt for the final prospectus of The Bitcoin Fund.KoreConX, earlier this year, partnered with InvestReady to offer its verification services.
