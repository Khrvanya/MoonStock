Earlier this month, the platform extended its borrowing support with BTC as collateral, only a week after it received two operating licenses in Estonia.One license grants the company to provide a wide variety of exchange services and solutions for cryptocurrency users, including converting fiat to crypto, crypto to fiat, and crypto to crypto transactions, while the other allows it to offer cryptocurrency wallet services.
