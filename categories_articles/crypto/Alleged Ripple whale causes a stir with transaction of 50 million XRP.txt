Alleged Ripple whale causes a stir with transaction of 50 million XRPThe Twitter account Whale Alert observed once again a huge XRP transaction yesterday. An XRP whale sent nearly 50 million XRP tokens (49,999,995 XRP) from an unknown address to the Luxembourg based cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp. The XRP tokens were worth over $11.5 million at the current trading price. The sender's address now contains only 25 XRP, probably to keep the XRP account active.  49,999,995 #XRP (11,669,366 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #BitstampTx: https://t.co/IIaFsmiBqB-- Whale Alert (@whale_alert) January 28, 2020The transaction provoked numerous negative comments and caused a lot of attention. Most expected a sell-off and a fall in the XRP price. Some said that they were ready to "buy the dip". The reactions were not surprising at all, but rather just dismayed at the likelihood of another sell-off.As Whale Alert recorded, the relevant XRP were transferred from an unknown wallet. However, data from XRP Explorer Bithomp indicates that the wallet belongs to the crypto-custody service provider BitGo. BitGo had announced in early October 2019 that it will take over the secure storage of the cryptocurrencies managed by Bitstamp. At that time Bitstamp declared:The security of our clients' funds is always a top priority for Bitstamp. With BitGo Custody, Bitstamp's assets are 100% secured by cold storage technology in banking-grade Class III vaults and protected by BitGo's $100 million (USD) insurance policy.Thus the all-clear can be given against a possible "dump" of XRP. The fact that the wallet belongs to BitGo suggests that the transaction is a routine relocation of assets. In addition to the Bitstamp transaction, the XRPL Monitor recorded two other large transactions yesterday, amounting roughly to 15 and 30 million XRP, respectively.Transaction Type: PaymentAmount: 15,000,000 XRPFee: 12 drops (0.000012 XRP)Sender: rBrMQL7hU3cdtw8U9ohJrrxA89e4HNqJpeSender Balance: 13,430,196.138528Receiver: rKGdHodbBEVckTFTrrnTqwhVp5NHPrTL7kReceiver Balance: 15,000,069.976915Link: https://t.co/9GnXAVOUXQ-- XRPL Monitor (@XRPL_Monitor) January 28, 2020Transaction Type: PaymentAmount: 20,519,000.447636 XRPFee: 10 drops (0.00001 XRP)Sender: coinoneSender Balance: 30,778,182.119803Receiver: coinoneReceiver Balance: 71,815,758.279565Link: https://t.co/AZVzrM78wx-- XRPL Monitor (@XRPL_Monitor) January 28, 2020The transaction of the 15 million XRP worth around $3.5 million was sent from the crypto exchange Binance to another wallet activated by BitGo.
