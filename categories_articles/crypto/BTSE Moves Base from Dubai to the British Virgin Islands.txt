By September 2018, we had finalized the paperwork for two entities and proceeded to integrate banking solutions to power our fiat on- and off-ramps," the official announcement added.Now it's pointing out the failure of Dubai lawmakers' inability for concrete progress in bringing crypto regulations and decided that "continuing BTSE's operations under the existing framework would not be feasible in the long term."Similar to Dubai, BTSE also pointed out the lapse in bringing frameworks in other jurisdictions, specifically Malta, which once promoted itself as crypto heaven.
