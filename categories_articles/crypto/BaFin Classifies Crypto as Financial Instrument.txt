It also clarified that it would not penalize any unlicensed entity already offering such services. These firms only need to show their intention to obtain such a license by March 31 and apply for one by November 30.According to a local report, more than 40 German banks are now seeking BaFin's approval to offer digital asset custody services in the country."According to the wording of the regulation, it is not necessary that crypto values   or private cryptographic keys that are used to hold, store or transfer crypto values   are stored, managed and secured at the same time," BaFin stated (translated from German)."For the purposes of this provision, custody means taking the crypto values   into care as a service for third parties. This primarily includes service providers who store their customers' crypto values   in a collective inventory without the customers themselves being aware of the cryptographic keys used."
