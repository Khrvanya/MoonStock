No user intervention will be required. Funds will not be affected."Beam is one of the few cryptocurrency projects that are based on the Mimblewimble protocol, which aims to solve the privacy and scalability issues of Bitcoin.Unlike most cryptocurrencies, Mimblewimble-based coins do not have a wallet address. The user only holds a set of keys that control the unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). For every transaction, the user creates two new outputs - one to send the desired amount of crypto and the other to store the balance. The key to the first address is shared with the other party involved in the transaction.The Israel-based company launched its token earlier this year, which almost tripled its value since last month. The project also attracted the attention of investors and raised an undisclosed amount from Japanese recruiting platform giant Recruit even before its mainnet launch.
