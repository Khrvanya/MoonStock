Binance to Launch Margin Trading “Soon”Binance has confirmed that it plans to launch margin trading for its clients in the near future.The world's second largest cryptocurrency exchange appears to have revealed the news by accident.Discover the Barcelona Trading Conference - A Top Tier Crypto Trading EventJust after midnight on Friday morning, the exchange operator posted screenshots of a 'light mode' and 'dark mode' on its Twitter page, asking its followers to say which they preferred.Viewers of the two images quickly realized, however, that the two screenshots - which were of the main page on the exchange's trading platform - also showed a margin trading mode.As you can see from the image below, along with the exchange tab, there is another page available that is titled "margin."
