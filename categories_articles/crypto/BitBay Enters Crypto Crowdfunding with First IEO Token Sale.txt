BitBay Enters Crypto Crowdfunding with First IEO Token SaleFollowing in the footsteps of Binance's Launchpad, BitBay is presenting its own version of an Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) platform, which administrates crypto crowdsales on behalf of the startup that seeks to raise funds with its newly issued tokens.A blockchain firm called QANplatform, which says it builds an energy-efficient platform that relies on a new protocol, will be the first project to hold an initial exchange offering on BitBay's Launchpad platform. The IEO sale of QARK tokens will go live on November 18, and BitBay is billing the token sale as the first to allow investors to buy IEO tokens directly through Euro, Polish Zloty and GBP.London Summit 2019 Launches the Latest Era in FX and Fintech - Join NowSuggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>As it stands, IEO encompasses a cryptocurrency exchange hosting third-party token sales on its platform, which allows potential projects to tap into the venue's user base and reach a wider audience. On the other side, the crypto exchange guarantees transparency since it enforces identity verification for all participants and thus helps protect investors from ICO scams.Although there are similarities in the sale process for tokens listed through different IEO platforms, compared to Binance, questions remain as to whether token sales launched on BitBay will have the same kind of success. Demand on Binance's launchpad has been extreme, given the massive user base, with some IEOs having sold out in minutes. This led the world's most active crypto exchange to introduce a lottery-like system, where participants must have a certain amount of its native token, the BNB, in order to qualify."Our IEO Launchpad has been created to provide investors with an all-in-one-place solution. We deliver the complete information about a project, as well as offer a simple process for buying tokens with both crypto and different FIATs (PLN, EUR, GBP, USD). By bridging this gap, even novice investors and no-coiners can participate in the sale," explains Pawel Sobkow, CEO of Pinewood Estonia OU, a BitBay platform operator.
