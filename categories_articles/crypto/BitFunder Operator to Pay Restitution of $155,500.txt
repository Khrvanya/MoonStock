When they were done, the cyber attackers had made off with 6,000 bitcoins - a sum that was at the time worth around $775,000.Instead of alerting the authorities to the hack, Montroll did not reveal what had happened to his clients. Instead, he tried to return client funds using his own money.However, Montroll's attempts did not work, and a couple of months after the cyberattack, BitFunder users began to experience difficulties withdrawing funds from the site. Not long after that, he shut the site down.
