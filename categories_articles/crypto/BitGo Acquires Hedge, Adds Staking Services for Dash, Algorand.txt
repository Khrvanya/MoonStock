Staking provides our clients with returns on their investments without ever moving their assets out of custody."The new service was added with the acquisition of Hedge, a startup working on the scalable and programmatic deployment of staking infrastructure. However, neither of the companies disclosed the terms of the deal.The crypto company already integrated Hedge's automated secure deployments, scalable and redundant processes, and the use of hardware security modules (HSMs) and secure cryptographic enclaves.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>"Our acquisition of Hedge builds on the blockchain and staking expertise within our engineering platform to deliver an automated, end-to-end staking service," Chan added.Proof of stake (Pos) is getting attention in the crypto world, as many major projects are now moving to the protocol.
