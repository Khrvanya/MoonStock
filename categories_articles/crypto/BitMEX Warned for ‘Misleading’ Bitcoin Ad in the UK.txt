Happy 10th Birthday, Bitcoin', the graph and text next to it and a full-page article written by the CEO and co-founder of HDR Global Trading Arthur Hayes titled "Two sides of the coin: the bifurcated near-future of money," it added.Although the watchdog agency agreed that the ad was "a clear promotional statement of Bitcoin's merits and did very little to warn consumers of any risks," it concluded that people viewing the ad were "likely to be misled about bitcoin's value and stability in recent years and therefore about what any investments they might previously have made would have yielded."The crypto platform, however, responded saying that the advertisement was entirely to educate the public as it does not offer buying and selling of digital currencies.BitMEX is also reportedly facing a probe in the United States by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) under the suspicion of providing services in the country.Meanwhile, in July, the platform recorded a fund outflow of $524 million, highest since the launch of the platform.
