BitWise BTC’s Daily Trading Volume is Only $272 MillionBitWise Asset Management is one of the latest firms to attempt a Bitcoin ETF proposal to the US SEC. Most of the firms who have previously tried to get a Bitcoin ETF have been denied on the grounds that Bitcoin is subject to too much market manipulation. As such, most of these applications have taken steps to prove that market manipulation on the Bitcoin network isn't a major issue.Bitwise, however, seems to be taking a different approach. Rather than outright denying that market manipulation is a problem, Bitwise acknowledged it directly in a report that was presented to the SEC. However, the company seemed to say that the manipulation that happens in the Bitcoin space happens in the reporting of figures rather than in the figures themselves.Discover Barcelona Trading Conference - A Top Tier Crypto Trading Event"The real market for bitcoin is significantly smaller, more orderly, and more regulated than commonly understood," the report reads. "95% of Bitcoin trading volume is fake and/or non-economic in nature."Why is this misinformation about Bitcoin trading volume so widespread?

However, the report alleged that the real average daily trading volume of the Bitcoin market is just $273 million.According to the report, this is for two reasons: first, "under-the-hood the exchanges that report the highest volumes are unrecognizable," meaning that OTC exchanges (which are the exchange medium of choice for most Bitcoin 'whales' do not report their trading volume.Separate rumors that data on CMC might be fake began circulating last year, but they were never taken too seriously by the cryptocurrency community.4/ Total daily spot volume is about $270M--95% less than reported. pic.twitter.com/kILQcqOlQR-- Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) March 22, 2019
Secondly, reported volume figures are often distorted by exchanges seeking to raise their prestige: "the vast majority of this reported volume is fake and/or non-economic wash trading," the report explained. Exchanges may be interested in reporting higher trading volumes in order to "attract listing fees (often millions of dollars) from ICOs and alt coins."BitWise explained that through its own extensive analysis of data collected on 81 cryptocurrency exchanges, only 10 had actual trading volume: Binance, BitFinex, Kraken, Bitstamp, Coinbase, bitFlyer, Gemini, itBit, Bittrex, and Poloniex.It's still unclear whether the data will cause the SEC to lean toward or away from allowing for the creation of a Bitcoin ETF.
