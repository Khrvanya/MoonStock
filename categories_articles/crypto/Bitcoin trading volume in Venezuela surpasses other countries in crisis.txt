The Venezuelan government issued this order and stated that Petro's exchange platform would go into maintenance.This measure has been in place since the beginning of 2020 and no update has been made so far. Some economists, however, have claimed that the Venezuelan government's action is due to rising inflation and the devaluation of the local currency against the US dollar.As reported by CNF, the Venezuelan government has tried to impose the use of Petro, but it has had little impact on local trade. Its difficult trade and lack of transparency have only generated distrust in the population.Bitcoin  trades at $8,655 USD, at the time of publication, with a very slight upward movement (2.36%) in the last 24 hours.Follow us on Facebook and Twitter and don't miss any hot news anymore!
