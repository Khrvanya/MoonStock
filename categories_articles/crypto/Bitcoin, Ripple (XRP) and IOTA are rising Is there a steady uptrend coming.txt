Bitcoin, Ripple (XRP) and IOTA are rising Is there a steady uptrend comingYesterday, Sunday 22nd December 2019, Bitcoin started a short rally. The price rose from USD 7,110 to a short-term USD 7,650. In the process, BTC broke through two resistances at 7,400 USD and 7,600 USD within a few hours. Active traders will keep a close eye on the price and wait for Bitcoin to close above 7,600 USD and then move on to the next resistance at 7,800 USD.The sudden price increase occurred over the weekend when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) was closed. As soon as the CME reopens its markets, there is a difference between the closing price and the opening price, the so-called "CME futures gap". Due to the fact that the CME only offers its cash settled Bitcoin futures during weekday trading hours, some such "CME Bitcoin Future Gaps" have been created since December 2017.As a result, a gap has also arisen at USD 7,230, which could be closed in the near future. CME gaps have almost always been closed in the past, so Bitcoin could fill this gap in the coming days. However, whether this indicator actually represents a reliable signal is controversial.The experienced Bitcoin trader Josh Rager writes on Twitter that Bitcoin could break through the Fibonacchi level of 0.786 and the price could fall to USD 7,576. In his opinion, Bitcoin will only then see a further rise in price. In addition, he believes that a reversal of the trend will not occur until Bitcoin breaks through the resistance at $8,000 and can hold for several days.IMO shorting $7400s was a crowded tradeEveryone talking about itI'm looking to short but higherPrice currently breaking through monthly open and 0.786 fib of this rangePrice could fall here but I think it pushes higher pic.twitter.com/snTMJtMXCf-- Josh Rager  (@Josh_Rager) December 23, 2019Some Altcoins were able to follow the increase of Bitcoin.

The market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies at the time of writing is 198 billion USD.The Bitcoin bulls Tim Draper and Brain Kelly agree that Bitcoin can rise to a price of USD 250,000 next year. Further acceptance and distribution will play a decisive role in this. According to Tim Draper, Bitcoin has fallen short of the community's expectations, but nevertheless shows a positive development.Ripple has identified three trends for a progressive adaptation of digital assets such as Bitcoin. There is a growing demand for mobile wallets that allow customers to do everything in one place. In addition, the demand for credit and loan offers is growing in developing countries. This will also lead to further expansion and acceptance. Tourists will also benefit in the long term from the use of Bitcoin or XRP.Another indicator of progressive adaptation is the use of new Bitcoin financial products, such as Bitcoin Futures on the Bakkt exchange. The volume rose to a new record high of USD 110 million last week (+46% compared to the previous week) and shows a growing interest of institutional investors in the Bitcoin market.ICYMI: this week's summary of Bakkt Bitcoin Monthly Futures: Total volume: $110 million (+46%) Max open interest: $7.0 million (+11%)@Bottlepay this bot a coffee: https://t.co/MJaZ58oPiu  pic.twitter.com/wa7gMs4hLN-- Bakkt Volume Bot (@BakktBot) December 22, 2019Follow us on Facebook and Twitter and don't miss any hot news anymore!
