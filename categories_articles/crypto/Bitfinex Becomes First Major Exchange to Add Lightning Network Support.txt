It was introduced to increase the scalability of the original blockchain network by taking the transaction away from the main blockchain. The feature was functional on Bitcoin since early 2018.Mainly designed to handle micro day-to-day payments, the protocol also drastically reduces the transaction fees.Though many small blockchain companies implemented Lightning Network on their platform, Bitfinex will be the first major exchange to fully embrace the technology.In an interview with The Block, Ardoino said: "In Bitfinex, we think that it [the Lightning Network] can be the game-changer of our industry since it enables P2P micro-payments with small fees and high throughput. Its P2P nature carries the unstoppable force of bitcoin. Still, it requires more awareness, understanding, and adoption from the larger crypto community. A major exchange supporting it will speed up this adoption process."To use the newly added feature, traders need to go to the LN deposit page and create an invoice to fund their accounts.The account of the user will be credited with LNX, a proprietary digital token of the exchange, once the transfer of Bitcoin from any LN compatible wallet has been made. The LNX can be converted to Bitcoin by Bitfinex users without any premium charge.
