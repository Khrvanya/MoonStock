K.im will defer any decision on whether to create tokens on, or undertake a token issue in relation to the K.im platform until it is fully functional," Bitfinex added.The IEO has become very popular recently due to the guarantee of a major exchange for the blockchain project, which otherwise is missing from initial coin offerings( ICOs). Bitfinex also jumped into the lucrative sector and launched Tokinex in partnership with its former sister platform ETHfinex. However, after the split of ETHfinex, Bitfinex retained the IEO platform and rebranded it.The announcement also detailed that K.im is now likely to hold an equity-based director to private investors to raise money for the project."In the meantime, the K.im platform project itself will continue and it is likely that an equity-based offer will be made sometime in the near future to qualifying investors who wish to become involved at this stage of the project," the exchange added.
