"We really love LN (I personally do a lot), so we want to make sure we learn and contribute to it with our resources,"According to The Block, Bitfinex has had intentions of working on launching Tether on the Lightning Network for quite some time.

At press time, Tether was the ninth-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap. Tether's competitors-USD Coin, Pax, Gemini dollar, and TrueUSD operate on the Ethereum network.The announcement of the initiative is perhaps a bit of positive news after a bout of bad press. For weeks now, Bitfinex and Tether have been embroiled in a dispute with the New York Attorney General's office. Both companies are under fire after it was revealed that Tether loaned a significant amount of its reserves to Bitfinex to cover the exchange's losses.Serious though it is, the dispute doesn't seem to have done any serious damage to the companies (yet)-Tether's market cap is currently at a new all-time high at $3.14 billion.
