Tether is a dollar-pegged stablecoin issuer which maintains a currency chest of USD, equalling the number of USDT in circulation.The New York authorities were already skeptic about the business of both Bitfinex and Tether. Last November the firms were subpoenaed and ordered not to continue business in the state.The recent fillings revealed that the crypto exchange never informed its investors about the losses it incurred and accessed Tether's currency reserves to project a healthy business. So far, Bitfinex has used at least $700 million from Tether, according to the AG's filing.Countering the allegation of the New York Attorney General, Bitfinex has issued an official statement denying all the claims."The New York Attorney General's court filings were written in bad faith and are riddled with false assertions, including as to a purported $850 million 'loss' at Crypto Capital. On the contrary, we have been informed that these Crypto Capital amounts are not lost but have been, in fact, seized and safeguarded," the exchange noted.The exchange also ensured that it is a financially strong company and will cooperate with the authorities in any investigation."We are and have been actively working to exercise our rights and remedies and get those funds released. Sadly, the New York Attorney General's office seems to be intent on undermining those efforts to the detriment of our customers," it added.
