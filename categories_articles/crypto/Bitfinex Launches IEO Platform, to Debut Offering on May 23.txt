As the listings are already backed by an exchange, there is a guarantee of the tokens listing on a trading platform amid the sales. In addition, unlike ICOs in an open market, the IEO-listed projects go through rigorous scrutiny and due diligence by credible sources.Other leading global exchanges including Huobi, Bittrex, and Gate.io also jumped into the sector with their own platforms.To outrun the competition, Tokinex will not charge the blockchain companies any listing fees, which means, for generating revenue, it will only depend on maker-taker fees amid the listing of these tokens on the exchange.The new IEO platform has been unveiled at a time when Bitfinex is facing serious allegations of utilizing cash reserves of its affiliated company Tether to cover up a loss of $850 million. Since the NY Attorney General accused the crypto exchange of wrongdoings, it has raised $1 billion in a private placement for its exchange token LEO to compensate the losses incurred by Crypto Capital.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court of New York has recently ceased all cash flow from Tether to Bitfinex and asked the exchange to produce all documents related to the loan.
