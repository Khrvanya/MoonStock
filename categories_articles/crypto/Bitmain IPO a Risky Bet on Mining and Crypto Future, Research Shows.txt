But after it spent a few months to manufacture and ship its chips, the gear has slowed as lower crypto prices, and lack of miner innovation compared to its rivals, have kept orders extremely soft in 2018.The document reveals that although the company brought in more than $700 in profit during the first half of 2018, "Bitmain has been making large losses recently, with a net loss of US$395m in Q2 2018... with almost US$0.5 billion spent on failed chips in the last 18 months."Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Given the Bitmain's issues, the company closed a $442 million pre-IPO funding round from investors last month to strengthen its balance sheet.

Even though Bitmain obtained this money from investors, rather than generating it from free cash flow," BitMEX report states.Bitmain, which is based in Beijing and has offices in other cities including Amsterdam, Tel Aviv, and Hong Kong, announced in January that it intends to invest in as many as thirty startups powered by blockchain.
