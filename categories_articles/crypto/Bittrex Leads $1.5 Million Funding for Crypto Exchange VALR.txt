This makes it very difficult for crypto exchanges in South Africa to access liquidity from international markets. [South Africans] want their hands on a store of value that doesn't depreciate the way the rand has."Ehsani also said that 1,500 users, dominated by South Africans, already registered in the wait list of the exchange and also started to activate accounts in a closed beta.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Bittrex will also be involved in the South African exchange's operations as it will supply the new platform with global liquidity and competitive prices for crypto-to-crypto trading. Ehsani also revealed that the exchange is working to add fiat-to-crypto trading support on the platform.Unlike the rest of the world, cryptocurrency penetration in Africa is very low, mainly because of the sub-par infrastructure and unstable economy.The lack of supply also led to a premium pricing of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies across the continent.However, digital coins are gaining a lot of popularity among the population. According to the Global Digital Report 2019, 10.7 percent of mobile users in South Africa own cryptocurrencies.The government of the country is also trying to regulate the sector as in January this year, a jointly published paper by several South African institutions mandated registration for the crypto exchanges operating in the country."The VALR team has the potential to change the cryptocurrency landscape in South Africa and globally," Michael Jordaan, a VALR investor from Montegray Capital, told the publication.
