As well as bringing liquidity to assets that are currently illiquid and hard to trade, blockchain technology also has the potential to revolutionize traditional liquid financial markets too - particularly by bringing efficiencies and cost savings to the post-trade space.""Whilst looking for seed investment, we were keen to find partners who understand what tokenization can bring and that could add real value to the Archax business. Lewis and the team at Bletchley Park deliver exactly that," he added.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Rodford is also going to join a panel discussion in the upcoming Barcelona Trading Conference.
