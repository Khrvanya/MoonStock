Their stance has remained unchanged for years. Recently, however, important announcements have occurred in state of New York. First, Fidelity Digital Assets received a license to tarde Bitcoin. Now BlockFi launched its platform by going through a registration system. The company had to classify itself in a special category and then turn to the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.So far, BlockFi's expansion has been successful. It remains to be seen how these events will shape the future outlook. A change of position in the United States and its institutions would be great news for the entire ecosystem. For now, voices worried that the United States will lose its financial leadership, such as Ripple's CEO, seem justified. Companies like BlockFi's will bring more capital into the market in the future. However, they could also go to countries with a loose regulatory policy and a legal framework that is more relaxed towards trading crypto markets.Follow us on Facebook and Twitter and don't miss any hot news anymore!
