I have witnessed first hand the growing demand for high-quality insight into the traditionally opaque and misunderstood area of cryptocurrency, which led me to create Cryptoindex. Our index takes into account collective sentiments expressed on social media, in addition to complex data analysis of volume trades and predictive analytics."Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>The crypto index only considers digital currencies that maintained their position among the top 200 currencies for three consecutive months. In addition, to qualify for indexing, the digital assets need to be listed in multiple crypto exchanges and should have a "significant social media following."In addition, the Malta-registered company uses a proprietary algorithm called Zorax to analyze tens of millions of trades across nine crypto exchanges. According to the company, the algorithm analyzes 1.200 coins and incorporates over 33 Terabytes of data to extract over 200 factors.Meanwhile, other companies are also developing crypto pricing products to serve the needs of investors. Earlier this week, Finance Magnates reported that CryptoCompare and Nasdaq partnered to launch an institution-focused crypto pricing product on Quandl, a Nasdaq-owned financial data platform."They are also subject to existing regulations and as such are proving very expensive on margining due to the high volatility of the market," Angelo added. "There are also a number of crypto exchanges offering crypto derivatives, however, these aren't always regulated. As a result, there is an opening for a properly designed and executed set of crypto derivatives in the market to meet institutional requirements. Cryptoindex will look to meet this need in the not too distant future though the precise timing isn't yet agreed internally."
