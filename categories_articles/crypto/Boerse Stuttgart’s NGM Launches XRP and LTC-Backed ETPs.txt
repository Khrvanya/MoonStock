Swiss stock exchange SIX recently announced the listing of a similar XRP-backed product. That was the fourth digital asset-backed product of the exchange as it already operates three crypto-tracking ETPs."This is first and foremost a win for investors, especially those in Sweden who have demonstrated such strong support of prior crypto offerings," Tommy Fransson, deputy CEO of NGM added."As an industry, it is important for us to listen, though with caution, to the requests of our investors and respond in kind. We are very excited to be part of making history here with the first ever LTC and XRP tracking products; and look forward to continuing to collaborate closely with XBT Provider on behalf of investors interested in new offerings."
