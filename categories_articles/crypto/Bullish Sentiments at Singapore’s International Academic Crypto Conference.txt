"In conjunction with the third Singapore FinTech Festival, it features specially commissioned studies that can contribute to formalising a framework for analysis. A robust understanding of the implications of digital currencies will inform policies pertinent to central banks and regulators."Academics speaking at the conference have presented several arguments in favor of digital currencies. Professor David Yermack argued that the introduction of a private digital currency could promote economic welfare by reducing incentives for government-induced inflation and by providing an opportunity to diversify local investments. His sentiments were echoed by Professor Berry Eichengreen of the Berkeley Department of Economics, who argued that "while the centralised control of monies has rarely been complete, the bias towards concentration of currency issuance in the hands of a central government is clear."Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Famed economist Kenneth Rogoff, who also spoke at the event, presented a slightly different view. According to a government report on the first day of the event, Rogoff said that "digital currencies may have a future as regulated, central-bank issued currencies, rather than private ones."In late September, reports emerged that Singapore is determined to become the first country to "fully embrace" cryptocurrencies. The Monetary Authority of Singapore published a "Guide to Digital Token Offerings" last year, in which a clear legal structure was established for token sales.Of the report, Damien Pang (Head of the Technology Infrastructure Office under the FinTech & Innovation Group (FTIG) at the Monetary Authority of Singapore) said that "The MAS takes a close look at the characteristics of the tokens, in the past, at the present, and in the future, instead of just the technology built on."It doesn't aim to regulate technology itself but [its] purpose."
