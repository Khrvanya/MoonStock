For the US offshoot, the company has received Money Transmitter Licenses in nine states.CEX.io had received a money service business (MSB) status with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) back in 2015, which allows a company to act as a money transmitter in the United States with the stringent independent annual audit. However, the service was restricted to residents in states where MTLs are not required.The news follows similar moves by other cryptocurrency venues such as Huobi and Bittrex which launched a purely crypto trading service for the US. It also comes on the heels of Binance's decision to launch a dedicated platform in the US through a partner entity dubbed BAM Trading Services, a FinCEN-registered company. But Binance goes a step further, setting aside American users from trading on Binance.com.Oleksandr Lutskevych, CEO and founder of CEX.IO, commented: "We are thoroughly working in each and every market to apply for and receive all the necessary licenses, comply with AML requirements, establish partnerships with local payment processors and banks, and cooperate with regulators in order to drive crypto adoption."
