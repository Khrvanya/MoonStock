However, the demand for such contracts remains much lower than the expected trading volume."Building a new futures market is hard and we have been hugely successful with $1.3bn (EUR1.19bn) of bitcoin futures traded in May," he added. "We have already delivered on milestones and the introduction of options will help develop the ecosystem."
