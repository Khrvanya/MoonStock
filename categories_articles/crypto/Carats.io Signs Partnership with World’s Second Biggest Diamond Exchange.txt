This means that it will act as a neutral third party between those selling diamonds to Carats.io - specifically, companies that operate in jurisdictions where such transactions are legal - and Carats.io itself, which issues CARAT tokens in exchange for the stones.Carats.io had been linked with the Israel Diamond Exchange, but that partnership ended recently because Israel's diamond regulator did not grant Carats.io a licence to trade in diamonds, according to Reuters. Following this, the startup partnered with  a blockchain-based financial platform called Celcius.IDEX, or International Diamond Exchange, is regularly used by 7,000 professional diamond traders and 1,500 diamond supplying companies. It has 750,000 diamonds in its online pool, according to the press release.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Eli Avidar, President of Carats.io, told Finance Magnates that after leaving the IDE "a whole new world opened up for us," with its data pool of diamonds growing 30-fold as a result of its new partnerships.
