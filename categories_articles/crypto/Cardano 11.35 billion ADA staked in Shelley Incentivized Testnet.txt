Cardano 11.35 billion ADA staked in Shelley Incentivized TestnetCardano has launched the Shelley Incentivized Testnet in preparation for the Haskell Testnet, so that all developers and other stakeholders can pilot key functions in a secure test environment and check for errors. The launch in December last year went surprisingly well, with more than 240 stake pools already formed within the first 48 hours and over 5.4 billion ADAs delegated, almost 17 percent of the total supply.The SIT now has more than 15,232 active users and 1046 stake pools have already registered. Of these, 672 count as active because they have delegated at least one ADA. In total, almost 11.35 billion ADAs have been staked and delegated so far. The community has been significantly involved in several tests of various bugs and has provided valuable feedback to the developers.Source:https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/02/07/shelley-incentivized-testnet-story-in-numbers/A user describes:I had a smooth learning, I was new to Linux but everything [for setting up a stake pool]went smooth and was fun.Hoskinson describes that Cardano is to become the most decentralized crypto currency in the world as soon as all technical milestones of the roadmap have been completed:
