Late last year, the start-up acquired a $4.2 million Series A round led by Credit Suisse and including Innogy Ventures.ScanTrust's technologies have been used for some time to track the supply chain and protect against counterfeiting by a variety of companies. Many of ScanTrust's customers are large Western companies, such as Unilever, Dow Chemicals and ABInBev who want to protect their brands in China. The company has also worked with Hyperledger.ScanTrust considers the blockchain to complement and improve traceability, transparency and trust but not as the core business. The extent to which Cardano fits into this concept and what the proof of concept is about in detail will be announced in the next few days.Furthermore, a cooperation with the Berkman Klein Center of the renowned Harvard University became publicly known. The Cardano Foundation has approved an application for a research grant from the Berkman Klein Center to "study blockchain governance". The research is intended "to benefit Cardano as well as the entire crypto ecosystem".According to the foundation, a formal announcement will follow shortly. Charles Hoskinson, CEO of Cardano, has already responded to the news and wrote:Glad to hear that Harvard University will be conducting governance research that we can use for Cardano's Voltaire release.

However, we are still on that journey and are hopeful that leveraging IOHK's world-leading expertise, particularly in third generation blockchain technology, will help us to progress even further toward our goal of being the world's leading country for secure, digitally-enabled international business.At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.04648 and has seen an increase of approximately 33 percent over the past 30 days.Follow us on Facebook and Twitter and don't miss any more hot news!
