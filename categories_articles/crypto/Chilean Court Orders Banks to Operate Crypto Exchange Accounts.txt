Chilean top officials, including the country's Minister of Finance, Felipe Larrain, Minister of Economy, Jose Ramon Valente, and the president of the country's banks association, Segismundo Schulin-Zeuthen, will also attend the court's hearing.After the suspension of bank accounts last year, BUDA's co-founder and CEO Guillermo Torrealba said: "They're killing an entire industry. It won't be possible to buy and sell crypto in a safe business in Chile. We'll have to go back five years and trade in person. It seems very arbitrary."
