Most of its major mining companies and cryptocurrency exchanges moved overseas.However, apparently it had missed quite a few.Pan Gongshen, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, said in December: "If things were still the way they were at the beginning of the year, over 80 per cent of the world's bitcoin trading and ICO financing would take place in China - what would things look like today? It's really quite scary."Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>According to Reuters, the government is also working on new laws to govern peer-to-peer internet finance in a more general sense, as at least 243 lending companies have gone out of business since June. Many people have lost their life savings, and demonstrations have taken place.According to Caixin, WeChat said in a statement that it banned cryptocurrency-related accounts because they had provided forbidden services - namely cryptocurrency trading and ICO fundraising. According to CoinTelegraph, one of the newly-blocked sites had more than 100,000 users in June 2018.Then on Friday last week, WeChat Pay, the company's payments service, decided to completely block cryptocurrency transactions. Following that, AliPay, the country's largest payments company, followed suit, reminding its customers "not to be deceived by various false propaganda, to recognize the risks of virtual currency transactions, and to avoid the possible losses suffered."HoIy shit, just spoke with someone based in Beijing who told me that the reason why these crypto media outlets got shut down is because they reported on the vaccination scandal that bypassed censorship via the Ethereum blockchain. This is WILD. (https://t.co/vGkcUBNs3z)-- Katherine Wu (@katherineykwu) August 21, 2018
