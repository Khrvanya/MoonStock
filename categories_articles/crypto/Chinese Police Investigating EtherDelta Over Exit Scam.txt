Built on the Etherum blockchain, it allowed the listing of any ERC-20 tokens. It allows users to trade cryptocurrency without the need to register an email or password - in fact, people do not need to sign up at all.Last year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged the founder of the decentralized exchange for operating an unregistered securities exchange. Coburn was eventually slapped with a fine of $300,000 in disgorgement, with another $13,000 in pre-judgment interest and a $75,000 penalty.Wan pointed out that, unlike the US where Coburn got away with only a fine, "Chinese police shows no mercy if any crypto scam involved large amount of retail capital."
