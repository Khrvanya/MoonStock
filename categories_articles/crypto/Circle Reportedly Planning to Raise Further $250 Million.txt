However, according to reports, the platform's revenue was hit by the slow down in the crypto market.Circle last year also jumped into the lucrative business of stablecoins and introduced a dollar-pegged digital currency called USDC. Unlike its primary market competitor Tether, the US-based firm adopted a transparent approach and, since the launch of the coin, the company is posting monthly audited reports of its currency chest backing the dollar-pegged currency.The approach turned out to be a huge success for the company as major crypto exchanges showed interest in making the coin as their base currency.To survive the wrath of the "crypto winter," many crypto-based businesses are opting to raise funds with a lower valuation. However, the publication could not reveal Circle's estimated valuation with the target funding.
