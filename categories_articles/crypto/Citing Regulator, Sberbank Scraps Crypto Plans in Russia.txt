Citing Regulator, Sberbank Scraps Crypto Plans in RussiaA leading executive at Sberbank said on Thursday that his company is scrapping its cryptocurrency plans.Speaking to reporters in Moscow, global markets head Andrey Shemetov said that steps taken, or perhaps not taken, by authorities meant the banking group has put the brakes on its cryptocurrency plans.Discover the Barcelona Trading Conference - A Top Tier Crypto Trading Event"Regarding cryptocurrency, we waited for legislation that allows you to trade cryptocurrency," said Shemetov. "Since the regulator is currently looking negatively [at digital assets], we decided to suspend our cryptocurrency plan."The Central Bank of Russia has made mixed noises with regard to cryptocurrency.
