We're excited to be working with Polkadot and Web3 Foundation to offer dot holders the most secure and efficient tools for managing tokens and staking."Last year, the US exchange revealed that it is also planning to add DOT tokens on its trading platform, among several others.All the token claims made before the launch of the blockchain by the investors, including via Coinbase Custody, will be added to the genesis block of the blockchain, the announcement detailed.Coinbase's platform will also allow DOT holders to earn interest by stalking their coins. Moreover, they can also participate in an on-chain governance system to coordinate protocol upgrades and fixes."With Polkadot genesis fast approaching, we are focused on supporting high quality integrations to ensure that Polkadot is easy to use and dot holders are secure. I can't think of a more trusted name in crypto than Coinbase to be supporting Polkadot from block zero," Kasper Mai Joergensen, CFO of Web3 Foundation, said.
