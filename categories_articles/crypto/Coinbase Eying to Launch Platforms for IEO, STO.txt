Though similar to ICOs, IEOs are backed by major crypto exchanges, meaning the projects undergo rigorous scrutiny and vetting before the fundraising attempt. It also guarantees a listing on a major exchange, which facilitated the token sale.Popularized by Binance, most of the major crypto exchanges including Bitfinex, OKcoin, and Kucoin now offer a platform to conduct token sales. Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck is also considering to jump into the IEO industry.To pave its way to offer securities in the US, Coinbase received approval for the acquisition of three companies last year - Keystone Capital Corp., Venovate Marketplace and Digital Wealth LLC - which granted it broker-dealer licenses.Per Pirestani, STOs have received a lot of attention in the industry. However, the trading volume associated with them is still less. To play safe, the US-based exchange will wait for more market demand for STOs.
