It already has ties with Coinbase as the exchange bought insurance with coverage up to $255 million to secure its hot wallets.Due to the lack of insurers in the market, many crypto platforms are self-insuring themselves by creating rainy day funds to cover possible losses. However, as these funds are not regulated, the management often gets tempted to utilize them for other purposes.Jessie Powell, the CEO of Kraken, earlier revealed that the exchange set aside over $100 million to protect its clients' stored funds against losses or hacks. Singapore-headquartered Huobi also revealed that it has 20,000 Bitcoins stored in reserve fund to protect the claims of its clients in case of any theft.Though neither Coinbase nor the London-based insurer officially admitted anything, an executive from Aon confirmed Coindesk that it helped in creating a captive insurer earlier this year for another crypto-based company.
