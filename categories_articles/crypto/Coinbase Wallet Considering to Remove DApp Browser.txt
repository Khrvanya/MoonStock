Apple seems to be eliminating usage of Dapps from the App Store" Armstrong noted. "If Apple customers want to be able to use Dapps, we may need to make this request know to Apple in some way."DApps are getting very popular in the crypto space, and developers are bringing such applications for a range of fields - gaming to gambling - on major blockchains. Multiple exchanges and wallet platforms have integrated support to these DApps to attract more clients to their platforms."This is an important area of innovation in finance, and many developers and early adopters of this technology have millions of dollars worth of crypto tied up in these financial applications, which they will no longer be able to use on Apple mobile devices if this app store policy continues," the CEO added.Though Coinbase Wallet provided access to Dapps for a long time via its mobile application, it added similar support for desktop browsers in August through the WalletLink service.If the exchange decides to remove the functionality from mobile applications, users would still access the DApps service through WalletLink.Coinbase's decision came days after the removal of the mobile client of MetaMask, an Ethereum wallet and decentralized application (DApp) platform, by Google from its Play Store. Though the tech giant cited violations of its financial services policy by the blockchain platform, it even refused an appeal against the decision.
