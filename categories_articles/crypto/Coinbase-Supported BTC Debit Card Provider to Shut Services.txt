The card was issued by the Metropolitan Commercial Bank and could be used in both VISA and Mastercard payment networks. With the boom in the market in 2017, multiple providers issued Shift-based debit cards in various countries.The company, however, did not reveal any reason behind the shocking move. Many Reddit users are citing VISA and Mastercard's plan to increase transaction fees for US merchants as the primary reason for the shutdown.Although a convenient option to use cryptocurrencies in day-to-day activities, crypto debit cards attracted a lot of skepticism as well.
