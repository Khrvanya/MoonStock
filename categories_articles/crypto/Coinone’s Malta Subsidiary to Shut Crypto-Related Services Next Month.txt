It also integrated Coinone's operations in South Korea and Indonesia. The opening of the exchange in a jurisdiction like Malta was viewed as Coinone's backup plan to avoid any crackdown on crypto in South Korea.The announcement of the termination of CGEX's service came two months after the suspension of crypto trading services on the platform. The exchange then suspended services including deposits, canceled active orders, and also disabled APIs.Though the exchange then assured that the suspension was not permanent and it would relaunch in the third quarter of this year, it is now shutting down completely.Meanwhile, a recent local media report claimed that 97 percent of South Korean crypto exchanges are on the verge of bankruptcy due to the low volume of transactions.
