The orders belonging to these customers were only settled after the halt was lifted and the BCH price had already spiked, which caused substantial losses to the plaintiffs. The court added that Coinbase's negligent launch impacted traders in "the dysfunctional market," who suffered "an ascertainable pocketbook injury."The complaint was filed by Coinbase user Jeffrey Berk, representing all customers that placed buy, sell or trade orders for BCH at the time of launch. He alleged that Coinbase employees and others with knowledge of the matter benefited from trading on the basis of non-public information.According to the filing, Coinbase listed the newly forked BCH without notice, and shortly after trading opened, the price of BCH skyrocketed by over 130 percent. When rumors emerged that Coinbase employees were tipped off about the launch, suspicions of insider trading immediately began to spread.
