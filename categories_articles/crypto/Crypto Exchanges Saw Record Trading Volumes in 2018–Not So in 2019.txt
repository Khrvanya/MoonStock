According to Diar, BTC miner revenues were over $5.8 billion in 2018, with $1.2 billion in earnings in January alone.By December, however, monthly earnings had shrunk to just $210 million.Throughout this decline in revenue, Diar reports that there was also a major reorganization of "hash power," or the computational power used in the process of mining.In January of last year, Bitmain and its mining pools along with the ViaBTC mining pool (which Bitmain had holdings in) controlled over 53 percent of the hash power on the BTC network.Now, these companies control just 39 percent of Bitcoin's hash power. That missing 14 percent has reportedly been redistributed across a number of smaller mining pools-a factor that actually makes the Bitcoin network far more decentralized, and thus more secure as a whole.Indeed, "unknown miners closed December having solved a whopping 22 percent of the total blocks up from 6 percent at the start of last year," the report read."The Bitcoin network is currently less likely to experience an attack given the fact the BTC.com controlled pools have lost dominance over the network."Diar has researched and tracked a number of other important shifts in the cryptocurrency markets throughout 2018. In December, Finance Magnates reported that Diar found a 97.5 percent in ICO revenue throughout 2018.Previously, in October, Diar reported that 70 percent of ICO-backed companies were worth less than when their ICOs were completed."And with tokens having no equity representation, markets have shrugged off cash-on-hand as part of an enterprise valuation," the report said. At the time, TokenData founder Ricky Tan told Diar that recovery was unlikely anytime soon.
