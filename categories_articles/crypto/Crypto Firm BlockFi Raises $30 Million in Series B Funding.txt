The crypto startup is also offering a 3.8 percent annualized rate on Litecoin deposits, as part of its offering for interest-bearing accounts.While BlockFi is advertising its annualized returns paid in Bitcoin or Ether, according to the product's terms and conditions page, the company can modify the rate each month at its sole discretion.The startup pays crypto deposits interest rates from 4 to 12 percent. However, the actual interest rate is set on a month-to-month basis and is based on a combination of rates BlockFi sees in the institutional cryptocurrency borrowing market."At BlockFi, we believe that access to wealth-building financial products shouldn't be limited by geography or net worth. With this investment, we're one step closer to realizing that vision," said Zac Prince, CEO and co-founder, BlockFi."For most people, cryptocurrencies are something out of speculative fiction. Adoption of these assets is limited by the average consumer's ability to understand how to use them," added Flori Marquez, VP of operations and co-founder of BlockFi.
