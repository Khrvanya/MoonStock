Crypto Firm Diginex Goes Public on Nasdaq Through Reverse MergerHong Kong-based Diginex, a blockchain and digital services platform, has closed a 'reverse merger' deal with 8i Enterprises Acquisition Corp to go public on Nasdaq. This so-called reverse merger is a nonconventional way of getting into the public markets and could be much faster than an IPO.According to an announcement published Wednesday, Diginex has recently closed a $276 million share exchange deal with 8i Enterprises, which trades publicly on the US major exchange under the ticker JFK. This effectively makes Diginex a publicly listed firm without filing for an initial public offering (IPO) or meeting stiffer listing requirements.Discover the Barcelona Trading Conference - A Top Tier Crypto Trading EventDiginex CEO Richard Byworth said this transaction would increase their broader market visibility as the company plans to further roll out its global platform which includes exchange infrastructure, product offering, licenses and market expansion into key geographies around the world.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Diginex operates mining operations in Asia, Switzerland, and Sweden and has offices in Hong Kong, Switzerland, Germany, and Japan.

Former hedge-fund manager Mike Novogratz also used the same tactic to list his crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital Holdings on a Canadian stock market.
