"Defendant breached that duty by providing legal advice, opinions, and services that fell below the standard of care of an ordinary, reasonable lawyer."Now, the plaintiffs are seeking compensatory damages for its loss, which includes incurred fees and costs, damages for reputational loss, and lost profits along with other consequential damages. They are also demanding restitution of all attorneys' fees paid to the law firm.
