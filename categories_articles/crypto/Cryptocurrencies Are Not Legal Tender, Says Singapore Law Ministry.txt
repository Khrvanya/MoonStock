"This would include consideration of the risks posed by non-cash - for example, crypto currency-based - transactions," a spokesperson from the ministry said."Therefore, businesses which choose to accept cryptocurrency payments should ensure that they have sufficient measures in place to mitigate potential money laundering and terrorism financing risks, which may arise from these modes of payment. In addition, businesses should perform their due diligence before accepting cryptocurrency payments, as cryptocurrencies are not legal tender."The Singaporean authorities have been concerned about illegal transactions in the precious stones market for a while. Last week, the ministry introduced a bill to tighten money laundering and terrorism financing rules in the precious stones and metals industry. The bill also covered the concerns with the digital asset payments and proposed a complete framework for them.
