The total market cap went down from its peak of $827 billion to $112 billion despite the addition of hundreds of coins in the meantime, according to Coinmarketcap.com.

In January 2018, when the market was hovering at its peak, the firm's co-founder Tom Lee predicted that, by 2022, Bitcoin might touch $125,000. Weeks after that when the asset gained a downward pace, a new high above $19,000 within five months was predicted by Lee.Bitcoin's dropping value has also made it very difficult to continue its mining. According to a recently published JPMorgan Chase report, it takes $4,060 to create one Bitcoin, which is much above the market price of the token.According to Sluymer, smaller coins are at more risk compared to Bitcoin."A break below the fourth-quarter lows at $3,100 would imply a decline to $2,270, while a move above $4,200 is needed to signal Bitcoin is beginning to improve," he added.
