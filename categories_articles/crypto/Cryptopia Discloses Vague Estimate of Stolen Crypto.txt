The report surfaced on January 15 as the exchange announced that a "significant" amount of cryptocurrencies were stolen from the exchange and assuring that the New Zealand police is investigating the matter.The lack of any official figure put blockchain analytics firms to work with one such company estimating that the exchange has lost $16 million worth of ETH and other ERC-20 tokens. Elementus also claimed that the hackers were dumping the stolen digital tokens on various major exchanges including Bitbox, Binance, Huobi, and HitBTC and looking to cash out.A few days later, the same analytics firm again claimed that the attackers continued to siphon funds from the exchange while the case was under investigation. This time the loss was estimated at around $175,000, and the report also claimed that 17,000 wallets of the exchange's users were affected.In the recently posted update, the exchange has assured that it is "securing each wallet individually" to ensure the security of the platform.Update: We are securing each wallet individually to ensure the exchange is fully secure when we resume trading.
