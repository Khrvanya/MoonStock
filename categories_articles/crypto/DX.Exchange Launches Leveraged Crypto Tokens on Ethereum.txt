Therefore, SLT traders do not incur overnight interest and do not face as much risk as in normal margin trading.Turbo tokens also have a compounding mechanism that prevents the value of the asset from ever going to zero, which (according to the announcement) means that traders "never face more risk than the loss of their original investment." The tokens can be stored in an ERC20 token wallet.Daniel Skowronski CEO and Co-Founder of DX.Exchange, said that SLTs are a "game-changer:" "Exchanges are in a race to add leverage products, but they are still tied to the old school of margin trading with high risk and fees," he explained.As Finance Magnates reported earlier this year, DX.Exchange partnered with MPS MarketPlace Securities, Ltd, to be the first exchange to offer tokenized stocks of some of the largest publicly traded companies in the world."We have been waiting to go live with the most upgraded, inclusive, and modern version of our exchange platform," Skowronski said at the time. " The industry is very dynamic, and with new and exciting products such as digital stocks making their grand entrance, we're confident that the hard work to perfect the trading experience was well worth the effort."
