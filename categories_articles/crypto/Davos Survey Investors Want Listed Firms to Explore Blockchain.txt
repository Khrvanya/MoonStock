Increasingly, the winning organizations of the future will be those that have a clear and comprehensive strategy for blockchain and those that are committed to implementing and using it to transform their organizations," said Sandra Ro, CEO of the GBBC, while speaking at Davos."It is perhaps not surprising that investors will soon want to know what companies are doing in this area, and that they have confidence in the executives chosen to implement the programmes."Though many of the investors and executives are bullish about the technology, the same cannot be said for Bitcoin and other digital assets.At a CNBC-hosted panel at Davos, Jeff Schumacher, founder of BCG Digital Ventures, said "I do believe it will go to zero. I think it's a great technology but I don't believe it's a currency. It's not based on anything."Schumacher's statement is odd considering his investments in many blockchain-based companies."I am much less interested in investing around bitcoin as a currency unit or a currency equivalent, or even the blockchain as an accounting ledger. I am thinking much more about the protocols. In other words, what is the underlying protocol going to do as a consequence of which, which tokens are valuable or not," said Glenn Hutchins, chairman at North Island.
