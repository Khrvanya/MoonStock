It depends on how the countries' government values the specific asset class - if they viewed it as [a] store of value then property classification or if they viewed as [a] medium of exchange then currency or commodity classification is right."Appropriate categorization of digital assets will also decide the accurate purview on these assets, CoinDCX chief pointed out.Citing the regulatory attempts of many countries, including the United States, Japan, and the European Union, the lawyer also argued the baseless decision of the RBI to ban digital currencies because it cannot regulate them.He also pointed out that the efforts of the crypto exchange to curb illegal activities like money laundering and terror financing by mandating the know-your-customer (KYC) process."Due to [the] presence of stringent regulation measures such as KYC/AML etc., it has helped us in tracking and curbing down any bad practices," Gupta remarked on mandatory KYC. "This is the reason, mandatory KYC and other necessary regulatory measures are important for clamping down illegal activities on on-ramp fiat-crypto exchanges, as most of the illegal activities are still carried out in fiat currencies."The apex court heard the arguments of the crypto lawyer for three straight days, and will now resume the hearing on Tuesday for further arguments.Whatever may be the final judgment, the decision will surely make a huge impact on the crypto industry as a whole.
