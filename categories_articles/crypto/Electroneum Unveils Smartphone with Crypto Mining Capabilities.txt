Electroneum Unveils Smartphone with Crypto Mining CapabilitiesElectroneum, a UK-headquartered blockchain company, has launched an $80 Android-based smartphone capable of cryptocurrency mining.Dubbed as M1, the smartphone is Google Mobile Services (GMS)-certified and comes with a cloud mining technology integration enabling users to earn crypto through an app, according to the official announcement published on February 25.Asia Trading Summit - The Leading Investment Event in ChinaStarted in 2015, Electroneum offers an app-based cryptocurrency mining facility on smartphones. Its app can be downloaded just like any other app from PlayStore or AppStore, and the users can start mining the platform's native digital coin on their smartphone.At the launch of the smartphone, users can mine only Electroneum's native token ETN, and once the setup is complete, the mining can also be done offline.However, it is to be noted that the phone itself is not mining any cryptocurrency as the power-hungry process would drain the battery in minutes. The firm confirmed that the app only provides a "mining simulation" on the phone and the earned tokens are airdropped accordingly.Mentioning the launch of M1, the company's founder and CEO Richard Ells said: "With our experience in tech, we were able to gather a world-class team consisting of telecommunications, manufacturing, emerging area mobile-operators, product design, and marketing specialists, all helping to make this utopian vision of ours a reality.""Without the broad range of talent and expertise, we could never have imagined the possibility of making a product of this caliber accessible for anyone in the world, and we are extremely proud of the result."Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>The inexpensive smartphone did not cut short much in the specs sheet as its M1 is bundled with a 4G modem, 8 GB of internal and 32 GB of expandable storage, and two SIM slots.
