However, the exchange did not pay the employee his share of the commission.The crypto exchange, however, has denied all allegations made against it. A Kraken spokesperson told Bloomberg: "[Silverman] is both lying and in breach of his confidentiality agreement."Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Apart from the breach of contract, the ex-Kraken employee also alleged that the exchange is violating regulatory guidelines by continuing its operations in New York."[The exchange had been] misrepresenting to the public and government regulators that it was not operating in New York; when in reality, Kraken's OTC practice, and OTC trading (including logging into the Kraken exchange and negotiating wire transfers) occurred almost exclusively in New York," the court filing states.Kraken, in 2015, shut down its services in the state of New York amid the introduction of the controversial Bitlicense. Powell later slammed the mandatory license calling it a "foul" and "cruel" creature."Just because some people in the cryptocurrency space don't believe the rules apply to them doesn't mean that's the way things actually work," David Silver, an attorney of the ex-Kraken employee, told the publication.Silverman's suit is not the first against Kraken, as another similar lawsuit was filed against the crypto exchange earlier this year by another employee. In that case, the employee sued the exchange for not paying him an agreed upon sum of $907,631 in settlement money.
