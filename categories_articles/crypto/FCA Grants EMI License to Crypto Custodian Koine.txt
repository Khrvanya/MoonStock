According to the firm, it serves over 40 institutions, funds, and family offices.Though headquartered in London, the company's crypto custody and settlement services are "outside the UK regulatory perimeter," and thus, the "e-Money authorization should not be read as authorization of Koine's transformative custody and settlement model for digital assets."Earlier this year, Finance Magnates reported that the company acquired Recruitable Ltd, aka Hireabl, a fintech company working on the automation of client on-boarding."The FCA's recognition of the controls and processes that we have put in place for our EMI authorization, notwithstanding their concerns regarding the digital markets, shows that London can continue to attract financial institutions in the digital markets, alongside traditional capital markets, as long as those institutions can show that they have appropriate governance to address the regulator's requirements," Hughes added.
