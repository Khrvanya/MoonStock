FINMA Declares Envion AG’s $90 Million ICO ‘Illegal’The Swiss financial market regulator has declared that the initial coin offering (ICO) of crypto mining firm Envion AG is illegal and "seriously violated supervisory law."The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), in an official notification published on March 27, mentioned that via its ICO the Swiss mining company raised more than CHF 90 million (around $90.3 million) from more than 37,000 investors in early 2018. However, the company failed to follow the necessary statutory licensing requirements.Discover Barcelona Trading Conference - A Top Tier Crypto Trading EventFounded in 2017, Envion AG was developing "mobile crypto mining units" involving clean energy.

This, however, requires a banking license."However, it is not clear yet if the company, already in the liquidation process, will start refunding its investors or not.Last week, the Swiss parliament approved a motion ordering the Federal Council to start adapting the existing legislation for digital currency regulation.
