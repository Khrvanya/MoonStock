As Finance Magnates reported, the deal terms include FTX's involvement to build out the liquidity and institutional product offerings across the Binance ecosystem, including its global exchange and over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk.The derivatives exchange also grabbed headlines last year when a $150 million lawsuit was brought against it for market manipulation and selling unlicensed securities in the US. Allegations were also made that the manipulations were done by Binance, which the vocal head of the exchange denied. The charges were dropped by the court last month due to insufficient evidence.With the volatility in the spot market, crypto options contracts became very popular, and major exchanges are betting big on the arena. Along with Huobi and OKEx, Binance also dived into the sector, along with the launch of its futures platform.
