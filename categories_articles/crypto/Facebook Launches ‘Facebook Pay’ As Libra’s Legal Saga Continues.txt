"Facebook Pay will make these transactions easier while continuing to ensure your payment information is secure and protected."The blog post also says that the platform is "built on existing financial infrastructure and partnerships."Mike Isaac, a Tech Reporter at the New York Times, echoed this statement in a Tweet:fwiw a lot of the payments infrastructure is already in place across FB, Mssenger and Instagram so this is kind of a knitting together of a lot of existing things. kind of a branding exerciseSuggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>(adding this to WA will be a big deal -- WA and IG to come in the future)-- rat king (@MikeIsaac) November 12, 2019The new service will at first be available to users in the United States starting this week for "fundraisers, in-game purchases, event tickets, person-to-person payments on Messenger and purchases from select Pages and businesses on Facebook Marketplace."While the product's official launch came on the 12th of November, whispers that Facebook may have been developing an official payments platform began on Twitter as early as September, when Twitter user and renowned app vulnerability discoverer Jane Manchun Wong came across a Facebook Pay transaction page.I've never seen "Facebook Pay" before. Is this a rebrand or a new service?-- Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) September 13, 2019"I've never seen 'Facebook Pay' before. Is this a rebrand or a new service?" Wong asked in a Tweet.Notably, the launch of Facebook Pay comes weeks after every major US-based payment processor that originally signed on as a backer to the project made the decision to pull out; namely, Visa, PayPal, Stripe, and Mastercard. eBay, Mercado Pago, and Booking.com also pulled out of the project.However, according to CoinTelegraph, Visa CEO Alfred F. Kelly has said that Visa is still in talks with Facebook regarding Libra.
