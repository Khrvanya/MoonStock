Both these Trojans are executed every minute to collect user data.All the collected information is then uploaded to a remote server from where the attackers scrape the data.The attackers are cautious enough to delete every piece of data from the victim's computer, leaving behind a directory of empty folders.Moreover, to directly steal cryptocurrencies, the Trojans automatically replace the attacker's crypto wallet address on the clipboard when it detects the victim has typed in a cryptocurrency wallet address.The report recorded a few addresses substituted on the victim's clipboard which consists of wallet addresses of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, DOGE, Dash, Litecoin, Zcash, Bitcoin Gold, QTUM, and Ripple.The address associated with Bitcoin holds around 33 BTC worth $253,238 at current market rate. However, it is not confirmed that the coins were collected from scamming users.Crypto platforms and users are very lucrative targets for cyber scammers to attack with malware. Last month, Finance Magnates reported that the developers of notorious crypto jacking malware Shellbot updated it to not only mine crypto remotely but also to shut down host's ongoing mining activities to utilize more processing power.Another Trojan was discovered earlier this year, which was targeting Android devices to steal cryptocurrencies and fiats.
