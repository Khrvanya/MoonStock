The claim was made that pool participants could get extraordinary investment returns - up to 300% in less than a week.Instead of using the investors' monies in trading, the fraudsters misappropriated all of the funds, then removed the website and social media materials and ceased communicating with customers.Separately, on the same day, the CFTC accused a Colorado businessman and his UK-registered company of violating trading regulations and defrauding at least 600 customers of more than $1.1 million.As also alleged, he used new investors' funds to pay back other investors in a Ponzi-like fashion, so that they would invest or refer additional money, thereby allowing the scheme to continue for a longer period of time.
