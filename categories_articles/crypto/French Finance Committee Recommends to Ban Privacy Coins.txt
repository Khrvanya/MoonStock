French Finance Committee Recommends to Ban Privacy CoinsIn a recently published report, the Finance Committee of France's National Assembly has proposed for a complete ban on the privacy-focused cryptocurrencies.Though the report elaborated the use of crypto assets and the blockchain technology, its introductory part grabbed the attention as the committee's president Eric Woerth showed his tough stance against the digital currencies providing anonymity to the users.Discover Barcelona Trading Conference - A Top Tier Crypto Trading Event"We must be aware of the problems that [cryptocurrencies] can pose in terms of fraud, tax evasion, money laundering or fraud, or energy consumption," Woerth noted."It would also have been appropriate to propose a ban on the dissemination and trade in [cryptocurrencies built] to ensure complete anonymity by preventing any identification procedure by design...This is the case for a certain number of [cryptocurrencies] (Monero, PIVX, DeepOnion, Zcash...) whose purpose is to bypass any possibility of identifying the holders.

These coins are based on the Mimblewimble-protocol and allow the users to set their own privacy levels."The distinction between the different uses of [cryptocurrencies] must continue, to establish a finer and more precise regulation protector of the general interest, as well as the private interest of the entrepreneurs of this domain," the president added.
