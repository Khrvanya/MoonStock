In fact, operating profit for the company was Y=21.79 billion ($196.99 million) during the year.

This lead to the firm announcing via a regulatory filing in December that it was exiting the industry at a huge loss."After taking into consideration changes in the current business environment, the Company expects that it is difficult to recover the carrying amounts of the in-house-mining-related business assets, and therefore, it has been decided to record an extraordinary loss," the filing at the time stated.Furthermore, the company expects its cryptocurrency mining division to post an extraordinary loss of Y=35.5 billion ($318 million), the filing said. Because there are no signs that the mining industry is improving, GMO will no longer "develop, manufacture, and sell mining machines." However, the company will continue in-house mining operations within GMO Internet but will relocate the mining center to another region to secure less expensive power supply.
