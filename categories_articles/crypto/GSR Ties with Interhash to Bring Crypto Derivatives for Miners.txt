Miners are a foundational component of the digital asset space, and have to consider many volatile factors when planning their future revenue streams."The crypto mining industry evolved tremendously over the years - once Bitcoin could be mined using a laptop, however, now high-end ASICs are needed to register profits. Moreover, the involvement of big players in the business also made it tough for small miners to survive in the industry.According to GSR, around $3 billion worth of Bitcoin will be mined next year."The cost of mining equipment and electricity are constantly in flux. Miners must also consider the asset's mining difficulty and price. The unpredictability of their business models is unprecedented, so it is natural that this segment of the market is exploring ways to better hedge their risk. We are pleased to help build customizable risk management solutions alongside Interhash, who are global leaders in the industry," Gil added.
