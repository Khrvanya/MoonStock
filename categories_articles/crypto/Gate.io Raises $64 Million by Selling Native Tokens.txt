Initiated by Binance, other major crypto exchanges including Huobi and Bittrex also opened their own IEO platforms.Gate.io is also set to jump into the IEO bandwagon as Tatibouet revealed that the exchange would launch a platform similar to Binance Launchpad later this week."The demand is indeed correlated with the overall market condition when exchange tokens have jumped by 150 percent in Q1. Thus retail investors' anticipation for these tokens to yield a high rate of return is still positive," Tatibouet said.
