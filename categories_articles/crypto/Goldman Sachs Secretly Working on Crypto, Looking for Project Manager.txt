He was also bullish on the future of stablecoins and tokenization.Elaborating the role of the team, Goldman Sachs noted: "Accelerate is a firmwide initiative to foster innovation and collaboration across divisions, with a focus on the firm's future growth. The projects we fund will focus on building brand new business ideas for GS, while offering employees the opportunity to work in a fast-paced, entrepreneurial environment."Though JP Morgan Chase's CEO made harsh comments against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for years, his bank became the first Wall Street giant to announce the development of a native cryptocurrency.However, unlike any other digital coins, JPM Coin will be highly centralized and confined within the bank's ecosystem.
