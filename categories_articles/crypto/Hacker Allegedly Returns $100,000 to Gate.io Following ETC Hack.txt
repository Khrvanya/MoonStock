We have raised the ETC confirmation number to 4000 and launched a strict 51% detection for enhanced protection.Discover iFX EXPO, Your Gateway to Asian Markets!See details: https://t.co/xX8cVIWdC2 pic.twitter.com/MUQX3hpMPV-- gate.io Exchange (@gate_io) January 12, 2019"We were trying to contact the attacker but we haven't got any reply until now," the post said. "We still don't know the reason. If the attacker didn't run it for profit, he might be a white [hat] hacker who wanted to remind people [of] the risks in blockchain consensus and hashing power security."A "white-hat" hacker is a hacker who uses their abilities for the "greater good" rather than personal gain or glory. However, if this attack was indeed organized by a white-hat hacker, his or her methods were certainly unorthodox-hundreds of thousands of dollars is nothing to sniff at.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Further, the exchange claims that the hacker has returned $100,000, but reported in a blog post on January 9th that $271,500 worth of Ethereum Classic tokens had been transferred out of its wallets during the attack. This means that more than $171,000 may still be at large. (Originally, Gate.io reported that just $40,000 had been affected.)In a separate statement, US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase reported that it had found that $1.1 million in cryptocurrency had been affected throughout the attack. Originally, Coinbase issued a report saying that $460,000 was involved.On 1/5/2019, Coinbase detected a deep chain reorganization of the Ethereum Classic blockchain that included a double spend. In order to protect customer funds, we immediately paused movements of these funds on the ETC blockchain.
