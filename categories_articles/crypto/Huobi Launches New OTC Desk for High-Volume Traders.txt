We also see an unfilled need for services aimed at those looking to make large volume transactions. Huobi OTC Desk is a big step forward to filling both of those needs."The announcement also specified that traders in the United States will be barred from the new services.Huobi already operates a retail OTC desk, which is managed by its subsidiary Huobi Global and executes trades in a peer-to-peer market. However, the new institution-focused platform is processing the trades under Huobi Technology.Huobi is one of the largest global crypto exchange in the market. According to Coinmarketcap.com, the exchange is handling $2.5 billion worth of crypto trades on a daily basis - the number spiked because of the recent bull run in the crypto market.The new OTC platform is a part of Huobi's ambition to become a full-service market facilitator in digital asset trading. Keeping with the market demand, the Singapore-headquartered company also launched an initial exchange offering (IEO) platform called Huobi Prime.
