Last month, Athena, a subsidiary of CVS Health Corporation, joined the Synaptic Health Alliance to test the pilot blockchain-based healthcare data management solutions. The consortium is trying to improve the accuracy of provider directories, a solution which needs $2.1 billion to maintain, according to reports.Considering the massive base of the partnering companies, this project will make a huge impact on the healthcare industry. Athena alone covers more than 40 million people in the US, whereas the other two insurers provide coverage to 55 million people combined.Though blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare sector, the constraints with the access to clinical data are creating major setbacks.
