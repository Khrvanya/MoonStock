A number of additional materials for "non-coders" (i.e., "blockchain enthusiasts, futurists, and students, but also corporate project managers, concepters and c-level managers") will be added to the selection over the next several weeks.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>The Academy also offers the opportunity for its students to earn an IOTA Developer Certification, a certificate of achievement that requires the completion of a "written and oral assessment, carried out by members of the IOTA Foundation."The IOTA Foundation seems to believe that the launch of the Academy will eventually lead to greater adoption of the IOTA network into the Internet of Things. "We believe [that] an investment into IOTA Education, as well as acquiring deep knowledge in short time, will be of great benefit for corporates, engineers and developers to actively shape the upcoming IoT, Machine-to-Machine ecosystems," said Holger Kother, Director of Partner Management at the IOTA Foundation.In launching its Academy, IOTA is joining the ranks of a number of cryptocurrencies that have launched educational initiatives in various capacities over the last several years, including Ripple and Cardano.It's been a rather quiet year for IOTA. The cryptocurrency received quite a bit of attention for collaborations that were formed between itself and a number of high-profile companies, as well as a partnership with the International Transportation Innovation Center (ITIC).Although it may not have made headlines in quite some time, the cryptocurrency's team appear to be continuing to work to expand its internal operations and global presence. IOTA Co-Founder Dominik Scheiner is currently finishing up a round of three meetups spread across the US; last week, blockchain investor Dan Simerman joined the IOTA Foundation.
