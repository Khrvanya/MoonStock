Our partnership with Nova is about enabling that innovation, by helping initial ideas come to fruition in the form of viable, scalable and sustainable business models."Furthermore, Nova will be providing a mentorship programme for successful applicants, and the company will invest in startups that prove user problem-fit. For the companies which find that DLT is the right solution for these problems, then the investment made by Nova will be matched by the IOTA grant programme."There are many hurdles to successfully launching a startup, and many of the most common mistakes occur very early on in the process. The fact that 90% of startups fail means that there are loads of brilliant business ideas out there that simply never materialize into anything meaningful, and a lot of talent and ambition is wasted," added Andrew Dean, Head of Partnerships at Nova."We want to make sure that IOTA entrepreneurs have the best possible chance of success. Some of the most exciting technological developments of our time are fueled by IOTA technology, and we're looking forward to playing a part in bringing some of those ideas to market," he continued.
