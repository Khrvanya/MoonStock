However, soon with the approach of 2018, the project was riddled with controversies as reports surfaced that $4 million worth of IOTA tokens were stolen using malicious online seed generators from the user wallets.A month later, the IOTA Foundation launched a Google developer-like platform called  IOTA Foundation "to house the community of developers, startups, hobbyists and initiatives all over the world working towards the distributed and decentralized future we all aspire to create." The foundation pledged $37 million to finance projects under its umbrella on a condition that the open-source DLT applications should be built on IOTA's core protocol.Although the project began with blockchain development, it has since moved its core interest towards the booming internet-of-things field and partnered with giants like Audi.Last year, IOTA also announced a partnership with the hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger, which enabled its users to store the digital asset in a secure environment."Keeping data secure with infrastructure from Crypto Storage AG will contribute to the development of these concepts and the IOTA Foundation's vision of supporting a machine-to-machine economy," said David Sonstebo, co-founder and co-chair of IOTA Foundation.
