Arguments were also made against not seeking permissions from the website visitors before running the script.However, in the ruling, the Yokohama District Court said that it would be "excessive" to punish the accused as the script cannot be considered a computer virus.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>The preceding judge also mentioned that "[the man's action] does not constitute a crime as we cannot say embedding the program was socially unacceptable."According to the report, the man had introduced Coinhive to his website between October and November 2017.Interestingly, last year, another Japanese court sentenced a 24-year old person to a year in prison for indulging into similar cryptojacking activity, Finance Magnates reported.
