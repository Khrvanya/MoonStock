He also argued that the introduction of an ETF into crypto markets would facilitate an influx of institutional capital, which would eventually make markets less volatile.However, Fujimaki's enthusiasm was met with a harsh dose of realism. An FSA representative at the meeting said that because cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin lack intrinsic value, volatility will remain a big problem. Fujimaki reiterated his point that institutional capital could reduce volatility within the space, but it's unclear whether the regulator agreed with him.The comments by the FSA and Fujimaki come just over a week after the Japanese House of Representatives passed new regulations into law in the upper house of the National Diet, according to local news source Nikkei.The regulations included amendments to two of Japan's financial laws: the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and the Payment Services Act. Both of the amendments included measures to add legislation for cryptocurrency margin trading.
