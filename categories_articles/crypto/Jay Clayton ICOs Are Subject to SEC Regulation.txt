An ICO that takes place outside of the United States doesn't have to adhere to the SEC's rules, even if the regulator does have a long reach.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Less well-known are private placement rules that would allow a firm to launch an ICO without having to register their product as a security.These rules, which Clayton did not elaborate upon when speaking to his interviewers, would most likely be of little to no use for most companies launching an ICO.Firstly, companies that use a private placement to raise capital cannot advertise the fact that they want to do so.Even more significantly, they can only raise funds from up to 35 investors. Given that many companies performing an ICO want to raise small bits of cash from thousands of investors, that cap isn't going to be of much help to them.During his interview, Clayton was also asked about the possibility of a Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF).Remaining fairly shtum on the subject, the SEC Chairman admitted that the regulator was looking at the possibility of a Bitcoin ETF, but that custody services and price information remained problematic.
