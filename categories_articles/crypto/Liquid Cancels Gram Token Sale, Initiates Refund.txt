Though the company was ready for the launch of its blockchain, a lawsuit by the SEC alleging Gram to be unregistered securities forced the company to delay the launch.Telegram also sought permission from all its investors to participate in the two separate token sale rounds for delaying Gram issuance till April.Meanwhile, on the SEC's request, the court ordered Telegram to share the financial records of the token sale with the regulator. The two parties will face the court for the next hearing scheduled for February 18-19.
