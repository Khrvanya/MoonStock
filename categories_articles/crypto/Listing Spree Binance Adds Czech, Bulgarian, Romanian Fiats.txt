With the fresh fiat addition, the exchange now supports 24 fiats in total via its primary and subsidiary trading platforms.Most recently, the exchange also added support for the Australian dollar and Thai baht, Finance Magnates reported. Along with the fiat additions, Binance is also focusing on streamlining user experience with its fiat support and enabled Fast Payments Services (FPS) for British pound deposits on its primary platform.FPS allows the customers to deposit GBP in seconds. Otherwise, it would take three days. Notably, only a handful of exchanges, including Coinbase, Blockchain.com's The Pit, CEX.IO, and Coinfloor, offer this service to their customers.The recent addition is also a part of the exchange's CEO Changpeng Zhao's ambition to add more than 180 fiats by the end of this year.While Binance is ramping up its fiat-based services, crypto options, and futures offering platform Deribit is moving its base from the Netherlands to Panama before the enforcement of 5AMLD rules. It is to be seen whether Binance, which is registered in Malta, also follows the exchange to any Central American or Caribbean countries.
