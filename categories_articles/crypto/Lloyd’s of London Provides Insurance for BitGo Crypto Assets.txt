We are changing that by being more transparent than any other company about the terms of our coverage. Transparency and accuracy is essential for building trust in the market," notes BitGo CEO Mike Belshe.Founded in 2013, BitGo operated originally as a bitcoin wallet provider but then branched out into other cryptocurrencies and now supports multiple altcoins including Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, and Royal Mint Gold. In April 2018, BitGo launched support for ERC20 tokens, and in July it added 57 coins and tokens.BitGo's patent multi-signature wallet technology has attracted institutional players because it offers an enterprise-grade custody service for their assets as well as application programming interface access to its underlying security platform. BitGo's multisig e-wallets require a transaction to have two or more signatures before it can be executed, a security layer that reduces the risk of fraud.For more security, a customer can also set spending limits and corporate treasury policies on the account, which also require multiple approvals from the customer to withdraw above-set limits.Last year, BitGo raised $15 million in new funding, led by Goldman Sachs and Galaxy Digital Ventures LLC, the venture capital firm founded by the billionaire Mike Novogratz.
