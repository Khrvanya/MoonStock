LocalBitcoins is one of the widely used crypto trading platforms for trades based in jurisdictions with restrictions to buy and sell digital currencies. According to its website, the peer-to-peer exchange is offering its services in "248 countries and 7571 cities." Last week, the exchange reported that it has facilitated $58 billion worth of Bitcoin trades across the globe.And without any official announcement, it is still not clear whether the closure of the particular service is temporary or a permanent one.LocalBitcoins has long been trying to get into the good books of regulators by introducing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) rules. In April 2018, the platform made it mandatory for high volume traders to disclose their identity and halted anonymous trading.Earlier this year, the Helsinki-based company announced that it is going to make the trading platform compliant to the AML/KYC standards of the European Union.Meanwhile, with the community resentment against LocalBitcoins, other peer-to-peer trading exchanges offering in-person cash option are boasting their services.LocalEthereum, offering peer-to-peer trading options only for Ether, responded to LocalBitcoins' move by temporarily removing transaction fee for cash-based trades.
