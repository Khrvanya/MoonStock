According to Business Insider, the exchange raised over PS2 million (roughly $2.6 million) from investors prior to its launch. The exchange originally planned to issue prepaid cards that would have allowed users to shop with cryptocurrencies. However, in 2018, the company reportedly re-focused its efforts toward becoming a mobile exchange for UK customers.Signs that something may have been amiss at LBX seem to have appeared as early as January of 2019 when two of the company's three directors (John William Mcleod and Adam Lee Bryant) left the firm.Then, in March of 2019, law firm Squire Patton Boggs filed a winding-up petition against the exchange over a bill worth PS9,900 (around $12,800). After the law firm drafted the exchange's terms and conditions and provided some other services, LBX reportedly did not pay up on time, which caused the firm to raise the amount it was owed.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Benjamin Dives, LBX's then-CEO, said to CoinDesk that "the bill didn't come to my attention until it was very late," and that it was paid "within 24 hours of the [winding up] petition being issued." At the time, Dives said that "we're getting calls from people who think we're going out of business, but we're not going into liquidation," but he was sure that the court would decide in LBX's favor.The same month, podcast host Peter McCormack also claimed in a since-deleted Tweet that LBX was "insolvent": according to McCormack, its staff had not been paid since December of 2018.London Block Exchange CEO has been forced to wind the business down.

However, LBX appears to have denied that anything serious was happening.In response to a user's Reddit post 11 months ago, a representative of LBX wrote that "the exchange is currently undergoing a period of maintenance and as a result, a few features...have been taken offline.""This period of instability has lasted much longer than we had expected and consequently, the service that we're currently providing is falling short of our, and our customer's, expectations," the representative wrote.Finance Magnates reached out to Benjamin Dives, who did not respond immediately for comment.
