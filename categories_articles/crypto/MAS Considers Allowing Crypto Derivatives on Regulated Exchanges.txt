MAS Considers Allowing Crypto Derivatives on Regulated ExchangesThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country's central bank and financial regulatory authority, is working to allow derivatives trading of cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) on approved exchanges in the country, according to a consultation paper that the agency published on Wednesday. The news was reported in the Business Times of Singapore.

The derivatives will be available on approved exchanges, including the Asia-Pacific Exchange (APEX), the Singapore Exchange Derivatives (SGX), and ICE Future.However, MAS reportedly said in a press release that it does not view crypto token derivatives as suitable for trading by retail investors.

The regulator will be accepting public commentary on the regulation until December 20.Finance Magnates reported earlier this month that MAS partnered with JP Morgan Chase and Temasek to build a blockchain-based prototype multi-currency payments network.The collaboration is the latest part of "Project Ubin," a collaborative effort between MAS and industry partners that explores the use of Distributed Ledger Technology.The network will be developed as the project's fifth phase, allowing other blockchains to connect and integrate seamlessly. The platform will also offer features including delivery-versus-payment (DvP) settlement with private exchanges, conditional payments, and escrow for trade, as well as payment commitments for trade finance.
