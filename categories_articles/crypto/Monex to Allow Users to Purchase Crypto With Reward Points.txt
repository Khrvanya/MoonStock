It's also very unlikely to be the last.The brokerage giant, once the dominant player in Japan's retail trading market, has seen stiff competition from rivals Rakuten Securities and SBI over the past couple of years.Things are going to get tougher soon as Nomura and the messaging application Line look set to establish their own trading platform.Expanding into the cryptocurrency markets was one way for Monex to stay ahead of, or perhaps keep up with, its competitors.Thus, we can probably expect to see greater integration between the two firms in the coming months.
