A lot of what they have done just made sense and made me wonder why we hadn't thought of that. The team, their vision, and their products were instantly attractive for those reasons."Monahan's split from her previous venture was not on good terms. Though both co-founders said the split was mutual, Finance Magnates reported earlier that her former business partner filed a lawsuit against her for a dispute over the financial books of MyEtherWallet. She was also accused of hijacking MyEtherWallet's Twitter handle and moving thousands of its followers to the account of MyCrypto."One of the biggest lessons we learned from the 2017 bull-run and subsequent crash was just how under-utilized tokens are," said Jai Bhavnani, CEO of Ambo. "We want to give people an easy way to actually use and gain value from the amazing tokens and protocols being developed beyond simple speculation. We're excited to work with such an amazing team and look forward to helping make MyCrypto the flagship desktop wallet."
