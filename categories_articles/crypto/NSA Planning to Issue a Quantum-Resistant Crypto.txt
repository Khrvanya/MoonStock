While speaking at the summit, Neuberger also pointed out that Ransomware has increased to "4,000 attacks a day over the last number of years" which also has become a major concern for the upcoming 2020 presidential elections in the United States.In addition to Ransomware, the director also emphasized on the state-sponsored cyberattacks by North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran."In the intelligence community, we put a tremendous focus on countries, what their plans are and how they use cyber to achieve their strategic agendas, and each one does things a bit different because their strategic objectives are a bit different," she said in the summit.Last month, a United Nations report revealed that the communist regime of North Korea raised $2 billion by stealing digital currencies and fiats to fund its nuclear weapons program. The country, however, recently released a statement denying all the allegations made against it by the United Nations.Meanwhile, other hacker groups from countries like North Korea are also constantly targeting crypto exchanges for financial gains. Earlier this year, Finance Magnates reported that the infamous North Korean hacker group Lazarus APT adopted sophisticated attacking techniques to breach the security of crypto exchanges.
