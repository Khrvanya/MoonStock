That also detailed that the task force's needs to submit its assessment of the industry by December 15, 2020.However, a few suggested names are also getting some criticisms from a part of the community for not including key members based on the state of New York.Also, the fact that @clydevanel clearly wasn't aware of the close connections among the CSys crowd suggests that independent advisors might be a smarter route than corporate advisors.-- Preston Byrne (@prestonjbyrne) July 23, 2019
