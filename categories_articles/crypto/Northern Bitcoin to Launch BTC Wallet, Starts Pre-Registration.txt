The firm operates mobile Bitcoin mining stations, most of which are installed in Norway, taking advantage of the cool climate of the region to cool down the devices.Earlier this month, Finance Magnates reported that the German firm completed testing of a new air-cooled mining container housing 144 ASIC miners. This is the second such mobile mining station to be introduced by the company as it already deployed 21 40-foot water-cooled containers, each with 210 ASIC miners inside, at the Lefdal Mine Datacenter in Norway.In June, the company procured 4,475 ASIC miners from Cannan Creative and Bitmain to increase its mining arsenal.
