Fleeing the hostile business environment, the exchange along with its peers have since shifted their operations overseas.Commenting on the news, OKCoin CEO Tim Byun said: "In order for the cryptocurrency market to reach its full potential, exchanges like OKCoin have to work with existing and new regulators for convertible virtual currency, digital goods, and/or securities. Our team has worked diligently within the complexities of the US regulatory frameworks. We're excited to take this major step forward as we aim to break down the barriers preventing a truly global digital asset market while adhering to long established regulations."
