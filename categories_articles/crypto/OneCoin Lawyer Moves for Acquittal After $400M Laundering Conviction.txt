Per his testimony, the lack of any genuine blockchain of the project was only known to the founder of the project Ruja Ignatova and two IT professionals.In the filing, the attorneys further raised questions on the jurisdiction of the US prosecutors, as OneCoin did not have many victims in the country. The case was mostly built based on the testimony of Konstantin Ignatov, brother of Ruja Ignatova, and two victims in the country who invested in the digital currency.The defendant also pointed out that neither of the victims met him in person or had any direct dealings with him.Notably, the US prosecutors also took the testimony of Bank of Ireland staff, who revealed that Scott was using multiple accounts at the bank to funnel money from the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands to the United Arab Emirates.Meanwhile, the mastermind of the $4 billion scam, Ruja Ignatova, is still at large and is believed to have fled for Vienna or Athens.
