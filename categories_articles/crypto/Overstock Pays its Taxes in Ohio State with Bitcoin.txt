The company already runs a cryptocurrency unit called tZERO as well as a VC subsidiary named Medici Ventures.Overstock.com's tZero plans to launch a securities clearing and settlement platform based on the blockchain that lets companies raise capital with security tokens. The venture, which will capitalize tZero's regulatory approval to operate as an alternative trading system (ATS), aims to create a way for companies to tokenize equity and issue it on a blockchain without running afoul of regulatory obligations.Commenting on the news, Byrne said: "We have long thought that thoughtful governmental adoption of emerging technologies such as cryptocurrencies (when accompanied by non-restrictive legislation over these technologies) is the best way to ensure the U.S. does not lose our place at the forefront of the ever-advancing global economy.""We applaud Overstock for becoming the first national brand in America to register to pay taxes via cryptocurrency. Their embrace of blockchain technology was ahead of its time and we're proud to have them join OhioCrypto.com," added Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel.
