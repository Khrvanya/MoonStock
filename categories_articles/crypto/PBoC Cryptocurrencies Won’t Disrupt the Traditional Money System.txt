Not too long ago, China dominated the cryptocurrency trading and mining industries, with 95 percent of all BTC trading taking place in the country.However, towards the end of 2017, the Chinese government set in motion a number of bans, causing a lot of confusion for cryptocurrency exchanges, miners and traders alike. First, the government banned ICOs, following this up by banning domestic crypto exchanges. However, while the central bank of China is down on cryptocurrencies, the PBoC does seem to have a soft spot for blockchain technology. The paper stated that China is still overall welcoming of the industry and recommended a more practical approach to DLT. The report also believes that higher government oversight is needed.
