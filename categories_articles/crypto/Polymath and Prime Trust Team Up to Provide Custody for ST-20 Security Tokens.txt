Leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, Japanese financial holdings company Nomura and most recently SIX Group, the owner of SIX Swiss Exchange, have all recently launched similar services for institutional investors.Polymath has its own rules that require investors to verify their status as accredited investors before taking part in a security token offering. Earlier this year, the startup partnered up with Identity Mind for KYC (know-your-customer) and AML (anti-money laundering). Polymath also functions as a network where investors can post their ideas for new security tokens, and development teams can bid to win the contract to build them.Commenting on the news, Igor Denisov, Head of Strategy and Business Development at Polymath, said: "We view digital asset custody as a major gating item for institutional investors aiming to deploy capital in digital securities. Prime Trust is breaking new ground as a qualified custodian for security tokens and helping to pave the way for wider adoption of security token offerings.""We are excited to see Polymath take a leadership position in developing the technology necessary to help ensure securities token offerings comply with ongoing SEC regulations, and are pleased to work with them in providing custody solutions to issuers and customers," added Scott Purcell, Prime Trust CEO and Chief Trust Officer.
