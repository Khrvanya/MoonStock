Prior to Bitcoin Halving Bitmain announces Antminer S19 and S19 ProThe times when Bitmain dominated the Bitcoin mining market are already a little while ago. With the new Antminers S19 and 19 Pro, Bitmain has announced two new mining rigs that put the previous rigs in the shade. The Chinese mining giant Bitmain issued a press release a few hours ago presenting the technical data of the new Antminer S19 and S19 Pro models, which will be available in two versions each.The most powerful rig has a hash rate of up to 110 TH/s, twice the performance of the previous top model, the Antminer S17, which reaches 55 TH/s. The Antminer S19 and S19 Pro of the next generation are available in two versions. The Antminer S19 is equipped with a hash rate of 95 TH/s, while the other variant has a hash rate of 90 TH/s. Both variants have a power efficiency of 34.5+/-%5 J/TH.The Antminer S19 Pro has a hash rate of 110 TH/s, while the other variant has a hash rate of 105 TH/s, both variants have an impressive power efficiency of 29.5+/-%5 J/TH.Announcing the #Antminer S19 Series! The #AntminerS19 has 2 variants, a 95 TH/s and 90 TH/s model, with a power efficiency of 34.5+-%5 J/TH. The #AntminerS19Pro has a 110 TH/s and 105 TH/s model, both with a power efficiency of 29.5+-%5 J/TH.
