Traki has chosen Pundi X' XPOS device to act as an in-store payment processor for cryptocurrency."We made the XPOS with the mission of creating real-life use cases for blockchain technology, and this couldn't be better represented than Traki shoppers paying for their daily needs with cryptocurrency," said Pundi X CEO, Zac Cheah, to CoinDesk. One-tenth of Pundi X' nearly 300,000 users are based in Venezuela.Pundi X aims to sell 100,000 of its XPOS devices by 2021; at press time, the devices were available in 30 countries.Cheah also pointed to Traki as an early adopter of blockchain technology in Venezuela. Additionally, Traki's adoption of the Pundi X device is the latest piece of evidence that Venezuelans have adopted Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a popular alternative to the Bolivar, Venezuela's fiat currency.Indeed, a long spell of hyperinflation and a lack of liquidity in Bolivar markets has caused the currency to have severely devalued.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has attempted to create the Petro, a nationally-backed cryptocurrency, as a way to save the Venezuela economy. However, although Maduro ordered banks and state-owned companies to use the token in July, serious doubts about the project's legitimacy remain.
