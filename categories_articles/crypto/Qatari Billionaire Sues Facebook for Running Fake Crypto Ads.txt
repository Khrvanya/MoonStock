He also represented several celebrities, including Justin Timberlake, Jessica Biel, Jennifer Lopez, Nicolas Cage, and Harrison Ford, in defamation cases in Ireland courts.According to Tweed, the case was strategically filed in Ireland as the European laws give the plaintiff a better chance.

His net worth is estimated to be over a billion euros.Many shady crypto projects have earlier used the images or false endorsements of celebrities to promote their investment schemes to the masses.
