Though AWS was not opposed to hand over the data, it could not do so without a court order as Cotten's account was a private one instead of a business account.Recently, Jenifer Robertson, Cotten's widow, sought $225,000 in compensation for legal costs from creditors. The court, however, deferred any order on the repayment.Last month, the exchange turned its crypto holdings to EY, obeying a previous court order. Though around $190 million if digital assets are still missing, the exchange transferred 51.1 Bitcoin, 33.3 Bitcoin Cash, 2,032.7 Bitcoin Gold, 822.3 Litecoin, and 951.5 Ether to the consulting firm.
