According to ICObench, both of them shared a couple of advisors - Lee Murphy and Mateusz Mach. Mach was featured in Forbes' "30 Under 30" list of entrepreneurs.Both companies even hired the same company for community management, which parted ways from both in May last year citing "irreconcilable differences."Similar to any other major ICO scams, both the companies showered cash to promote their token sales. In 2017, Andrew MacDonald, JoyToken's CEO, even attended the North America Blockchain Expo and later in January 2018 tweeted that he was attending Unblock BC event in Dubai along with JoyToken's "sister company" RepuX.As mentioned by The Next Web, suspicions around both projects were first raised by the members of BitcoinTalk forum around a year ago as both companies failed to repay their ICO promoters.ICO-related exit scams are not new in the decade-old industry. A study by ICO advisory firm Statis Group revealed that over 80 percent of ICOs in 2017 were scams - the largest being Pincoin ($660 million), Arisebank ($600 million) and Savedroid ($50 million). However, only 11 percent of the total invested amount was involved in fraudulent projects.
