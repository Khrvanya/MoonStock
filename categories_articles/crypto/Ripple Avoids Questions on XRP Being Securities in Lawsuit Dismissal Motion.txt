Accordingly, the three-year statute of repose expired as of 2016 (three years after the sales cited in the May 2015 settlement) and in no case later than May 2018 (three years after the May 2015 settlement agreement in which 'Defendants acknowledged that they had sold XRP to the general public,' Complaint P 25).
