The move is significant because the arrangement also involves a partnership to use of XRP, Ripple's digital currency, as part of MoneyGram's cross-border payment process.MoneyGram customers making payments on its international platform already have access to Ripple's enterprise solution, which enables real-time FX settlement through its cryptocurrency, XRP. xRapid will become a feature in Ripple's partnerships with banks and other financial companies further down the line, as it gives these institutions the ability to unlock liquidity and access multiple corridors with one pre-funded originating account.The pilot run will see MoneyGram using XRP to introduce blockchain-enabled cross-border payments. MoneyGram will tap Ripple's on-demand liquidity product, xRapid, to make blockchain payments commercially available, reducing the time and cost of settlement, while maintaining the level of security.
