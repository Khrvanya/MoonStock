The US SEC is also an interested party in the Canadian legal proceedings."The SEC is considering recommending to this Court that the U.S. Assets be sent to the Receiver to effect one, single distribution to harmed investors," the regulator noted. "Prior to making such a recommendation, the SEC is ascertaining whether the Proposed Plan, and the accompanying claims process, is fair and reasonable and whether investors would be better served by one distribution as opposed to a second, separate distribution in the United States."The SEC also pointed out that the total losses to the victims of the ICO exceed $8 million, and if the SEC hands over the distribution process to the third party receiver, it will have less than $5 million to distribute."Reduction of administrative fees is important to maximize the distribution to harmed investors and is a primary reason the SEC is considering a single, coordinated distribution." the filing added.
