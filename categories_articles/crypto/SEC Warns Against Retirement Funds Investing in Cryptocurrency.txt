These include real estate, company stocks, intellectual property and precious metals, and, more recently, cryptocurrencies. The main difference between self-directed and regular IRAs is that the latter are handled by Internal Revenue Service-approved custodians while the former are held by custodians that "disclaim most duties to investors", according to the warning.The warning states that the allure of digital assets and initial coin offerings can be used by fraudsters. It acknowledges that such investments can be "fair and lawful", but says that they "may not provide complete or accurate information to aid investors in making informed decisions."The warning says that holders of self-directed IRAs are more at risk than usual because the custodians of these funds "typically have only limited duties to investigate the assets or the background of the promoter." Scam artists can take advantage of this by telling investors that they can be trusted because the custodian approved them, when in fact this is not necessarily the case.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>It adds that there is also an increased risk of investors being passive in their examination of their investments because they are not allowed to access the money before a certain age.The Japanese Financial Services Agency, that country's financial regulator, released the results of its inspections of local cryptocurrency exchanges.After reviewing 23 entities, the watchdog found a "sloppy reality", according to Nikkei.
