The protocol is aimed at solving Bitcoin's privacy and scalability issues.Unlike most cryptocurrencies, Mimblewimble-based coins do not have a wallet address. The user only holds a set of keys that control the unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). For every transaction, the user creates two new outputs - one to send the desirable amount of crypto and the other to store the balance. The key to the first address is shared with the other party involved in the transaction.The promising prospect of the project also attracted many investors including Peter Thiel, who invested $2.1 million in seed money on the firm.Adrian Thompson, Sapphire's global VP of Marketing, said: "Future products will include new 16GB Graphics additions' to SAPPHIRE's line of INCA and MGI Series of dedicated blockchain systems."According to the announcement, the graphics card is not available in the market yet. However, the company assured that it will be putting the hardware on store shelves soon.
