At the time, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne said that the company was "ready to hit the button and go live today, but was waiting a few more days to process user signups."A prototype of tZERO's trading platform was originally launched in April of 2018, but the platform's history extends farther back than last year. The Overstock subsidiary was originally founded all the way back in 2014.When the prototype was launched, Byrne commented that "in August 2015, Overstock used tZERO's blockchain technology to issue what we believe was the world's first private blockchain security, a $5 million bond to First New York Securities."Then, "in December 2015, Overstock filed with the SEC an S-3 registration statement to register a preferred stock digital security utilizing tZERO's blockchain technology, which was subsequently declared effective in December 2016."Earlier this month, tZERO began distributing its own security tokens, which were purchased by more than 1000 investors during the platform's token sale in August of 2018.Meanwhile, Overstock is seeking to make a complete transition into the blockchain sphere. In November, Byrne announced that the company plans to sell its decades-old online retail businesses over the next few months as it focuses on becoming a blockchain business.
