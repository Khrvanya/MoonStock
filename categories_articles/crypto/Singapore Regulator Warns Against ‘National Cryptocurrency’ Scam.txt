They encourage people to deposit cash with them and hand over sensitive bank information. After that, a person's cash disappears, never to be seen again, except perhaps in a suburb of Kiev."What is to be done?" Lenin, a well-known scammer, asked over a hundred years ago with regard to the state of affairs in Russia. Today we could ask the same question about online financial scams. The criminals will just have to hope we don't start treating them like kulaks.
