"If we are concerned about regulation, we can operate a regulatory agency with the government in a limited area called Jeju Island," said Free Republican Party Member, Won Hee-Ryong. "We will make a case study and try to create a foundation for the government to look at cryptocurrency."Compared with many other countries, South Korea has taken a more restrictive stance on cryptocurrency regulations. This may be due in part to the fact that the mania that struck the cryptocurrency industry in late 2017 hit South Korea harder than any other place in the world.The country banned ICOs in September of 2018, citing concerns that raising funds through the issuance of cryptocurrency was too similar to gambling.The ban was reaffirmed in January after it was discovered that South Koreans were still participating in token sales.Then, early last month, the South Korean Supreme Prosecutor's Office (SPO) formed a task force to fight crime and fraud in the cryptocurrency industry.
