This is largely due to SEBA's prospective licensing-the company expects that it will receive a banking and securities dealer license from FINMA, Switzerland's financial market regulator, by June of 2019. If granted, the license would allow the firm to conduct cryptocurrency trades and investments for qualified investors and other banks.Buhler also said that SEBA plans to offer custodial services. "As a general rule, crypto assets, just like investments in stocks and bonds, must be vested with our custodian bank function to the regulator," he said.In the meantime, Buhler says that SEBA is planning to raise an additional $206 million through an ICO. The funds will go toward the bank's expansion of its operations into major financial hubs in 2019, starting with Zurich.Switzerland has long been one of the world's most noted cryptocurrency industry hubs because of its flexible and crypto-friendly regulations.However, FINMA still recognizes the risks associated with cryptocurrencies. Earlier this month, the regulator sent a confidential letter advising financial institutions within the country to estimate risk coverage of cryptocurrencies for 800 percent of current market value.
