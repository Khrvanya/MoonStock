TRON ecosystem grows through partnership with Youtube alternative DLiveTRON bought BitTorrent early last year for more than $120 million and incorporated it into TRON's ecosystem. Since then, BitTorrent has received regular updates and the number of users has continued to grow. Yesterday the peer-to-peer platform announced that the blockchain-based live streaming platform Dlive will join BitTorrent.DLive will join the BitTorrent ecosystem and begin migration to the TRON blockchain. DLive and BitTorrent will work together to enable block-chain-based peer-to-peer content sharing and live streaming for anyone with Internet access. DLive will promote its own products and services on BitTorrent and use the latest storage services.BitTorrent says:DLive will begin utilizing the BitTorrent File-Sharing System (BTFS), a distributed file sharing and storage system, to allow all content living on DLive to truly move towards decentralization. DLive will also merge its account systems with BitTorrent's to further integrate each community with the other.Through this partnership, 100 million active BitTorrent users per month will be able to access DLive's service offerings and drive the development of DLive. DLive has grown rapidly over the past 15 months and has built a customer base of more than 5 million active users through the niche product it offers.In September 2018 DLive migrated to the Lino Blockchain test network. In December 2018, the first public Happy Hour event was held with discounts at that time. As a result, the platform has grown to 100,000 visitors. In the summer of 2019, PewDiePie held a live streaming event together with Ninja, James Charles and Jack Black, which also further increased the expansion and popularity of the platform.CEO of TRON and BitTorrent, Justin Sun, describes that DLive offers an innovative niche product that will grow rapidly in cooperation with BitTorrent:DLive is a great solution for live media producers. Think of how valuable live streaming content is already to centralized social media platforms who take ownership and advantage of their users' hard work. We look forward to DLive bringing value to the entire world with the addition of TRON and BitTorrent's global community of passionate creators.At this point, DLive will continue to use the Lino blockchain until the migration to the TRON blockchain is complete. To accelerate the integration, several benefits and rewards are offered to existing users to migrate to the new BitTorrent ecosystem. Once the migration is complete, DLive will no longer use the Lino blockchain.The ACE Protocol Foundation, which previously developed and offered the Lino Blockchain, will work with the BitTorrent development team to further develop its vision of creating a long-term, sustainable value sharing content economy as part of a larger, more established community.The Foundation believes that the partnership will enable the Lino community to take advantage of the innovative content sharing and storage solutions of the BitTorrent network, participate in the world's largest peer-to-peer file sharing network and continue to grow as a result. It remains to be seen whether these developments will positively impact the price of TRX or the BitTorrentToken (BTT).The TRON Foundation announced that 33 billion TRX will be released on January 1, 2020, equivalent to about 440 million USD. The funds were blocked when Tron migrated from the Ethereum blockchain to the TRON blockchain. TRON has conducted a survey to determine the purpose for which this capital will be used. 55% of the community decided to burn the TRX.Poll regarding 33b #TRX unlockThis can provide @Tronfoundation information based on how the community feels. @justinsuntronAnswer 1; Invest in partnerships, infrastructure, development, adoption, and awarenessAnswer 2; Lock the tokens back upAnswer 3; Burn a portion-- TRON News | Xin Wen  (@TronNews_) December 28, 2019TRON describes that not all 33 billion TRX are burned at once, but that regular coinburns should be carried out. It remains to be seen whether these actions will have a negative impact on the price of TRX.At the time of writing TRX stands at 0.0138 USD and continues to trend sideways (- 3.83%) within the last 24 hours.Follow us on Facebook and Twitter and don't miss any hot news anymore!
