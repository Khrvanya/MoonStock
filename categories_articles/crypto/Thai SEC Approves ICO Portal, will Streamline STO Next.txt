In the future, the SEC will issue a criteria that allows companies to apply tokenization to securities and other assets," Suppiroj said. "This will help bridge the digital asset royal decree and securities law."According to Suppiroj, the ICO market has matured a lot in the past few years - evolving from project-based token sales to digital currencies backed by intangible assets. The Thai regulator is trying to create a fair market for the new-age funding technique where any players - big or small - will have a similar advantage."The next step is for an issuer to offer security tokens in the primary market," the director added.The Thai market regulator announced the development of a dedicated ICO portal last November, as reported by Finance Magnates, which was supposed to go live in the next month. However, even with the delay, it is considered to be a major step towards putting the digital assets in the mainstream.Last month, the watchdog banned the use of three major cryptocurrencies - Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum Classic - from being used in ICOs, only allowing Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Stellar to be used.
