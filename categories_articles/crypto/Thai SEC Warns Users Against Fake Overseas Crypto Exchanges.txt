Thai SEC Warns Users Against Fake Overseas Crypto ExchangesThailand's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a warning against a new kind of cryptocurrency scam that lures victims into investing with websites that claim to be legal cryptocurrency trading platforms based overseas.Lieutenant Woranan Silam, a spokesman for the Thai Police' Department of Special Investigation, pointed on Saturday to "FX Trading Corporation" as one of these fraudulent platforms. According to The Bangkok Post, the platform "is not authorised to trade in digital currencies as claimed."London Summit 2019 Launches the Latest Era in FX and Fintech - Join NowSeveral other fraudulent platforms "claim to be foreign companies operating outside Thailand offering services via their online portals," the report explained. "It is not known how much they have ripped off from an unsuspecting public."Silam explained that because these companies appear to be operating overseas, Thai authorities will require cooperation from their overseas counterparts in order to investigate the platforms and prosecute their operators, if necessary.The Thai SEC has only authorized four companies to operate digital assets businesses: Bitcoin Co., Bitkub Online Co., and Satang Corporation Co.; Coins TH Co is the country's only authorized cryptocurrency broker-dealer.The Ministry of Finance issued digital asset business licenses to these four crypto-related firms in January of this year "under the recommendation of the SEC Board."Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>In March, Finance Magnates reported that the Thai SEC had approved the launch of an ICO Portal.
