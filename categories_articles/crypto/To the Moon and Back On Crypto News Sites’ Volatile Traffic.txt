To the Moon and Back On Crypto News Sites’ Volatile TrafficThis is the second article in a series on crypto news media. Be sure to check out the first article, too: "Crypto News Media Has Had to 'Get Creative' to Survive."As cryptocurrency markets have fluctuated so heavily over the past several years, so too have the substrates that have formed within the cryptocurrency industry: among them, advertising and news media.London Summit 2019 Launches the Latest Era in FX and Fintech - Join NowNews media and advertising have a particularly important relationship with cryptocurrency markets: indeed, It's a sort of "chicken and the egg" situation: are cryptocurrency prices driven by increased traffic to cryptocurrency news sites, or are higher amounts of traffic on news sites a result of higher cryptocurrency prices?Or, perhaps, are there other factors influencing the way that information is created and spread within the cryptosphere that may be having an effect on market prices? Or-if all of these things can be true at different times-what do traders, reporters, and readers need to be aware of?And what can crypto sites do if their traffic has taken a hit?Whether traffic drives prices or prices drive traffic, looking at the data seems to reveal a direct correlation on some cryptocurrency news sites: higher prices mean more web traffic."As any 'traded' commodity, public interest and PR always have effects on price, and this is not unique to crypto," said Itai Elizur, Chief Operating Officer at Inbound Junction and MarketAcross, to Finance Magnates.However, "the days of a 200% 'moon' due to a non-existent partnership (such as the famous IOTA and Microsoft story) are gone," Elizur said. "But when real things happen, such as earlier this month, when the bitcoin smart contracts platform RSK bought Taringa, the leading LATAM based Facebook competitor, you saw that the news story did have a decent short term effect on the price, but nothing crazy."Daniel Ameduri, financial analyst and co-founder of Future Money Trends, explained to Finance Magnates that this is largely due to the fact that the market is driven by speculation: "Speculators buy and sell on headlines and are easily influenced because they are gambling," adding that this is not unique to crypto: "many other assets are also influenced by the minute by headlines, like stocks, bonds, and even gas prices."On the other hand, though, news can't have such a big effect on price if no one is reading it: "crypto prices are more of a driver of web traffic than the other way around," said John Lewis, CEO & Founder of Pitch Proper, to Finance Magnates. "The bigger the price, the more people want to be involved...take it from Andreas Antonopolous, who attends many crypto and bitcoin events-when prices are high there are many attendees; when prices tank, nobody comes."In any case, there does seem to be a correlation between traffic on certain crypto news sites and coin prices. For example, when compared with Bitcoin prices, data from SimilarWeb shows that web traffic on several major cryptocurrency news sites received more traffic when the price of Bitcoin rose, and less traffic when it fell.For example, traffic on both CoinTelegraph and CoinDesk rose and fell in correlation with the price of Bitcoin over the last six months: when BTC started to come up in April, the number of site visits increased; when the price plateaued between $9000 and $11,000 starting in June, traffic to the sites began to level off. Traffic on CoinTelegraph has taken a dip over the last month as the price of Bitcoin has slid to roughly $8000.However, not every crypto-related content site has had such a straightforward connection.Take, for example, NewsBTC-data from SimilarWeb shows that traffic to the site has steadily decreased in spite of upward price movements in the cryptosphere.Amedeo Moscato, former Global Chief Operating Officer of DX.exchange and Playtech Plc. Executive, who also serves as the current Chief Executive and Founder of Soho Media Ltd., told Finance Magnates that falls in web traffic such as this one could be due to the natural maturation of an industry that is currently recovering from a hype-bubble.
