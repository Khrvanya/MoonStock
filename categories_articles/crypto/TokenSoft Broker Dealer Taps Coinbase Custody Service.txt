This new custody relationship will enable our issuers to simply work with one of the most well-known custody platforms in the industry, providing them with security, compliance and peace of mind."Sam McIngvale, General Manager of Coinbase Custody, added: "As a qualified custodian, Coinbase Custody provides asset issuers a strong foundation for their projects, offering institutional-grade security, financial controls and auditability. Paired with TokenSoft's affiliated broker-dealer, TokenSoft Global Markets, Coinbase seeks to bridge the gap between a client's vision and its ability to raise and securely store the funds during a security token sale."
