We've been getting positive feedback from our clients on our lack of clawbacks as well as Huobi DM's capacity to help sophisticated traders manage the risk of spot market fluctuations," adding that this is why the platform has managed to grow in spite of the bear market.However, it's important to note that the bear market could actually be fueling the growth of the platform, which offers its customers the ability to take both long and short positions on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and EOS. Many investors are eager to bet on the crypto market's decline, buying into short contracts on these assets-the crypto lending industry has soared in the bear market for this very reason.Indeed, a number of crypto trading companies have made moves to launch or expand futures offerings over the past several months. In early December, Hong-Kong based crypto exchange OKEx launched 'Perpetual Swap' contracts; earlier this week, Gate.io launched 'Perpetual Contracts' on its own platform.In spite of the success of the platform, however, Huobi is set to go through with a round of layoffs that was announced before the end of 2018.The exchange did not publicly state how many of its 1000 would lose their jobs, simply stating that it would be "optimising staffing."
