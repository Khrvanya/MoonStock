The bill, if passed, will amend the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934."There'll be a role for the CFTC and FTC to play and we'll be saving the SEC for true securities, knowing predominantly that these are commodities and currency transactions," the Congressman added. "Those are agencies with a lighter touch and we have grown consensus among the industry that they'd be appropriate for the majority of these types of cryptocurrency transactions and the nature of these assets."Currently, the SEC has a tighter grip on the digital assets, and the agency is trying to curb the industry by categorizing most of them as securities. Bitcoin and Ethereum, however, comes under the watch of the CFTC as both of them are very decentralized.Commenting on the difficulty on the exchange's part to determine a response, Soto said he wants the CFTC to at least "establish a rudimentary structure to instill confidence and clarity, so we can continue to dominate in this area for the future of our economy."
