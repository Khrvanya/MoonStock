The partnership will also bring Voyager's crypto-to-fiat functionality to users of Ethos' flagship product, the Ethos Universal Wallet.With this, Voyager ensures a single hub is in place for its users to securely store and trade crypto assets on the blockchain. It also opens up the support of coins that Voyager's existing custody partners do not offer.

The startup's other co-founders include Philip Eytan, an early Uber investor, and Oscar Salazar, the former chief technology officer of the ride-hailing company.
