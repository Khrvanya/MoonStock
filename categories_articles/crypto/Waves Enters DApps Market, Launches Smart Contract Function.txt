Last October, its network recorded 6.1 million transactions in a single day.Being a for-profit company, it was not developed by a decentralized community. However, the network allows more people to participate in the network maintenance rather than confining it to a few centralized nodes."For blockchain developers, this means a cheaper and more convenient coding process than ever before, while those from outside the blockchain segment will see the entry threshold substantially lowered and new opportunities arrive," Ivanov added.According to Waves' estimation, the DApps industry is currently valued at $3.2 billion, and the top 4 platforms are serving to around 800,000 users. The company decision to jump into the sector is also boosted by the bullish prediction of DApps market.Waves is also attracting the attention of the blockchain investors as in last December it secured $120 million from both venture capitals and individual investors. Earlier this year, the blockchain company also launched its own decentralized crypto exchange.
