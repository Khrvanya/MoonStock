Wells Fargo Invests in Crypto Intelligence Firm EllipticWells Fargo, the fourth-largest bank in the world, has set its eyes on the blockchain technology sector, investing in London-based cryptocurrency compliance firm Elliptic. This was reportedly done by Wells Fargo's venture unit to accelerate the development of Elliptic's product that helps banks to assess hundreds of crypto exchanges operating worldwide.Called 'Elliptic Discovery,' this solution is purpose-built for banks to enable them to identify crypto exchanges that are complying with strict regulatory standards. Discovery boasts a database of hundreds of exchanges, collected since 2013, including their owners, jurisdiction, regulatory status, and compliance policies.City Banquet 2030 - The perfect vessel to grow your business this yearThe investment made by Wells Fargo Strategic Capital complements Elliptic's Series B funding round led by Tokyo-based SBI Group in September 2019. At the time, the blockchain intelligence company raised $23 million, including new investment from AlbionVC, and participation from existing investors SignalFire, Octopus Ventures, and Santander Innoventures.The new investment, which brings the company's total funding to over $40 million, will fuel Elliptic's continuing expansion into Asia, with new offices opening in Japan and Singapore. The funding will also be used to accelerate product development to support an emerging class of asset-backed crypto-assets such as Facebook's Libra, Line Corporation's LINK, and central bank digital currencies.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Wells Fargo has already a cryptocurrency project in the works.
