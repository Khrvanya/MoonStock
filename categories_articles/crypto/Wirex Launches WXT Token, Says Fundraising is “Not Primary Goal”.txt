Wirex Launches WXT Token, Says Fundraising is “Not Primary Goal”Crypto and fiat digital payment platform Wirex has announced the creation of the Wirex Token (WXT), its "first native cryptocurrency," today, June 10th. According to an official statement from the company, the coin "is designed to help users access unique rewards, [and] save on fees."The announcement of the token also explained that its launch would help the company to achieve its ultimate goal of "[democratizing] access to fast, low-cost international remittance and empower retail and corporate customers to use their cryptocurrency in day-to-day life." Wirex is perhaps best known for its debit card that allows its users to operate with both fiat and digital money.Discover the Barcelona Trading Conference - A Top Tier Crypto Trading EventPavel Matveev, Wirex' CEO and co-founder, explained in the announcement that: "we believe that the nascent token economy will eventually replace conventional fiat currency as the dominant form of payment.""The Wirex Token helps us integrate with the payment environment of the future and offer users a convenient, fast, and cost-efficient way to move digital money across borders."Pavel Matveev, CEO,and Co-Founder at Wirex, will be a keynote speaker at Finance Magnates' upcoming Barcelona Trading Conference on July 10th and 11th.The token will be sold and distributed through an Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) via OKEx' Jumpstart program.The public sale will take place on the 26th of June when just 1 percent of the token WXT token supply will be available to buyers on a first-come, first-serve basis for $0.01 per token.
