R3 filed claims against Ripple last year in three different US courts, claiming that the company owed it 5 billion XRP tokens as part of a former partnership. Ripple countered with the fact that R3 had failed in its own obligations. The case was finally settled in September 2018, the terms not disclosed to the public.R3 is a New York-based consortium which counts more than 200 major financial institutions among its members. It has raised millions of dollars in investment money since its inception in 2015.Recently, Ripple was all over the internet because of rumours that a technical upgrade of a SWIFT system would allow hundreds of extra banks to use XRP. The update has been applied, and this rumour appears to have been groundless.
