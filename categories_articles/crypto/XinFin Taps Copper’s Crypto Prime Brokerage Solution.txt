The infrastructure reduces the counterparty risks allowing investment managers to trade through a dedicated and whitelisted custodian.To move digital assets out of a Copper wallet, the system requires multiple private key holders to approve transactions, which removes the inherent risk associated with keys creation and management. The risks have been demonstrated in the recent past as many crypto wallets and exchanges have been hacked, and customer data has been compromised.Suggested articlesSpectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>Spectre.ai Launches World's First Hyper-API and Mobile App!Go to article >>XinFin validates transactions through its own Ethereum-compatible XDC cryptocurrency token and its XDC01 protocol.

With Copper's custodial services now available for XDCe, regulated institutions like banks, crypto hedge funds, and financial entities will have a secure solution to store their digitised XDCe holdings. Copper is also planning to provide support for XinFin's primary chain coin XDC in the near future."Dmitry Tokarev, CEO of copper.co, added: "Institutions need a lot more than an app with pretty charts. They need proper security, which includes technology, insurance, people, and business processes - as well as exceptional client service. We're proud to have earned XinFin's trust and their business."Copper's Walled Garden solution appeals particularly to investors who require exposure to the digital asset without necessarily wanting to be fully exposed to the risks associated, such as hacking attacks or management of access keys.

Fidelity Digital Assets, the cryptocurrency arm of Boston-based Fidelity Investments, is offering custody services for the new fund.
