According to eToro, 61 percent of both genders were interested or very interested in more cryptocurrency education.Of course, the sophists' conclusion of all of this would be more education is going to lead to more investors. But someone saying that a lack of knowledge is preventing them from investing doesn't mean that having that knowledge would lead to them investing. After all, it wouldn't be illogical to study cryptocurrencies, think they're garbage and never invest in them.For retail brokers, a paucity of knowledge could be both a blessing and a curse. Unscrupulous firms are, as they so often have before, almost certain to take advantage of people's ignorance and convert it into investments that line their pockets.Those that are more forward-looking should be concerned by current educational materials. Forums and social media sites, especially YouTube, are populated by less than savory characters who are much more interested in receiving introductory commissions than providing real educational content.Such people not only cultivate stupidity amongst retail traders, which in turn spurs a short-term, burn and churn business model for brokers, but they also perpetuate the image of the cryptocurrency market as being a haven for scammers, hucksters, and con-men.Thus, some more official educational materials and certificates would be a boon - not just for traders that want to learn more but for cryptocurrency companies that want to bolster the image of the industry.
