  As oil supply falls in non-OPEC countries, it could signal higher  demand that could send crude oil prices to as high as $80 a  barrel, says David Pursell, managing director at Tudor Pickering  Holt.   "I think you have to believe that the market is not as  oversupplied as consensus believes," he told CNBC's "Power Lunch"  on Monday.  Pursell said that inventories are already more balanced compared  with the second quarter of this year. In addition, demand growth  will continue as non-OPEC supply falls next year. "So that puts  the market clearly undersupplied by the back half of 2016; that's  not tomorrow but those factors coupled into the equation boil out  to be $80."  However, he said, companies will not be able to assume that price  target will happen as they plan for the coming quarters because  their balance sheets won't allow it.   "The challenge is that companies are going into planning sessions  now and although they want oil to be $80 in the back half of next  year, they certainly are not planning on it."
