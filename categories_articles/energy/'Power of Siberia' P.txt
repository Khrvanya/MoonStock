Natural GasChina has started to consume Russian gas via the newly launched "Power of Siberia" pipeline, said CNPC-backed Kunlun Energy Ltd, operator of the pipeline in China, on Wednesday. The company receives 250,000-300,000 cubic meters of pipeline gas daily from Russia, helping to ease tight gas supply in winter season in Harbin, provincial capital of the north-most region Heilongjiang.
 
The 3,000-km (1,864 mile) pipeline, launched in December, is expected to transmit 4.6 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas from Russia's Siberian gasfield to China, rising to 10 bcm in 2021 and by 25 bcm in 2024.
