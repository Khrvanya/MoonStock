  Crude is poised to go lower, said oil expert John Kilduff, whose  bearish calls on the commodity have been dead on.  "I don't see this market coming into balance until at least Q1 of  2017, if not later," Kilduff told CNBC's "Worldwide Exchange" on Friday, a day after the International Energy Agency said global oil markets are heading toward a long-awaited equilibrium.  OPEC on Friday warned  oversupply still persists. The cartel meets again on June  2.  Since the Feb. 11 bottom, West Texas Intermediate crude, the American  benchmark, has surged about 70 percent. But WTI is still off  more than 50 percent since June 2014 highs of around $114 per  barrel.  While the market seems to be in a bullish mode right now, there  are three bearish factors being ignored, according to  Kilduff, founding partner of Again Capital. First, he believes the dollar will continue to weigh  on oil prices. "I think the currency headwind is going to emerge,  there's no way the dollar can stay this low versus some of these  major currencies going forward."  Oil is traded in dollars, so when the greenback moves higher it  puts the squeeze on foreign buyers.Second, Kilduff said trends in Asia support his theory that crude is  headed lower.  "The big Achilles' heel here is Asia," he said. "The Asian demand  center, which is key to the equation, [is] not looking good  — China, Japan, South Korea, all of them [are] struggling  mightily."Third, the more obvious factor that will send prices lower is supply,  said Kilduff. "We are still oversupplying the daily needs of the  globe here by 1.5 million barrels [per day]."  As for the acute outages in several major oil-producing  countries, Kilduff sees them as "easily fixable," referring  to mechanical problems with a pipeline in Nigeria and closures related to wildfires in Canada's oil sands region.
