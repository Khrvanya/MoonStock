WindSpanish renewable energy developer Acciona has started construction of the 157.5MW Mortlake South Wind Farm in Victoria, Australia.Acciona Energia is building the wind farm with an investment of about A$288m (EUR180m) and it will be powered by 35 of Nordex's 4.5MW turbines. The wind farm will be 100% owned by the Spanish company.
 
Each of the wind turbines will have a rotor diameter of 149m and the blades will almost be about 73m in length. When the wind farm comes into operation in the second half of next year, it will increase Acciona's wind power capacity by 36% to 592MW in the country.
 
The Mortlake South wind farm will generate enough clean electricity to power nearly 115,000 Australian homes, while avoiding 532,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere annually. The construction phase will result in the generation of nearly 100 jobs and 10 permanent jobs during the operational phase.
