WindMarine contractor Van Oord has kicked off foundation installation at the 370MW Norther offshore wind farm off Belgium.Jack-up Aeolus has reported for duty to install the project's 45 monopiles and transition pieces, which were supplied by a Sif and Smulders partnership.
 
The work is being carried out three months later than initially planned after upgrades to the vessel took longer than expected.
 
However, the project developers Elicio, Eneco and Mitsubishi Corp subsidiary DGE said commissioning is still scheduled for next summer.
 
"Installing the 45 foundations is extremely important and meticulous work," said project director Dennis Sanou.
 
"They constitute the base for the whole structure. Thanks to Van Oord's expertise and the project experience of the Aeolus's crew, we'll make a successful start with this project."
 
Van Oord is balance of plant contractor for the project.
 
The wind farm, which will feature MHI Vestas 8.4MW turbines, is due online next year.
