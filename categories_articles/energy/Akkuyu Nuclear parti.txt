NuclearAkkuyu Nuclear Company has got the Limited Construction Permit (LCP) for the first nuclear power plant (NPP) in Turkey from the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority (TAEK).  
The Russia-based company said that the permit represents the first stage in obtaining the construction license, which would be building up the NPP project.  LCP had been offered after a thorough review and assessment of its documents by TAEK. The nuclear project is situated in Mersin province in southern Turkey. It is expected to commence in October 2023 to coincide with Turkey's centenary holiday.

Russia is funding the NPP under a build-own-operate exemplary, in correlation with an intergovernmental accord established with Turkey in 2010. After obtaining the LCP, Akkuyu Nuclear can proceed to construction and installation activities at all facilities related with the proposed nuclear power plant. Still, the permit will not cover facilities like construction of buildings and structures, which are very important things for the nuclear safety.

The project is now in the position to advance from the preparation steps to the constructional activity stage. A compelling part of the construction works are being expected to be performed by local subcontractors.

Galanchuk said: "Our next task is to get the Construction License. We would like to commence construction of the entire set of the NPP buildings and structures at the earliest time possible. "Full compliance with all national and international safety standards remains our top priority."

Officers of the TAEK's Nuclear Safety Department are enrolled to evaluate and inspect the work progress at the nuclear plant site in the upcoming months before publishing a report related to the project's construction license application.

The construction license is likely to be granted in the first half of 2018 year and it will enable Akkuyu Nuclear to advance on the construction of all infrastructure dan system installations of the Turkish nuclear plant without any barriers.
