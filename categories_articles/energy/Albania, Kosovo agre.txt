The agreement was signed with the knowledge of ENTSO-E and is a prerequisite for the independent operation of the Kosovo.
 
The governments of Albania and Kosovo see the common energy market as a very important step towards increasing electricity transmission between the two countries. They also expect the common market to improve power supplies to consumers in Albania and Kosovo and add value to the energy infrastructure in the region of Southeast Europe.
 
The first step toward establishing a common market was finalized in June 2016 with the inauguration of 400 kV interconnection power line worth 75.5 million euro ($83.4 million) between Albania and Kosovo financed by the German government.
