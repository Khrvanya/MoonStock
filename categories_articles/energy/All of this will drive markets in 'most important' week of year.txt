  Markets could be in for macro overload in the week ahead with  central bankers, next Friday's jobs report and OPEC dominating the  headlines."My guess is most of the action will be a tail wind for stocks,"  said Jack Ablin, CIO of BMO Private Bank. Central bankers in the U.S. and Europe are in high gear in the coming  week, with the European Central Bank expected to expand its easing  program and cut its already negative deposit rate. That coincides  with a week that could bring the most important U.S. jobs  report and other data the Fed will consider when it meets Dec. 15  and 16.
