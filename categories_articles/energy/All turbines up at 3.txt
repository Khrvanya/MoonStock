April 29 (Renewables Now) - Dutch marine contractor Van Oord has completed turbine installation at the 370-MW Norther offshore wind farm in Belgium, it announced on Friday.The first V164-8.4 MW turbine by MHI Vestas was erected in February, while installation of all 44 machines was completed ahead of schedule in less than nine months. As previously announced, the complex is planned to be fully operational this summer.
 
Norther is a project of Elicio NV, with a stake of 50%, Japan's Mitsubishi Corp (TYO:8058), which holds 25% through Diamond Generating Europe, and Eneco Holding NV, also with 25%. Van Oord was the main contractor.
 
Located off the Zeebrugge coast, the huge wind farm will sell electricity to Eneco Holding NV and France's Engie (EPA:ENGI), with each of them buying a 50% share of the production, which is seen to be enough to meet the demand of around 400,000 Belgian homes.
