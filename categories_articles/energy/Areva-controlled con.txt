NuclearFrance's Areva and Germany's Siemens will make a payment of 450 million euros (PS400 million) for cost overruns and postponements at a nuclear reactor which they are constructing for Teollisuuden Voima (TVO) in Finland, settling a long-running dispute.Initially planned to start production in 2009, the Olkiluoto 3 plant is still not finalised, and suppliers and TVO have requested billions of euros from each other at an arbitration court.

Following the agreement, the firms declared they would remove all ongoing legal actions.

Areva mentioned it will obtain all resources needed to complete the plant which is likely to function in May 2019.

A turnkey accord for Olkiluoto 3, inked in 2003, established the cost of the reactor at 3.2 billion euros. TVO declared that its total investment will be approximately 5.5 billion euros.

Areva-Siemens had been demanding 3.6 billion euros from TVO, while a counter-claim of 2.6 billion euros had been filed by the Finnish company.

Olkiluoto 3, a European Pressurised Reactor (EPR), is likely to become Finland's fifth and biggest nuclear unit and offer around 10 percent of the nation's electricity needs.
