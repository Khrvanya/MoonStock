  Art Cashin told CNBC on Wednesday he wasn't entirely convinced by  the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries'  agreement to reduce  oil production.  "I believe that's what they are going to announce,"  the  director of UBS's floor operations at the NYSE said on "Squawk  Alley." "Whether it sticks or not is a completely different  thing."   On Wednesday, OPEC agreed to cut production by about 1.2 million  barrels per day after oil prices have continued to fall due to  global oversupply and booming U.S. shale production.  "Half of that will come from OPEC, half of that will come from  non-OPEC sources," Cashin said about OPEC's agreed cuts. "We'll  have to see what the Russians actually do about it. We have a  history over the last two years of these phenomenal short  squeezes in the pits and they tend to over-tread very heavily."  He continued: "I think you want to see if they really deliver.  Mr. [Igor] Sechin in Russia has right up until this week said he  didn't think he was going to be cutting back. And now —  while he's not the oil minister — he runs on one of the  largest oil companies that they have there, and he is reputed to  be the best friend forever of Mr. [Vladimir] Putin. So, we'll  see." Cashin said that he has doubts because the organization has come out before and said it had everything figured out. But Cashin said, "When nobody can see what's going on, the cheating begins almost immediately." —CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this  report.
