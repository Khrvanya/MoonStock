  Asia markets closed mixed on Monday, with major indexes in  Australia, Japan and South Korea extending gains after the Bank  of Japan's (BOJ) surprise move on Friday to adopt negative rates sent stocks  higher from Tokyo to New York.   In Japan, the  closed up 346.93 points, or 1.98 percent, at  17,865.23 while the Topix gained 30.60 points, or 2.14 percent, to 1,462.67.  Across the Korean Strait, the Kospi finished 12.76 points, or 0.67 percent,   higher at 1,924.82.   Down Under, the ASX 200 retraced some gains to close up 38.07  points, or 0.76 percent, at 5,043.60; earlier, the index was up  as much as 1.17 percent. The energy sector, which rose as much as  2 percent in early trade, pared gains to close up 0.49 percent,  while the financials sector finished up 0.39 percent.   Evan Lucas, market strategist at spreadbetter IG, wrote in a  morning note that the BOJ's move was "a net positive for risk,  net positive for international trade and increases in fund flows  in Asia. All are seen as a macro positive."  Markets in Greater China were in negative territory with Hong  Kong's  closing down 87.61 points, or 0.45 percent, at 19,595.50. On the  mainland,  lost 48.34 points, or 1.77  percent, to close down at 2,689.25. The index is down some 24  percent since the start of the year. The Shenzhen composite also shed  17.52 points, or 1.03 percent, to close down at 1,671.90.   Some of the biggest losers on the Shanghai index were  China Shipbuilding, down 5.17 percent,  Baotou Steel, down 4.73 percent, and China Railway Group,  lower by 3.77 percent.   Earlier, an official survey showed China's  factory sector contracted for the sixth straight month. The  official manufacturing purchasing manager's index (PMI) came in  at 49.4 in January, marginally missing a Reuters estimate for  49.6. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in activities.  Meanwhile, the Caixin manufacturing PMI data was at 48.4 in  January, marginally up from the previous reading of 48.2 a month  earlier and slightly beating market expectations. The  closely-watched gauge of nationwide manufacturing activity  focuses on smaller and medium-sized companies, filling a niche  that isn't covered by the official data.  HSBC's Greater China economists, Jing Li and Julia Wang, wrote in  a note that both domestic demand and input prices saw smaller  contractions, which suggest a degree of stabilization in the  world's second-largest economy. But they warned, "risks to  growth likely remained on the downside with overseas demand  falling and employment still weakening."  "Today's data suggest that deflationary pressures still persist  in the manufacturing sector and will continue to weigh on overall  economic growth," the wrote.   Oil prices were down in Asian trading hours, with U.S. crude futures lower by 1.99 percent to $32.95 a barrel, while globally traded Brent was down 2 percent at  $35.27. Last week, U.S. crude  gained 10.81 percent for the week and Brent rose 13.9 percent after there was speculation over a possible deal  between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to  cut production in the face global oversupply.  Energy plays traded mixed on Monday, with shares of Santos closing down 3.48 percent. Woodside Petroleum gave up gains of over 1 percent to finish lower by 0.14 percent, and Oil Search was finished up 0.77 percent. Japan's Inpex gave up gains to close flat and Japan Petroleum gained 1.62 percent. South Korea's S-Oil was up 4.09 percent. Chinese energy plays were mostly down. Hong Kong-listed shares of CNOOC down 3.17 percent and mainland shares of Petrochina closed down 2.82 percent.   Banking and financial stocks across the region were mixed.   In Japan, banking stocks were mostly down, with major players  extending losses from Friday after the BOJ's announcement.  A negative interest rate will likely see their profits  dented. Mitsubishi UFJ was down 5.46 percent, SMFG fell 7.61 percent, and Mizuho Financial was down 5.88 percent. Down Under, major banks closed mixed, with ANZ being the biggest gainer, with its shares up 1.70 percent.   Resources producers also finished the session mixed with Rio  Tinto down 0.41 percent while shares of BHP Billiton and Fortescue were 0.65 and 3.18 percent lower.   Also ahead, investors in Australian markets will watch the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA)  meeting on Tuesday, where experts expect the central bank to  leave interest rates on hold at 2 percent.  Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at  AMP Capital, said a note on Friday, "December quarter inflation  was low but in line with RBA expectations, recent Australian  economic data has been okay and it's doubtful that the latest  bout of financial and commodity market turmoil has been enough to  move the RBA out of its "chilled out" state."  He added, "However, the latest round of worries about global  growth coming at a time when domestic growth remains sluggish,  national income is being hit by the continuing slump in commodity  prices, the housing sector is losing momentum and inflation is  low are likely to see the RBA strengthen its easing bias."  He added he expects the RBA to cut the cash rate again in the  months ahead.   Shares of electronics maker Sony closed up 12.41 percent after the company  reported its fiscal third-quarter earnings. Reports said net  profit rose 33.5 percent on-year to 120.1 billion yen ($999.8  million), beating market expectations.   Japanese exporters such as Toyota, Nissan and Canon finished higher, between 1.44 and 2.71 percent, as the dollar-yen pair traded higher at 121.25.  A weaker yen is a positive for exporters as it increases  their overseas profits when converted into local currency.   Reuters reported this morning that Toyota would halt all  production at its Japan assembly plants from February 8 to 13 due  to a steel shortage, following an explosion at a steel plant  operated by one of its affiliates. Production is reportedly said  to resume on February 15.  Sharp shares  retraced early losses of as much as near 2.9 percent to trade up 2.88 percent. The Japanese electronics maker currently has two  competing investment offers; one from Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision  Industry, better known as Foxconn, and one from a  Japanese state-backed fund.   Shares of troubled air bag manufacturer Takata were down 9.98 percent, after reports said last week its CEO had no plans to  stand down as of now.
