"The oil market is unlikely to be impressed by any token, face  saving agreement from OPEC largely based on production freezes,"  said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, in a note.  Reuters, citing a source, reported documents prepared for the  meeting proposed OPEC cut production by 1.2 million barrels per  day from October levels at 33.82 million barrels a day, which was  more than the 1 million barrel per day the group discussed at a  meeting in September.   Meanwhile, the oil minister of the United Arab Emirates,  Suhail al Mazroui told CNBC on Tuesday the obstacle  standing in OPEC's way to cut a deal was that not all  member states appeared ready to participate in production  cuts.   Others believed even if OPEC were to reach a deal on Wednesday,  ensuring compliance from every member to reduce output could be  an issue.   "The weight of any cuts will almost certainly fall on the  shoulders of both Saudi (Arabia) and the other Gulf Cooperation  Council countries," said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at  OANDA.   Spooner added the "substantial increase in OPEC production over  recent months will leave the market in a surplus position for  some time unless it can agree on significant and sustainable  production cuts."
