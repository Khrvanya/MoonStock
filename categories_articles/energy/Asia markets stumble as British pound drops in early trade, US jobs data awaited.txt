  Asia markets stumbled on Friday, with sentiment weighed by the  British pound's sharp drop in early trade, while traders likely  took to the sidelines ahead of the key U.S. September jobs report  due later the global day.   In Australia, the ASX 200 closed down 15.64 points, or 0.29 percent, at 5,467.39. Most sectors finished lower, but the heavily-weighted financial sub-index edged up 0.11 percent and the energy sector advanced 0.72 percent.   Japan's  finished down 39.01 points, or 0.23 percent, at 16,860.09. Across the Korean  Strait, the Kospi closed lower by 11.50 points, or 0.56 percent, to 2,053.80. In Hong Kong, the   fell 100.68 points, or 0.42 percent, to close at 23,851.82. Markets  in China remained  closed for the Golden Week public holidays.   In the currency market, the British pound dropped sharply,  touching fresh three-decade lows. In what was being described as  a "flash crash," Cable dropped as low as $1.1819  briefly, before climbing back up to around $1.2437 as of 3:26 p.m. HK/SIN. Earlier in the session, it traded as high as  $1.2624, although that was off from levels above $1.30 last  week.   In February of 1985, the pound fell as low as $1.0520 amid an  acrimonious mining-industry strike.   "Investors may have thought that negotiations are going  to be easy, but today's flash crash has shown where the  support [level for the pound] is and the reality is this that it  won't be long before we may touch the low again," said Naeem  Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets, in a note.   Analysts at Singapore's DBS Bank said in a morning note on Friday  that markets were bracing for more volatility from Brexit  uncertainties, following signals from Germany and France on tough  negotiations with the U.K. as well as Prime Minister Theresa  May's criticisms of the ultra-loose monetary policy set by the  Bank of England.  "Any lawyer can tell you that divorces tend to be messy,  complicated, emotional and loud," the DBS analysts said.   Though the pound recovered from the early lows, some  strategists believed the currency faced a bumpy ride ahead.  Foreign exchange strategists at Australia's Macquarie Bank wrote  in a note to clients that while Cable may recover to the $1.25  mark later in the global day, "all technical support has now been  obliterated, so sterling is doomed from here over the months  ahead."   "Bargain-hunting by foreigners will help slow the path lower, but  we should not over-estimate the impact of U.K. property purchases  and inbound M&A activity," the strategists said.    The bid yield on the 10-year Gilt climbed as high as 0.967  percent in Asian afternoon hours, up from its previous  closing level at 0.873 percent. The bid yield on the 30-year Gilt  reached as high as 1.687 percent, up from its last close at 1.594  percent. Bond prices move inversely to yields.  Elsewhere, the dollar index, which measures the greenback  against a basket of currencies, climbed to 97.080, from levels  below 95.600 earlier in the week. The dollar's strength sent  other major currency pairs lower.   The Japanese yen was weaker against the dollar,  which was fetching 103.88 yen, compared with levels below 101.00  yen in the previous week. The Australian  dollar traded at $0.7566, falling from levels near  $0.7660 reached earlier in the week.   The off-shore yuan, which is more freely traded, weakened against  the dollar, trading at 6.7141, compared with levels near 6.68 in  the previous week. The onshore market was closed for the Golden  Week public holidays.   Beginning this month, the Chinese currency was included in the  International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Special Drawing Right (SDR)  basket and was given a weight of 10.92 percent in the basket,  compared with the dollar's 41.73 percent weight and the yen's 8.33  percent.   In other developments, oil prices advanced to four-month highs on  Thursday, following reports of another informal meeting between  oil producers.   Reuters reported, citing OPEC sources,  that energy ministers from Saudi  Arabia, Iran and Iraq will be  among key OPEC representatives to meet non-OPEC  member Russia at the  sidelines of an energy conference in Istanbul in the coming  week.   During Asian hours on Friday, U.S.  crude futures advanced 0.52 percent to $50.70 a barrel,  after finishing up 1.2 percent in the U.S. session. Global  benchmark Brent rose  0.59 percent to $52.83 a barrel, after adding 1.3 percent  overnight.   In company news, shares of Samsung  Electronics closed up 0.89 percent at 1,706,000 Korean  won a share, touching a record high.   Before market open, the consumer electronics giant issued earnings  guidance, where it said it expected third-quarter operating  profit to be approximately 7.8 trillion won ($7 billion). A  pickup in its components business likely offset the impact of the  Galaxy Note 7 smartphone recall.   That beat a Thomson Reuters StarMine SmartEstimate of analysts'  forecasts that predicted Samsung's profit was around 7.4 trillion  won in the July-September period, said Reuters.   In Hong Kong, China's eight largest brokerage firm by  assets, China Merchants  Securities, made a lackluster  trading debut. It traded at 12.02 Hong Kong dollars as of  3:37 p.m. HK/SIN, compared with an initial public offering (IPO)  price of HK$12.00.  Major Australian banks finished mostly up, with Commonwealth Bank of  Australia shares up 0.3 percent, Westpac advancing 0.59 percent and  the National Australia  Bank gaining 0.11 percent. ANZ shares  were nearly flat.   Chief executive officers at all four banks made appearances at a  Parliamentary inquiry this week, bearing apologies for  overcharging customers and giving bad financial advice.   — Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.
