Long-term U.S. government debt yields fell on Tuesday, while short-term Treasury yields rose. That "flattening" trend is usually present before an economic downturn as risk inflates short-term debt yields.One economist said a flattening trend did not necessarily mean that recession was imminent."We wrote about this some time ago, noting that [the flattening yield curve] was unlikely to be a reliable guide to looming recession risk, despite a slow drift of market names to embrace this view," Rob Carnell, head of research for Asia at ING, wrote in a note.Carnell explained that at the long end of the yield curve, things are "remarkably stable." He pointed out that changes were at the front end of the yield curve."And what appears to have driven this front-end rise is the final realization by markets that the Fed is not a "one and done" organization, but really will be following up the December hike with another, and then probably another next year," he said. Carnell also pointed out that the market was previously "reluctantly pricing in tightening only one meeting at a time, being prepared to price the next hike slowly, only once the last one was safely in the bag."On Wednesday afternoon Asia time, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 2.3506, while the yield on the 30-year bond was at 2.7531 at 3:48 p.m. HK/SIN.

Merkel subsequently said she would prefer going to the polls over leading a minority government.Meanwhile, currency experts at Swiss bank UBS predicted that the dollar is set to have a disappointing run against the euro in 2018 despite the  continuing its current cycle of rate hikes into next year. While a rise in benchmark rates is usually beneficial for the greenback as more people flock to U.S. assets in anticipation of higher yields, UBS said it believes the euro will out-muscle anything the dollar does next year.
