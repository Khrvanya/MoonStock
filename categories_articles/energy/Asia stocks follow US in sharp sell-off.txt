John Woods, chief investment officer for Asia-Pacific for private banking  and wealth management at Credit Suisse, told CNBC's Squawk Box  that markets are heavily oversold currently and will likely  exercise a powerful technical rally.But he urged caution over growth at the moment. "We are still quite cautious on the Fed, oil and China. Until we  get some level of stability, certainty and clarity in those  areas, we are actually recommending clients to lighten up," he  said."Until we get some clarity in those three drivers at a global  level, we are neutral on  equities and where we see, for  example, in China, the likelihood of some further volatility, if we  see a technical rally, if we see a bull rally coming from these  very low levels, we suggest clients explore the possibility of  lightening their exposure going into it," Woods added.  Two consecutive sessions of declines in overnight oil prices have  erased most of last week's four-day gain, and was partly  responsible for the drop in equities.
