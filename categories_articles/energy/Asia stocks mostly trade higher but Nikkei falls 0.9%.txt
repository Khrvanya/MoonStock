  Most Asian markets closed up on Thursday, following a mostly  higher finish on Wall Street overnight amid an oil price  surge.   "The global equity market has become a hostage of oil movement.  The correlation is immensely in tandem," Naeem Aslam, an analyst  at AVA Trade, said in a note Thursday. "The strong rally over in  the U.S. has also helped Asian markets to secure some  gains."  Australia's ASX  200 gained 103.64 points, or 2.13 percent, to 4,980.40, with  the energy sector retracing losses from Wednesday's session to  tack on 6.21 percent, while the material sector was up 6.23  percent on the back of higher commodity prices.   In South Korea, the Kospi gained 25.59 points, or 1.35 percent, to  1,916.26, while in Hong Kong, the  index gained 1.43   percent.   Chinese markets gained ground, with the  closing up 42.54 points, or 1.55 percent, at 2,781.79 while the smaller Shenzhen composite gained 33.86 points, or 1.95 percent, to 1,771.06.   Bucking the positive trend, the  extended recent losses to  close 146.26 points, or 0.85 percent, lower at  17,044.99.   Chris Weston, chief market strategist at spreadbetter IG, said in  a morning note that the Nikkei's sell-off can likely be explained  by the strength of the Japanese yen as a result of a fall in the  dollar.   The dollar slipped 1.65 percent overnight against a basket of  currencies as weak U.S. economic data suggested a March interest  rate hike from the data-dependent Federal Reserve was unlikely.  The ISM non-manufacturing index's January reading came in at  53.5, below the expected 55.1 and the lowest reading since  December 2013.  Weston said, though, that dollar had been "taken to the cleaners"  even before the release of U.S. data.   "The selling in the USD has been ferocious. It's been one way and  whether it was driven by oil selling, liquidity, a full  re-pricing of U.S. rate hikes, or some more mysterious theme, the  USD selling has resonated in markets," he said.Some analysts think the fall in the dollar might have some staying power.  HSBC Private Bank's head of investment strategy in Asia, Banjamin  Pedley told CNBC's "Squawk Box" that the dollar's fall overnight is  something that had been anticipated."It does seem as though that move last night is typically a  meaningful move that I think signs off on the final page, if you  will, for that dollar bull run that was in place for much of the  past few years," said Pedley.   In Japan, shares of Sharp retraced early gains of as much as 24 percent  to close up 16.79 percent after Japanese broadcaster NHK  initially reported that the troubled electronics maker had  accepted a takeover offer by Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry, better known as  Foxconn, and rejected a rescue plan by a Japanese state-backed  fund after months of uncertainty over the company's fate. Foxconn  offered to invest over 700 billion yen ($5.94 billion) in Sharp,  according to NHK.   Later Reuters reported Sharp said no final decision has been made  to be rescued by Foxconn, but that a source said Foxconn gained  negotiating rights.  Toshiba shares rose 2.90 percent, retracing early losses of as much as 5.59 percent.  The company said it is looking into whether to deepen its  full-year loss forecast. The company is set to report its  earnings later in the day. Japanese news media Kyodo News and the  Nikkei reported that the company will deepen its net loss  projection to over 600 billion yen ($5.1 billion), from the  current forecast of 550 billion yen in losses, for the year  ending March 31.   The dollar-yen pair traded at 117.90, down from levels over 120 earlier this week. Japanese export  stocks were mixed with shares of Toyota down 2.14 percent, while Canon added 1.10 percent. A stronger yen is usually a negative for exporters  as it trims their overseas revenue when converted back to local  currency.   Down Under, resources stocks were also trading mostly higher,  with Rio  Tinto and BHP Billiton gaining 8.91 and 8.27 percent  respectively.  Fortescue shares  closed up 11.73 percent as iron ore prices saw a rebound. Dalian  iron ore futures for May delivery were up as much as 3.98 percent  at 340 yuan ($52) a tonne, off the session high of 341 yuan. It  was at its strongest level since October 20. The spot iron price was  also up, with iron ore for immediate delivery to China's Tianjin  port at $44, the highest since November 23.  Oil prices continued their upward trend from overnight during Asian hours with U.S. crude futures rising 0.65 percent to $32.49 a barrel, following an 8 percent increase during U.S. hours. Global benchmark Brent was up 0.46 percent at $35.20 a barrel after gaining 7.1 percent overnight.Most energy plays saw rebounds, with shares of  Santos up 13.36 percent, Oil Search up 7.14 percent, Hong Kong-listed CNOOC gaining 6.07 percent and Inpex, which is set to report earnings today, gaining 2.90 percent.   But oversupply remains and with no signs of imminent production  cuts from OPEC,  Weston said volatility in crude could easily see prices gaining  or declining by 5-10 percent in the Asian session on  Thursday.   Major indexes in the U.S. finished mixed, with the  gaining 183.12 points, or 1.13 percent, to 16,336.6.  The S&P 500  was up 9.5 points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,912.53, while the    slipped 12.71 points, or 0.28 percent, to 4,504.24.   On the earnings front, major brands across the region are  expected to release data, including Sharp, Tata Steel and  Singapore Airlines.  — Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.
