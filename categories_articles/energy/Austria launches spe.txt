WindThe windmill called Windpark Handalm is situated in the mountains of southern Austria. It represents one of the latest renewable energy projects funded by the EU, as stated by the European Commission on Tuesday.Windpark Handalm will generate enough power for 21,000 homes, saving annually 46,000 tonnes of CO2, comparable with taking 8,000 cars off the road. 

The Austrian windfarm has 13 windmills situated at an approximate height of 1800 meters and capable to generate 76 megawatt-hours of electricity a year, illustrating inventive technologies dedicated for high altitude location, the Commission affirms. The project, which commenced before schedule on 24th of October, will also show the applicative value of the technologies for high altitude wind farms in special wind and weather conditions of mountainous regions.

The Handalm investment estimated at EUR58 million, out of which EUR11.3 million was offered by a grant from the NER 300 program, encourages the development of inventive low-carbon technologies and is fully financed through the sale of emissions fees in correspondence with EU's emissions trading scheme (EU ETS).

The EC emphasized that the assistance for advancement and implementation of innovative low-carbon technologies is an important part of the EU's strategy meant to ensure the fulfillment of its climate change objectives as established under the world Paris Agreement.
