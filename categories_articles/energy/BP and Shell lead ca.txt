RenewableBP and Shell are among the founding members of a new lobby group aiming to persuade the UK government to create a "world-leading hydrogen economy" by investing heavily in H2 technology and production, with a view to meeting 100% of the country's heating needs from hydrogen.The Hydrogen Taskforce, which was announced on Monday, unveiled a 34-page report setting out why the government should -- as part of its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 -- introduce five new policies to enable hydrogen solutions to be deployed at a commercial scale:
 
Development of a cross-departmental hydrogen strategy to ensure joined-up thinking across government
 
A commitment to spend PS1bn ($1.27bn) on capital-expenditure funding for hydrogen production, storage and distribution projects
 
Financial support for the production of hydrogen -- for power generation, transport, industrial use and blending into the gas grid.
 
Amending regulations to enable hydrogen to be blended into the UK gas grid and "to take the next steps towards 100% hydrogen heating through supporting public trials and mandating hydrogen-ready boilers by 2025".
