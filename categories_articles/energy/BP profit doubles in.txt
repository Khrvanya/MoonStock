Oil MarketOil major BP PLC on Tuesday said higher oil prices and a positive operating performance led to a doubling in the company's quarterly profit.For the three months to September, BP's replacement cost profit was USD3.09 billion, more than double the USD1.38 billion it posted the same period a year prior. Compared to the second quarter of 2018, the figure was 73% higher.
 
On an underlying basis, BP's replacement cost profit was USD3.84 billion, from USD1.87 billion year-on-year and USD2.82 billion in the second quarter.
 
Profit attributable to shareholders came in at USD3.35 billion for the second quarter, around double the USD1.77 billion in the third quarter of 2017 and 20% up quarter-on-quarter.
 
BP's production was flat year-on-year at 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, but on an underlying basis was 6.8% higher. The underlying figure excludes BP's stake in Russian firm Rosneft and portfolio changes.
 
Looking ahead, BP expects fourth-quarter production to rise on the third quarter, due to the acquisition of BHP Billiton PLC assets in the US. This USD10.5 billion acquisition, announced in July, is expected to complete on Wednesday.
