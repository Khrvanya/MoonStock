Natural GasEnergy major BP has approved its first most important project this year, a natural gas field in Oman that will endorse the loss of other assets in the Middle East.The British firm and Oman Oil Company Exploration & Production have agreed on the second stage of the onshore Khazzan project, which will launch production in 2021. The new investment will bolster total production the site by 50 per cent to 1.5 billion cubic feet a day (255,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day).

BP wishes gas to lead its output slate in the years ahead as worldwide transition includes lowering carbon fuels. Six of the seven projects it launched in 2017 were gas-producing. It plans to start five more this year, three of which are gas-oriented.

Khazzan is unique because it's one of the few fields which are not located in the US that uses innovative technology. While the rocks BP is drilling into aren't shale, it has applied hydraulic fracturing to sharply increase production at the site.

BP did not reveal which will be the cost for the new Oman development, called Ghazeer. The two stages will jointly produce an overall quantity of 10.5 trillion cubic feet of gas and 350 million barrels of condensate.
