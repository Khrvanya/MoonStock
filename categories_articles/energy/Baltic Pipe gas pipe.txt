Natural GasThe final investment decision (FID) for the natural gas pipeline project between Denmark and Poland, the Baltic Pipe, might be taken no later than December 2018.Jeppe Dano, the marketing director of the Danish national transmission system operator for electricity and natural gas Energinet, spoke during the 9th Baltic Energy Summit in Lithuania's capital Vilnius, where he provided new information about the Baltic Pipe project. He affirmed that if the FID goes as planned, construction will begin in 2020 and the pipeline will transport first gas in 2022.

Energinet representative declared that the new pipeline would offer Denmark and Poland the possibility to link straight to Norway's gas. The 6,800-kilometer-long pipeline will facilitate the supply of gas from Norway to the Polish market via Denmark, and to customers in neighboring countries, such as Sweden.

The project is likely to have a positive impact in four geographical areas - Norway, Poland, Denmark and the European Union. The unit will also keep low gas transmission tariffs as domestic Danish gas production and consumption decreases in the coming years. For Polish shareholders, it signifies enhanced security of supply and improved gas market competition. The project aims to back the achievement of the EU Energy Union target. 

Dano also considers that direct access to new central and eastern European markets with planned additional gas demand may benefit the Norwegian actors. 

The Baltic Pipe project would extend Europe's gas transfer capacity by almost 10 billion cubic meters of gas per year,. Meanwhile, the total Danish gas consumption for 2016 was estimated at 2.5 billion cubic meters.
