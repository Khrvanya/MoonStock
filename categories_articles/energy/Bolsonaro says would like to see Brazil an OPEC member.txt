Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said on Wednesday that he would like Brazil to join the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).      "I personally would very much like Brazil to become a member of OPEC," Bolsonaro said at an investment conference in Riyadh.      He said he would have to consult with his economy and energy ministers to ensure they could follow through if a decision was made.
