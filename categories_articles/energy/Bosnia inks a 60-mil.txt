WindBosnia's finance minister Vjekoslav Bevanda inked an agreement with German development bank KfW on Wednesday to financially back the construction of the Hrgud 48 MW wind farm. The loan is estimated at 60 million euros ($69.6 million).  Bosnia's Serb Republic received the loan, while the project will be implemented by the entity's energy utility Elektroprivreda Republike Srpske.

The wind farm, with a yearly net production of around 126 GWh, will extend on an area of almost five square kilometers and should be accomplished in the next four years. 

Vjekoslav Bevanda also inked a grant deal of 13.5 million euros with KfW to fund wastewater project in the city of Zenica.

Zenica has already obtained a 4.75-million-euro backing for the project from the Swiss government. The project is planned to continue the building and reconstruction of the most important wastewater collectors in Zenica, as well as the edification of a wastewater treatment site, and the total separation of urban waste water from industrial wastewater.

Zenica represents the fourth biggest city in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the administrative centre of the Zenica-Doboj Canton situated in one of Bosnia's two entities, the Federation. The other is the Serb Republic. 

Elektroprivreda Republike Srpske activates in the Serb Republic, while Elektroprivreda HZHB and Elektroprivreda BiH function in the Federation.
