The country has reduced emissions from its power sector, by increasing renewable power such as wind, but has struggled to cut emissions in the heating and industrial sectors.
 
The bulk of the money, 70 million pounds, will help fund two low-carbon hydrogen plants, in the Mersey, in the north of England and one near Aberdeen in Scotland, and a project to produce hydrogen using offshore wind power.
 
Hydrogen is a zero emission alternative to fossil fuel. It seen as a possible clean energy source for the future but it is currently too expensive for widespread use.
 
The remaining 20 million pounds will be used to fund projects to cut household emissions.
