CoalBritish energy supplier SSE Plc plans to shut its Fiddler's Ferry coal-fired plant in northwest England by March 2020, saying the loss-making plant could not compete with more efficient gas and renewable energy options.Britain plans to close all coal-fired power plants by 2025 as a part of efforts to meet its climate goals and coal plants have become increasingly uneconomic due to levies on carbon dioxide emissions.
 
"Financially, the station is making significant losses. ..At nearly 50 years old, the station is unable to compete with more efficient and modern gas and renewable generation," Stephen Wheeler, Managing Director of Thermal Energy at SSE said.
 
The plant failed to secure any contracts beyond September 2019 under Britain's capacity market, which pays generators to be available during times of peak demand, and lost around 40 million pounds in SSE's financial year ending March 31, the company said.
