EnergySSE Plc inked an agreement with Innogy SE to establish a new energy firm, an action which will represent the major shakeup of the industry in over a decade.The two companies uniting their efforts will form the second largest household supplier in the UK, following Centrica Plc's British Gas unit, with accounts of around 11.5 million. SSE stake owners will own 66 percent and Innogy will obtain a stake of 34% in the new company.
 
The adopted decision is a reaction to U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May's plans to lower domestic prices to protect millions of households from exaggerated prices. As consequence, Top 6 will become Top 5 leading providers.

Peter Terium, chief executive officer of Innogy, said Wednesday in a statement: "When we look at the competitive landscape and the uncertain political environment for energy retailers in Great Britain, it is clear that Npower would be better placed to offer value to our customers and our shareholders as part of a new company,".

The transaction should be accomplished in the fourth quarter of next year or early 2019. SSE expects more than 100 million pounds ($131 million) income in synergies by combining the two retail companies. 

According to Meredith Annex, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance in London, since 2010, Innogy's Npower has lost 25 percent of its retail base, while SSE has lost a fifth. Centrica Plc's British Gas division has 13.8 million customers.
