NuclearChina General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) is interested in an equity stake in the NuGen site at Moorside in Cumbria (UK). There are also other companies which hope to purchase Toshiba's NuGen stake, including the South Korean company Kepco. 

CGN is known for being present in the UK nuclear sector, possessing 33.5% stake in the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station project and a 20% interest in the Sizewell project. China Corporation plans to get a 66.5% share in a JV company at Bradwell-on-Sea (Essex, UK).

To strengthen its position in Britain, CGN has recently created 3 affiliates:  Bradley Power Corporation, General Nuclear System Ltd and General Nuclear International.

The development of three Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear reactors of 1,200 MW each in Moorside is the NuGen responsibility.  

Because of the forced buy back of NuGen 40% from Engie, Toshiba became the sole owner of the nuclear project, a fact that will hamper managing the US$15bn - US$20bn project.
