The independent region lies to the northwest of China, the largest energy consumer globally. It has different resources counting gold, platinum, silver, uranium and coal, in addition to oil.

Various factors, such as region's resources, cheaper labor and strategic geographical position, which offer China direct link to Central Asian countries as well as Afghanistan and Pakistan, led to an economic expansion in Xinjiang over the last ten years. This growth attracted internal migration of Han Chinese from the nation's eastern areas, leading to conflicts with Uighur community.
