WindChina's investment in foreign wind-powered electricity markets has approached $7 billion in Europe alone as private and stated-owned Chinese companies move "aggressively" to capitalize on fast-growing renewable energy markets.According to the report published by the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), the European Union ($6.8 billion) and Australia ($5.1 billion) were the main recipients of Chinese wind investment from 2011 to 2017.
 
China's foreign renewable energy investments have increased as a result of the country's pan-Asian Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), but the majority of these investments are in non-BRI countries, with Europe taking the biggest share, the research shows.
 
According to the report, China's state-owned independent power producers have acquired big wind projects in nine European countries, aiming especially to diversify their foreign portfolios and gain expertise in offshore wind technology.
 
From 2010 to 2017, only 30 percent of Chinese foreign investment in renewables was in BRI countries, the report said, adding top recipients included Pakistan ($1.9 billion), Malaysia ($0.7 billion), Turkey ($0.6 billion), India ($0.4 billion), and Vietnam ($0.4 billion). The remaining 70 percent went to non-BRI countries.
 
The brief builds on an IEEFA paper published in January that described how China has become a leading global renewable energy investor, "defying an overall slowdown in Chinese overseas investment as the country further positioned itself to dominate in new energy technologies such as batteries and electric vehicles".
 
That report put China's 2017 investment in large clean energy projects in foreign countries (greater than $1 billion) at $44 billion, up from $32 billion in 2016.
 
Last week's report added that between 2015 and 2017, a total of $34 billion was invested in BRI countries, whereas $61 billion went to non-BRI countries.
