Natural GasApproximately 200 billion cubic meters of natural gas has been conveyed from Central Asia to China within a major energy project, as stated by China National Petroleum Corporation.The China-Central Asia pipelines, which started operations in December 2009, represent China's first overland international gas project and is made up of three routes with a total yearly capacity of 55 billion cubic meters. The pipelines traverse states like Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. 

The gas pipeline begins in Turkmen-Uzbek border city of Gedaim, crosses Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan and passes the Chinese-Kazakh frontier in Khorgas city. The gas pipeline is 1,830 kilometers long, while its overall capacity is estimated at 55 billion cubic meters a year.

The gas infrastructure can meet the demand of over 300 million people. Line D is presently under construction and once finalized is expected to provide 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas every year. 

Calculations show that 200 billion cubic meters of natural gas might substitute around 266 million tons of coal, and could reduce 284 million tons of carbon dioxide and 4.4 million tons of sulfur dioxide.

Turkmenistan with a share of 77 percent is the key supplier for the gas pipeline, while Uzbekistan holds 12 percent, and Myanmar - 10 percent. The level of gas consumption in China is likely to raise to 340 billion cubic meters in 2020, while 120 billion cubic meters will be imported.
