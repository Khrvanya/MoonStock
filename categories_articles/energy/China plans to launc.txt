CO2China made a comprehensive strategy for world's largest emissions trading system. More than 1,700 power companies and three billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions are expected to be covered by the system.According to Director of Climate Department at China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), trading will start after preparation period and will continuously enlarge its network to include other high energy consuming and high emission industries.

The existing EU Emissions Trading System, which is presently the largest carbon market, covers approximately 1.75 billion tonnes of emissions.

Dirk Forrister, President and CEO of the International Emissions Trading Association affirmed: "China joins a growing number of jurisdictions, such as California, the EU and South Korea, which are using market-based measures to cut climate emissions in a cost-effective and efficient way. China will have the world's largest carbon market, drawing lessons from these other markets to ensure that it works in harmony with other national policies."
