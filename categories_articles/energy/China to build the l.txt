SolarA unit of China Three Gorges is constructing the world's biggest floating solar plant estimated at 1 billion yuan (US$151 million), located in the country's eastern province of Anhui.China Three Gorges New Energy commenced the edification of the 150-megawatt project in July and part of the plant has been linked to the electricity network. The project consists of panels fixed to floats on the surface of a lake that appeared after the collapse of a coal mine. The whole facility is likely to start operating by May 2018.

Floating solar technology is expanding in China, where ground-mounted initiatives are not applied at full extent due to grid congestion. Approximately 5.6 per cent of solar power production was ineffective in the first three quarters of the year, as stated by the National Energy Administration.

The China's former largest commissioned floating solar site was a 40-megawatt farm built by Sungrow Power Supply Co. in the same province.
