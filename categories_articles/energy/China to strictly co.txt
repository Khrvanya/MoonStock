SolarChina will strictly control the future expansion of solar power generation capacity and encourage more innovation, to enhance technology and reduce production costs in its rapidly-growing solar sector.The guideline set by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), follows the United States in establishing steep tariffs on solar panel imports in late January.

The guidelines specify a minimum research and development (R&D) investment amount for solar firms of 10 million yuan ($1.58 million) each year, and minimum performance standards such as solar cell efficiency and the attenuation rate of solar products.

Over the past three years, China has been encouraging solar companies to generate high-efficiency products by granting subsidies and awarding government contracts.

China, the world's largest solar products maker, generated an overall amount of 87 gigawatts (GW) of silicon wafers and 68 GW of solar cells last year. At present, it has a total of 130.3 GW of installed solar capacity.

The ministry's new guidelines will be implemented from Thursday.
