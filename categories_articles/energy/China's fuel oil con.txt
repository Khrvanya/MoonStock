Energy MarketChina's apparent consumption of fuel oil, excluding consumption for bonded bunker fuel, is expected to grow to 30 million mt in 2019, up 9% from 27.5 million mt expected in 2018, Shandong Longzhong Information Technology's fuel oil product analyst Tian Qiujin said this week.Tian said the growth of domestic bunker fuel oil consumption will contribute to the total increase. Out of 27.5 million mt of fuel oil consumption in 2018, 66% is expected to be consumed in the domestic bunker sector, she said.

"Marine fuel oil has become the main direction of development with an average annual growth of 6% from 2015-2018," Tian said.
 
Fuel oil demand for refinery feedstock has remained weak, she added.
 
For bonded bunker fuel, Zhoushan has been seeing a jump in sales volume, Tian said. "The government is promoting and supporting the port to grow as a bunkering hub," she said.
 
The government is providing incentives and supportive policies for companies to move their bunkering operations to Zhoushan, a bunker trader said.
 
Zhoushan's bunker fuel prices are typically $3-$6/mt lower than Shanghai, to compete with China's biggest port, bunker traders said.
 
Chimbusco and Sinopec Zhoushan are the main suppliers in the port with each operating 150,000-200,000 mt of storage, industry sources said.
