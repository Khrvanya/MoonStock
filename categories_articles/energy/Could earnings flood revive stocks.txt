  Stocks limp into the busiest day of the earnings season after  throwing a tantrum over the Fed's cautious remarks about a  slowing economy.  Earnings have been a mixed bag with disappointment in Boeing's  forward guidance Wednesday pounding that stock. But a beat  after the bell by Facebook, sparked a more than 10 percent rally in its  stock after the close, and could help inject some positive  momentum into the market Thursday.  Early morning earnings are expected from Caterpillar, Ford,  Bristol-Myers Squibb, AutoNation, Eli Lilly, Johnson Controls,  Blackstone, Deutsche Bank, Diageo, Hershey, Raytheon, Northrop  Grumman, Abbott Labs, Celgene, Pulte Group and Northrop Grumman,  among others. Amazon.com reports after Thursday's market close,  as does Microsoft, Visa, Amgen, and Electronic Arts.
