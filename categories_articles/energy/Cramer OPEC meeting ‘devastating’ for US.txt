  U.S. oil companies are going to be in a world of pain for a long  time, especially after the latest OPEC meeting, CNBC's Jim Cramer  said Monday.  "This is not 'longer and lower;' this is 'longer and much lower.'  There's companies that are not going to be able to fund with  futures; there're companies that are not going to be able to get  credit," Cramer said on "Squawk on the Street."  Cramer made his remarks after the Organization of the Petroleum  Exporting Countries decided not to lower production on Friday.  "This was a devastating blow for the U.S. oil industry," Cramer  said.  "There is no cartel," Cramer said of OPEC. "The cartel was meant to keep the price  controlled. They ended the cartel, and that's why this is  happening." US crude futures in 2015
