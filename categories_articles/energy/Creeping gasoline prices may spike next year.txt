  After a year of relatively cheap driving, gasoline prices are  creeping higher and consumers could even see a price spike  by mid-2017.  Prices should be up in the new year, in large part because of  higher oil prices but also because of the growing export market  for U.S.-refined gasoline. Last week, the U.S. exported a record 1.1  million barrels a day, most likely to Mexico and South  America. Some experts say there could be a temporary jump of 20 percent or  more in the national average at some point in the spring  when driving season picks up. Demand is softer in the winter  months, but prices could get a bit higher through January and February.
