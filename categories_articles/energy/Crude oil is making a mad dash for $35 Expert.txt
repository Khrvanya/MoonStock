 Crude oil prices  fell 2 percent Tuesday to their lowest level since late August as  concerns over supply and demand continued to weigh on the market.  Oil is now down 16 percent from its Oct. 9 high, and one expert  warns the commodity could hit sub-$40 levels sooner than  later.   "I think we're going to continue to go lower and hit $40 and then  [retest the August low]," Andy Lipow said Tuesday on CNBC's  "Futures Now."

"Those supplies combined with the robust exports of diesel from  Saudi Arabia and the U.S. have produced a glut of diesel fuel and  jet fuel," Lipow added. "This is just bad news for  the energy  complex."   As a result of that oversupply, Lipow expects refiners around the  world to decrease demand, which should cause further weakness in  the physical oil market.Read More  "With OPEC doing  nothing to reduce production and the impending return of Iranian  oil to the market in 2016, prices will make another run at $40  pretty quickly," he said. "I  think that the worst period for crude oil will be in 1Q 2016 when  refineries in the USA undergo a significant maintenance period  and crude oil demand is once again reduced."  Lipow expects crude oil to continue to fall as low as $35 a  barrel in the coming months. That's 18 percent lower from  its current price of around $43. To note, a decline that severe  would put the commodity at its lowest level since 2009.
