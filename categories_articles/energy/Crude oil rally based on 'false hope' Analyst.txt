  Oil prices rallied more than 12 percent Friday on renewed  prospects for an output cut among the world's oil producers, but  analysts and market watchers told CNBC that traders shouldn't  hold out hope.  Crude prices spiked Thursday afternoon after UAE Energy Minister  Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazrouei said consensus was forming within  OPEC that it was time to discuss cuts with nonmembers. He also  said current low prices had forced some members to cap  production.  Michael Cohen, Barclays head of energy commodities research, said  he was not moved by the latest news, which follows a string of  similar comments from oil ministers and petroleum executives in  recent weeks.  "We think it's a lot of false hope. Basically what's been  happening over the last month is, as the market's gotten  increasingly short, anytime that we see these kinds of headlines,  they result in this kind of rapid change in the price," he told  CNBC's "Squawk on the  Street" on Friday.  Cohen said there was simply too much distrust between de  facto OPEC leader and top oil exporter  Saudi Arabia and No. 1 producer Russia, which he noted has agreed  to cuts in the past, but has only enacted very small ones in  reality.  To be sure, short covering also fueled Friday's drive as some  traders believe oil hit a technical bottom Thursday, when  U.S. crude fell  as low as $26.05. It settled above $29 on Friday. Citigroup has  said the bottom is at the $26 level.There was nothing new in Thursday's UAE headline, and the reaction in oil markets has been overblown, John Kilduff, founding partner at advisory firm Again  Capital, said Friday.  "There was a lot of momentum players in this market, and yeah, this is your worst nightmare," he told CNBC's "Fast Money:  Halftime Report." "You see a headline like this and you just got  short the market, you're going to puke your position. That's what  we're seeing here today."He said Saudi Arabia will not be content until it is certain it has inflicted enough pain on competitors, particularly U.S. drillers, whose production gains in recent years contributed significantly to an oversupply that OPEC estimates at 2 million barrels a day. Kilduff reiterated his called that oil will fall to $18 a barrel before the market rebalances.  Dennis Gartman, publisher of The Gartman Letter, noted that the  CEO of Russian oil giant Rosneft, Igor Sechin, had recently  changed his tenor, suggesting he could possibly be open to output  cuts. But he too said a production drawdown was unlikely.  Gartman told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Friday that a meeting to discuss  cuts would probably happen and "maybe" yield a productive  outcome, but there was absolutely no chance OPEC members would  abide by quotas.  "If there's one thing we've learned from history, whatever OPEC  says about curtailing production never comes to fruition.  Everybody cheats," Gartman said.   Both Gartman and Cohen noted that Russian producers are  technically unable to reduce production right now because  temperatures are so cold, wells would freeze and need to be  redrilled.  Hilltop Securities Managing Director Mark Grant said Friday he  believes technological innovation in the American oil patch has  broken the established order in crude markets.   "We can produce more oil and deliver more oil than anybody in the  world, which means that all the producing nations — Russia,  Saudi Arabia, Libya, Yemen, you can go through the whole litany  — are toast. And I mean toast because they'll never recover.  And so the whole energy game has changed," he told "Squawk Box."  U.S. drillers still typically face a higher cost of production oil  than OPEC members, and they are feeling the pain. Since last  year, 48 North American oil and gas companies have filed for  bankruptcy, according to law firm Haynes & Boone.  Many of these are shale drillers who rely on an expensive process  called hydraulic fracturing, which entails pumping water,  minerals and chemicals deep underground to break up rock and  free oil and gas.  But BP suggested the current rout could pay off for shale  drillers in the long run, as tough times force them to become  more efficient, Reuters reported. In its 2035 Energy Outlook, BP  forecast shale production would grow to 8 million barrels per day  in the 2030s from about 4 million barrels today, according to the  news agency.— CNBC's Patti Domm contributed reporting to this story.
