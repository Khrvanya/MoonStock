CoalCEZ is to close just over 1 GW of coal-fired capacity by mid-2020, the Czech generator confirmed Wednesday.CEZ general director and board chairman Daniel Benes told Czech newspaper E15 it was not economically viable to operate the capacity beyond the mid-2020 given the cost of upgrades required under European air quality controls. CEZ spokesman Ladislav Kriz confirmed the comments.
 
The broad outlines of Czech plans to close aging coal-fired power plants are outlined in national energy policy, but this is the first time that CEZ has put a figure on short-term closures and named specific plants.
 
Capacity to close by the middle of next year are Prunerov-1, with four units and total capacity of 440 MW, the 500 MW Melnik-3, and one of two 110 MW units at Melnik-2. The remaining Melnik unit is to focus on heat production for Prague, around 40 km away.
 
CEZ coal plants generated 27.7 TWh in 2018 out of the company's total production of 63.1 TWh. The target for 2019 is for coal-fired power plants to produce 29.8 TWh.
