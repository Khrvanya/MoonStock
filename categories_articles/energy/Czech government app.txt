NuclearThe Czech government has given preliminary approval for a plan by a subsidiary of electricity producer CEZ to build a nuclear power station with the government providing guarantees to help it secure cheaper financing.CEZ is 70 percent state-owned and has previously declined to invest in nuclear alone given high costs and unclear returns.
 
A decision on construction of a unit at the Dukovany site is still years away with suppliers expected to be chosen by 2024.
 
The investment into the initial unit with about 1,200 megawatt (MW) output is expected to be billions of dollars.
 
It should replace capacity at Dukovany whose four 500-megawatt units will start decommissioning in 2037, and help energy needs as coal-fired capacity is gradually retired.
