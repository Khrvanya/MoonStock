DailyOil prices rose slightly on Friday after OPEC and other major producers decided to extend output reductions in a widely expected move aimed at ending a persistent glut in global supplies.Brent crude futures edged 46 cents, or 0.7%, up at $63.57 a barrel. Meanwhile, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $57.40 a barrel.

British wholesale gas prices declined on Thursday, weighed down by forecasts for higher temperatures and increased Norwegian flows that led to an oversupplied system. NBP day-ahead gas price dropped by 0.45 pence, or 0.8%, to 56.70 p/therm. Next quarter delivery contract was down by 0.56 pence, or 1%, at 56.02 p/therm.
 
European spot electricity prices for day-ahead delivery edged lower on Thursday on predictions of higher solar, wind and nuclear power generation, while demand is likely to decrease in Germany. The German baseload day-ahead price for Friday delivery tumbled by almost 10% to 61.03 euros/MWh. The equivalent French contract dipped nearly 2 percent to 73.75 euros/MWh.

In the year-ahead power curve prices were mixed. Germany's benchmark power contract for 2018 delivery was almost constant at 36.70 euros/MWh, while the equivalent French contract gained 0.3% to 42.84 euros/MWh.

European carbon prices ended lower on Thursday as EU lawmakers reached an agreement over a less restraining 'Brexit-proofing' modification that is unlikely to limit usable EUA supply or lead to a partitioned market. The contract expiring in 2018 slumped by 2.2% to 7.56 euros a tonne.
