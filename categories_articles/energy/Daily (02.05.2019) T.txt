DailyOil prices declined on Wednesday, after EIA data showed a new record level of oil production since September 2017 and a surge in the crude inventories in the U.S. Brent crude lost 0.9% to trade at $72.18 a barrel, while WTI futures edged 0.5% lower at $.63.60 a barrel. Nevertheless, the losses were limited by the prospect of a weaker oil supply due to increasing unrest in Venezuela and the end of U.S. sanction waivers on countries importing Iranian oil.Wednesday saw a drop in the UK gas prices, as increased Norwegian supplies via the Langeled pipeline left the system oversupplied. Moreover, six LNG cargoes are due to unload in Britain in the next seven days. Against that background, NBP spot dipped by 4.2% to 32.95 p/therm. On the curve, the price for delivery in October 2019 slumped by 2.4% to 42.70 p/therm. 
 
The European spot power prices had a steep upward evolution on Wednesday, boosted by rising demand due to colder weather forecasts. The price for the German spot power contract soared by 49% to 37.94 EUR/MWh, amid falling wind power output. In the meantime, the price for the equivalent French contract spiked by 37.4% to 38.93 EUR/MWh in the context of lower nuclear availability after the start of planned maintenance works at Cruas 3 reactor.
 
No trading occurred for electricity forward contracts due to Labour Day public holiday.
 
The European carbon prices lost ground on Wednesday, influenced by the decline in the gas prices and the low trading activity on Labour Day. The 2021-expiry contract dropped by 2% to 26.42 EUR/tonne.
