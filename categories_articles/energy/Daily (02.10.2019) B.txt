DailyCrude oil prices continued their downward evolution on Tuesday, following the news that U.S. factory data dropped to an over 10-year low in September due to fewer exports in the context of the U.S.-China trade tensions. A subsequent fall in equities market put more pressure on prices. Pessimistic manufacturing and inflation data in the Euro zone also weighed on the market. On the supply side, the declines in oil output from OPEC, Russia and the U.S. could prevent further losses. Brent crude tumbled by 3.1% to $58.89 a barrel. WTI futures traded 0.8% lower at $53.62 a barrel.A fall in temperatures and reduced wind generation lifted the gas demand, helping British gas prices to recover on Tuesday. Consequently, the NBP spot price rebounded by 22.3% to 26.60 p/therm amid an undersupplied system. On the curve, the price for delivery in January 2020 climbed by 1.6% to 53.37 p/therm.
 
European spot electricity prices lost momentum on Tuesday, weighed by robust wind and thermal power supplies. The price for the German day-ahead power contract sank by 4% to 40.86 EUR/MWh, on expectations for limited demand. The equivalent French contract settled 3.2% lower at 38.69 EUR/MWh.
 
Forward electricity prices also weakened on Tuesday, as bearish oil prices offset the upward stimulus from firmer carbon and gas markets. The German power contract for delivery in 2020 retreated by 0.5% to 47.98 EUR/MWh. The equivalent French contract moved slightly downwards to 50.80 EUR/MWh.
 
The EU carbon prices recovered after a fresh four-month low, as buyers hunted for bargains. The price for the contract expiring in 2020 rose by 1.2% to 25.26 EUR/tonne.
