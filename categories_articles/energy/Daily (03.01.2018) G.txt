DailyOil prices edged lower on Tuesday after hitting mid-2015 peaks in early trading, as major pipelines in Libya and the UK restarted and U.S output increased to the highest level in more than four decades. Brent crude futures ended down 40 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $66.57 a barrel. The session peak of $67.29 was the highest since May 2015. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures closed 5 cents lower at $60.37 a barrel. In early trading, WTI hit $60.74, the highest level since June 2015.
 
Higher temperatures and abundant flows from Norway on Tuesday contributed to a decline in British wholesale gas prices. Day-ahead gas price slumped by 1.35 pence, or 2.5%, to 53.65 p/therm. Along the forward curve, the February contract traded 1.07 pence, or 1.9%, down at 55.25p/therm. 
 
European wholesale power prices fell sharply on Tuesday, under pressure from huge wind power production in Germany and milder weather in Europe. German baseload power for day-ahead delivery tumbled by 73.2 percent to 8.97 euros/MWh). The French equivalent dropped by around 49% percent to 16.52 euros/MWh.

According to traders, forwards were responding to substantial declines in oil and carbon emissions rights prices.

EU carbon prices slumped below EUR8 on Tuesday, to give back some of a pre-Christmas rally that led prices to a two-year peak. The carbon contract expiring in 2019 settled 3.8% lower at 7.87 euros a tonne.
