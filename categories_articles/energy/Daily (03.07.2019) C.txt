DailyCrude oil prices posted an important loss on Tuesday, pressured by global oil demand concerns raised by weaker factory activity in Europe and Asia in June as well as by downbeat U.S. manufacturing data nearing a three-year low. Moreover, investors seemed to be rather disappointed that OPEC didn't agree on larger output cuts. As a result, WTI futures plunged by 4.8% to $56.25 a barrel, while Brent crude tumbled by 4.1% to $62.40 a barrel.UK forward gas prices lost ground on Tuesday, amid ample storages and expectations for steady LNG arrivals in the next two weeks. The contract for delivery in Winter 2019 traded 2.2% lower at 48.63 p/therm. Meanwhile, the NBP spot price inched up by 0.8% to 26.90 p/therm, due to tighter Norwegian flows after an unplanned outage at Aasta Hansteen gas field. Moreover, the ongoing maintenance works at Nyhamna gas plant and Troll field also lent support to the day-ahead contract.
 
The European prompt power prices diverged on Tuesday. Forecasts for reduced wind power output led to a 3.9% surge in the price for the German spot power contract, which closed at 34.66 EUR/MWh. In the meantime, the price for the equivalent French contract slumped by 6.3% to 31.82 EUR/MWh, due to increased nuclear availability and rising wind generation.
 
On the curve, electricity prices posted losses, influenced by a weaker energy complex. The price for the German power contract for delivery in 2020 slipped by 0.1% to 49.47 EUR/MWh, while the equivalent French contract settled 0.3% lower at 51.90 EUR/MWh.
 
EU carbon prices declined after an early rally on Tuesday, amid technical selling and falling energy prices. The price for the 2019-expiry contract decreased by 0.7% to 26.72 EUR/tonne.
