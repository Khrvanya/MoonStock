DailyOil prices increased on Thursday, steadying close to two-year peaks as OPEC-led supply reductions have tightened the market and weakened inventories. Brent crude closed 13 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $60.62 per barrel. The benchmark reached $61.70 on Wednesday, its highest intraday level since July 2015. U.S. crude rose by 24 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $54.54. Both contracts edged by more than 30% higher compared to their 2017-lows in June.
 
British wholesale gas prices edged up on Thursday because of lower wind power production and increased demand. NBP day-ahead gas price surged 0.97 pence, or 2%, to end at 49.33 pence per therm. Further along the curve, Summer 2018 delivery contract settled 0.6% higher at 43.14 p/therm.

The German spot power contract price for day-ahead delivery surged on Thursday to its highest level since February, supported by forecasts indicating a sharp decline in electricity generation from wind turbines amid increasing demand and cold weather. The German baseload contract for Friday delivery soared 48 percent to 50.44 euros/MWh, or almost a nine-month peak. The French day-ahead prompt power price for Friday delivery rose by 1.61 euros to 57.18 euros/MWh.

Along the forward electricity curve, the German baseload power for delivery in 2018 ticked up 0.13 percent to 37.20 euros/MWh, following gains in carbon emissions prices. The equivalent French power contract was almost unchanged at 42.10 euros/MWh.

EU carbon gained for a third successive session on Thursday to reach a two-week peak as purchasers emerged and traders unwound short positions after higher electricity prices helped carbon cross a key technical level. EU carbon allowances expiring in 2018 settled 2% higher at 7.70 euros a tonne.
