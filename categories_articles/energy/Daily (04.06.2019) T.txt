DailyCrude oil prices continued to fall on Monday, under the heavy influence from the ongoing demand-side concerns stoked by U.S.-China trade tensions and threats of U.S. tariffs on Mexico. Brent crude slumped by 5% to $61.28 a barrel, while WTI futures traded 0.5% lower at $53.25 a barrel.Higher flows from Norway via the Langeled and Vesterled pipelines led to an oversupplied system, pushing UK gas prices down to multiannual lows on Monday. Moreover, increased wind generation and, consequently, weak demand from power plants also weighed on prices. Against that bearish background, NBP spot lost 2.9% settling at 26.23 p/therm. Along the curve, the contract price for delivery in October 2019 retreated by 2.1% to 38.74 p/therm.
 
A decline in supply bolstered the European day-ahead power prices on Monday, while consumption was seen on the rise after a holiday last week. The German spot power contract soared by 30.1% to 38.99 EUR/MWh, stimulated by reduced wind power output. In the meantime, the price for the equivalent French contract surged by 23.3% to 35.60 EUR/MWh, amid limited nuclear availability over the summer maintenance season.
 
On the curve, electricity prices remained bearish, tracking the steep decline in carbon prices and a weaker energy complex. The German power contract for delivery in 2020 closed at 46.47 EUR/MWh, posting a 1.7% daily loss. The price for the equivalent French contract decreased by 1.8% to 49.35 EUR/MWh.
 
EU carbon prices extended their decline on Monday, dipping to a two-month low, in expectation of the highest auction supply in 2019 to date in the current week. Slack demand from the power sector due to the transitional season between heating and cooling put more pressure on prices. The 2019-expiry contract price plunged by 2.9% to 23.74 EUR/tonne.
