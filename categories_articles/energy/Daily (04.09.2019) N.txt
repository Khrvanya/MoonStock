DailyCrude oil prices extended losses on Tuesday, as weaker manufacturing data in the U.S. and the eurozone reported for August worsened the crude demand outlook. Brent crude traded 0.7% down at $58.26 a barrel, while WTI futures dipped by 1.6% to $53.94 a barrel amid dragging U.S.-China trade talks.  British wholesale gas prices varied on Tuesday. Higher output from wind turbines reduced demand from gas-fired plants, pushing the NBP spot 3.8% lower at 20.50 p/therm. On the other side, the contract price  for delivery in Winter 2019 edged up by 0.4% at 44.97 p/therm stimulated by the upward move in carbon prices, while bearish oil prices and expectations for more LNG arrivals capped gains. 
 
European spot electricity prices fell back on Tuesday, pressured by stronger wind and nuclear power output along with limited demand. The French prompt power price fell by 3.9% to 34.01 EUR/MWh. In the meantime, the German equivalent contract plunged by 9.1% to 33.08 EUR/MWh.  
 
Further on the curve, power prices slightly diverged on Tuesday, influenced by a volatile carbon market and mixed gas prices. The German Cal 2020 delivery contract advanced by 0.1% to 47.06 EUR/MWh, while the French equivalent contract was 0.1% down at 48.80 EUR/MWh. 
 
European carbon prices struggled to recover after an earlier 2.5-month low on Tuesday, amid volatile trading and bearish technical signals.

The price for the contract expiring in 2020 slid by 0.2% to 25.47 EUR/tonne.
