DailyCrude oil prices rebounded from the earlier four-month low on Tuesday, on the back of stronger U.S. stock markets after China's call for dialogue with the U.S. to solve the trade dispute. Firmer expectations for an interest rate cut following the comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman also boosted market sentiment. Brent crude rose by 1.1% to $61.97 a barrel, while WTI futures edged up by 0.4% to $53.48 a barrel.Tuesday saw a recovery in British gas prices, which jumped from the multiannual lows hit on Monday, amid a rather balanced system and robust gas-for-power demand driven by weaker wind generation. The NBP spot price spiked by 12.5% to 29.50 p/therm, in the context of steady coal-to-gas switching. Further on the curve, the contract for delivery in September 2019 traded 3.2% higher at 35.33 p/therm.
 
European day-ahead power prices fell on Tuesday. The price for the German spot power contract dropped by 2.7% to 37.93 EUR/MWh, influenced by an expected steep rise in power generation from renewable sources. At the same time, the equivalent French contract lost 1.4% to settle at 35.11 EUR/MWh, due to increased nuclear availability after the restart of Nogent 2 reactor.
 
On the curve, electricity prices turned bullish, stimulated by the surge on the carbon market and a firmer energy complex. The German power contract for delivery in 2020 advanced by 0.8% to end at 46.86 EUR/MWh. The same gain was seen in the equivalent French contract, which closed at 49.75 EUR/MWh.
 
EU carbon prices reversed trend to rise from a fresh two-month low on Tuesday, supported by a stronger energy complex. The contract price expiring in 2020 hiked by 3.5% to 24.84 EUR/tonne.
