DailyCrude oil prices declined in a thin trading due to a public holiday in the U.S. on Thursday, influenced by a smaller-than-anticipated drop in the U.S. crude inventories. Concerns of a scarce demand stoked by weaker U.S. factory orders and slower business growth in Europe also weighed on prices. However, this week's decision on the extension of OPEC+ output cuts limited losses. Against that background, Brent crude lost 0.8% to settle at $63.30 a barrel, while WTI futures ended 0.9% lower at $56.80 a barrel.British forward gas prices had a bullish evolution on Thursday, amid reduced LNG supply. The contract for delivery in June 2020 gained 1.2% to close at 40.87 p/therm. On the other side, NBP spot price dropped by 1.5% to 27.10 p/therm, as firmer wind generation weighed on gas-for-power demand. Still, another forthcoming outage at the Troll field could temper further losses.
 
Forecasts for tighter renewables generation lifted the European day-ahead power prices. The price for the German prompt power contract jumped by 3.8% to 35.26 EUR/MWh. At the same time, the price for the equivalent French contract spiked by 8.2% to 33.83 EUR/MWh, as the outage at Gravelines 6 reactor was extended by two days until July 6.
 
Forward electricity prices remained bearish on Thursday, in response to the downward movements on the oil and carbon markets. The German power contract for delivery in 2020 closed 0.2% lower at 48.37 EUR/MWh, while the price for the equivalent French contract retreated by 0.1% to 50.91 EUR/MWh.
 
EU carbon prices extended losses in a weak auction on Thursday, as the late June rally lost momentum. The price for the contract expiring in 2020 fell by 1.8% to 26.36 EUR/tonne.
