DailyOil prices dropped on Wednesday after an unpredicted rise in U.S. crude exports to a record 2 million barrels per day fanned fears about global oversupply. Higher U.S. crude production has pressured on WTI prices, while Brent's price has been very much influenced by policy directions over output reductions led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
 
Brent crude price settled 20 cents, or 0.4% lower at $55.80 a barrel. Meanwhile, WTI crude closed 44 cents, or 0.9%, down at $49.98 a barrel.
 
Increasing coal prices and forecasts for cooler weather led to a rise in the wholesale prompt gas prices on Wednesday. NBP day-ahead price rose by 0.35 pence, or 0.8%, to end at 46.80 pence/therm. Along the forward curve, Summer 2018 delivery contract edged 0.13 pence, or 0.3%, down at 41.66 pence per therm.
 
European spot power prices for day-ahead delivery plunged on Wednesday on the back of forecasts indicating a sharp increase in electricity production from wind turbines. The benchmark German baseload power price for Thursday delivery dipped more than 36% or 10.58 euros to 18.03 euros/MWh. The French prompt electricity price for Thursday was down 4.4 percent, or 2.3 euros to 49.65 euros/MWh, retreating from a seven-month high hit the previous day.

Along the forward electricity curve, Germany's Cal'18, the European year-ahead benchmark, rose slightly by 1.2 percent to 35.31 euros/MWh, following gains in fuels. The French contract for 2018 delivery traded 0.8% higher at 41.90 euros/MWh.
 
EU carbon futures tumbled at their lowest level in almost two weeks, despite surges across the rest of the European energy complex. December 2018 expiry EU carbon permits slumped by 1.4% to 6.93 euros a tonne.
