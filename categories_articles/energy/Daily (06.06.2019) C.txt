Moreover, the outlook of a slowing global oil demand maintained by the ongoing U.S. trade differences with China and Mexico also weighed on prices. As a result, WTI futures dropped by 3.4% to $51.68 a barrel, while Brent crude lost 2.2% to close at $60.63 a barrel.UK gas prices fell back on Wednesday, as the unabated bearish fundamentals led to a correction after the previous day rise. Consequently, NBP spot traded 3.1% lower at 28.58 p/therm. On the curve, the contract for delivery in March 2020 retreated by 0.6% to 52.71 p/therm.
 
European day-ahead power prices extended losses on Wednesday. Forecasts for stronger wind power output sent the German spot power contract down to 36.48 EUR/MWh, or a 3.8% drop. At the same time, the price for the equivalent French contract sank by 4.5% to 33.53 EUR/MWh, amid higher nuclear availability and falling consumption.
 
Further on the curve, electricity prices continued to climb, despite the downward evolution in the energy complex. The price for the German power contract for delivery in 2020 increased by 1.2% to 47.43 EUR/MWh. The equivalent French contract registered the same gain, ending at 50.32 EUR/MWh.
 
EU carbon prices turned bearish on Wednesday, as the influence from a weaker energy complex offset the firming EUA demand. The 2021-expiry contract traded 1.2% lower at 24.86 EUR/tonne.
