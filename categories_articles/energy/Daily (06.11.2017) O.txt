DailyOil prices jumped on Friday, reinforcing after U.S. rig data suggested drilling in the United States would diminish. Global benchmark Brent futures ended $1.45, or 2.4 percent, higher at $62.07 a barrel. Brent rose almost 38 percent since its low in June 2017.  Meanwhile, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude closed $1.10, or 2%, up at $55.64 a barrel. Both contracts hit the highest level since July 2015, posting gains of more than 3 percent for the week.
 
British wholesale gas prices fell on Friday due to strong imports from Norway which contributed to an oversupplied system. Even though the day-ahead gas price edged slightly higher to 49.45 p/therm, gas contracts along the forward curve settled down.  The price for delivery in December 2017 slumped by 2% to 50.89 p/therm.
 
European spot electricity prices surged on Friday supported by forecasts showing a sharp decline in temperatures which will buyout power demand mainly in France. The French baseload spot power price for Monday delivery soared 6 percent to hit 60.63 euros/MWh, compared with the price paid for Friday delivery. The German prompt contract for Monday delivery also extended gains to settle at 51.02 euros/MWh.

Further along the power curve, year-ahead contracts tumbled alongside coal prices. The German baseload power for delivery in 2018 slumped by 1.34 percent to 36.70 euros/MWh. The equivalent French contract dropped by 1.1 percent to 41.64 euros/MWh.

EU carbon prices shrugged off a rarely failed auction and lower electricity prices on Friday to soar for the fourth day in a row, posting a 10% weekly gain as traders positioned ahead of this week's ETS reform discussions. The carbon contract expiring in 2018 settled 2.9% up at 7.92 euros a tonne.
