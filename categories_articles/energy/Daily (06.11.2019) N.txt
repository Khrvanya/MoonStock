Hence, Brent crude rose by 1.3% to $62.96 a barrel. In the meantime, WTI futures ended 1.2% up at $57.23 a barrel.UK wholesale gas prices remained bullish on Tuesday, as colder weather boosted gas-for-heating demand. Moreover, low wind generation lifted demand from gas-fired plants. In addition, an outage at UK Barrow gas terminal and falling output from the Culzean gas field ahead of a five-day maintenance starting at the weekend lent more support to the NBP spot price, which added 9% to close at 34.60 p/therm. On the curve, the contract for delivery in March 2020 gained 1.6% to trade at 45.93 p/therm.
