DailyCrude oil prices increased on Wednesday, after EIA report showed that U.S. gasoline stocks plunged more than expected last week, offsetting the surging crude inventories. OPEC's oil production at four-year low in March coupled with U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela lent more support to prices. Brent crude price rose by 1.6% to $71.73 a barrel, while WTI futures traded 1% up at $64.61 a barrel.British wholesale gas prices reversed the strong earlier gains on Wednesday, ahead of five LNG cargoes to arrive in Britain by April 20. The NBP spot price slumped by 4.3% to 40.40 p/therm. In the meantime, the contract price for delivery in August 2019 tumbled by 4.6% to 41.58 p/therm. 
 
The European day-ahead electricity prices continued to climb on Wednesday, due to cold weather forecasts and consequently firmer demand. The German spot power price surged by 4.5% to 44.74 EUR/MWh, supported by a drop in wind generation. Meanwhile, the equivalent French contract traded at the same price as the German one, posting a 1.5% hike, amid lower nuclear availability and reduced hydropower supply due to a 24-hour strike.
 
Along the forward curve, power prices added ground on Wednesday, bolstered by hiking carbon prices. The German power contract for delivery in 2020 ended 3.9% higher at 51.34 EUR/MWh. The equivalent French contract price jumped by 3.7% to close at 54.44 EUR/MWh.
