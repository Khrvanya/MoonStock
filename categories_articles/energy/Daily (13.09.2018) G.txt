DailyOil crude prices continued to gain ground on Wednesday, because of dwindling U.S. stocks. Another reason is that concerns about global oil supply have increased amid looming sanctions on Iranian exports. Brent crude closed 0.9% up at $79.74 a barrel, while WTI crude price soared by 1.6% to $70.37 a barrel.Stronger flows from Langeled pipeline contributed to an oversupplied system, and thus, weighed down on British wholesale gas prices. Accordingly, NBP spot price tumbled by 3.1% to 72.90 p/therm. On the forward curve, Q4 2018 delivery contract closed 4% lower at 76.32 p/therm.
 
Strong demand and forecasts for lower wind generation buoyed European spot power prices on Wednesday. Accordingly, the German day-ahead contract price ended 12.1% higher at 71.52 euros/MWh. The French equivalent contract added only 4.1% to 71.10 euros/MWh, as gains were capped by increased nuclear availability, after the restart of three nuclear reactors.
 
Meanwhile, electricity prices on the forward curve fell, tracking bearish coal and carbon markets. The German Cal' 19 baseload electricity price decreased by 1.4% to close at 56.11 euros/MWh. The French equivalent contract for 2019 delivery ended 1.2% lower at 61.85 euros/MWh.
 
European carbon contracts lost momentum in a weaker auction on Wednesday, following the downward evolution in the energy prices. The carbon contract expiring in 2021 traded around 4.8% lower at 24.47 euros a tonne.
