DailyOil prices slumped for a second consecutive day on Wednesday, as a decline in U.S. crude stockpiles was counterbalanced by a larger-than-forecast increase in gasoline inventories and as U.S. crude production continued to grow to record peaks. Brent crude ended down 1.4 percent, or 90 cents, at $62.44 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude settled down 54 cents at $56.60 a barrel, a 1 percent decline. British wholesale gas prices dropped on Wednesday as supply concerns eased after Austria's Baumgarten gas hub reopened following a blast on Tuesday. NBP day-ahead gas price decreased by 19.25 pence, or 22.4%, to 66.75 p/therm. Along the forward curve, Q1 2018 contract was down 7.8% at 58.93 p/therm.
 
Europe's wholesale electricity market appeared calm on Wednesday. Day-ahead baseload power in France dropped by 18% to 58.29 euros/MWh, as temperatures were due to increase by one degree Celsius and demand likely to decline. The equivalent German contract jumped 15% to 31.01 euros/MWh from extremely low levels as voluminous all-day wind power supply was forecast to change to selective bursts intraday, leaving some peak times uncovered.

Along the forward prices curve, contracts were off Tuesday's peaks as related fuels such as coal and carbon came in steady to lower. German 2018 delivery baseload power contract, the European benchmark, lost 0.3% to 37.95 euros. The less liquid French year-ahead power lost 0.9% to 43.80 euros/MWh.

EU carbon prices tumbled to their lowest levels since October 10 on Wednesday after a breach of a major technical support level and amid a calmer energy complex. The carbon contract expiring in 2018 settled 0.8% lower at 7.11 euros a tonne.
