DailyOil crude prices were strongly bearish on Thursday on concerns over global oversupply and following another hike in U.S. interest rates, which weighed down on stock markets. The price for Brent tumbled by 5.1% to $54.35 a barrel, or a 15-month low. WTI crude was 4.8% down at $45.88 a barrel. 
Mixed evolution in British gas prices was noticed on Thursday, in a rather balanced system. NBP spot price soared by 1.5% to close at 66.75 p/therm, due to reduced LNG supplies, while flows from Norway were decreased due to outages.
 
However, expectations for additional vessels within final weeks of 2018, put some pressure on several contracts on the curve. Accordingly, the Winter 2019 delivery contract price edged 0.1% lower at 66.76 p/therm.
 
Forecasts on high volumes of German wind power supply and weaker electricity demand weighed on power prices on Thursday. German base spot price slumped by 12.5% to 49.62 EUR/MWh, while the French equivalent contract settled 9.3% down at 53.96 EUR/MWh.
 
Further along the power curve, prices followed the downward trend in related coal and oil markets. The German Cal'19 contract closed 1.5% down at 55.48 EUR/MWh, while the French 2019-delivery contract ended 1.4% lower at 61.02 EUR/MWh. 
 
A fluctuating session ended with a slight decline in carbon prices on Thursday. The price for the contract expiring in 2021 edged 0.5% lower at 25.78 euros a tonne.
