A record crude oil refinery throughput in 2018 reported by China's National Bureau of Statistics supported the prices. However, a slowing economy and tensions between US and China limited gains. Brent crude edged 0.1% higher at $62.74 a barrel, while WTI futures rose by 0.7% to $54.17 a barrel.British gas prices were down on Monday as strong flows from Norway and Belgium left the system oversupplied.
