DailyBrent crude dropped by 2.3% to $73.05 a barrel on Thursday, right before the OPEC meeting which is aimed at raising oil output. The news about a higher-than-expected stockpile draw in the U.S. put pressure on WTI crude price, which settled 0.3% lower at $65.54 a barrel. 
 
British gas contracts along the forward curve recovered on Thursday, because of the unplanned outage at Kollsnes and the FLAGs pipeline system into St Fergus, Scotland. The Winter 2018 delivery contract gained 0.5% to close at 61.85 p/therm. Still, an oversupplied system weighed down on the day-ahead gas price, which fell 1.1% to 52.2 p/therm.
 
Lower demand due to approaching holidays, higher wind generation in Germany and a 10-days strike announced by French production workers contributed to a significant decline in European power prices on Thursday. Both German and French electricity contracts for day-ahead delivery have been strongly affected, slumping by 31.5% to settle at 20.73 EUR/MWh and by 22.2% to close at 36.74 EUR/MWh respectively.
 
On the power curve, prices followed the bearish evolution in related coal and oil markets. The German Cal'19 contract was 0.7% down at 40.94 EUR/MWh, while the French equivalent contract ended 0.8% lower at 45.75 EUR/MWh
 
EU carbon prices extended their upward trend on Thursday, settling 5% higher from their intraday low, as Wednesday's options expiry are most likely not to cause an important sell-off. The 2021 delivery contract closed 2.2% higher at 15.04 euros a tonne.
