DailyOil prices were seen recovering on Wednesday, after U.S. government data indicated stronger demand for refined fuels. Nevertheless, concerns over increasing global crude supply are persisting. Brent crude ended 95 cents, or 1.5%, higher at $63.48 per barrel, after having dropped to an almost 1-year low in the previous session. In the meantime, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude jumped by $1.20, or 2.3 percent higher, at $54.63, after hitting its lowest price level since October 2017 a day before.
 
British wholesale gas prices varied on Wednesday in a rather balanced system, as high send-out rates from liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals counterweighed robust demand because of lower temperatures and reduced wind generation. NBP day-ahead gas price soared by 1% to 66.50 p/therm. Further along the curve, the contract for delivery in 2019 settled 0.4% down at 60.33 p/therm.
 
A mixed trend was noticed in European spot electricity prices for day-ahead delivery on Wednesday. The German position was lifted by a decline in wind power generation, with the baseload power price for Thursday delivery hiking by 40.5% to 77.80 euros/MWh. Meanwhile, the French spot price retreated from its previous day peak, on forecasts for higher temperatures during the weekend. The French price for Thursday delivery slumped by 11.2% to 102.22 euros/MWh.
 
Year-ahead power contracts posted gains, tracking the bullish evolution in carbon emissions prices. The German baseload electricity price for 2019 delivery surged by 1.5% to 52.05 euros/MWh. The equivalent French contract traded 1.5% higher at 56.90 euros/MWh.
 
EU carbon prices gained ground on Wednesday, exceeding the EUR20-level in a strong auction. European December 2019 expiry CO2 allowances closed 5.2 percent higher at 20.87 euros a tonne.
