DailyOil ended higher on Monday after dollar variations and the restart of some Libyan oil fields caused the market to vacillate, with prices testing lower before rising to levels just below three-year peaks. Brent crude futures for March delivery settled 42 cents, or 0.6 percent, up at $69.03 a barrel, after earlier surging to $69.51. Brent on January 15 had hit $70.37, the highest level since December 2014. U.S. crude increased by 40 cents, or 0.3 percent, to end at $63.57 a barrel.
 
Most of the wholesale gas prices in the UK rose on Monday due to reduced flows through the Vesterled pipeline from Norway and an unscheduled outage at Heimdal gas field. The NBP day-ahead gas price slightly increased to 49.30 p/therm. The biggest surge was registered by February 2018 delivery contract, closing 2.4% higher at 51.35 p/therm.
 
European wholesale power prices for next day delivery soared on Monday, because of bullish weather and demand patterns that overrode comfortable thermal supply in mid-winter. German baseload for Tuesday delivery, at 37.28 euros/MWh, was up 3.9 percent from Monday's over-the-counter settlement price. The equivalent French contract, at 38.37 euros, was up 4.1 percent.

Along the forward power curve, Germany's Cal '19 baseload contract, the European benchmark, edged 12 cents, or 0.3$, up at 35.67 euros/MWh. The equivalent French contract was at 40.55 euros/MWh, up 20 cents from its close.

EU carbon prices prolonged last week's five-year high early on Monday, but soon retreated after the day's auction cleared at an all-time peak but with very weak indicators. The carbon emission allowances were flat at the end of the trading day.
