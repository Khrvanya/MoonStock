DailyA downward trend was noticed in the oil markets on Tuesday, as persistent worries over Chinas' economic slowdown and its potential negative impact on oil demand weighed on prices. IMF's warning about increased risk of slowing global growth in the context of U.S.-China trade dispute put more pressure on prices. Consequently, Brent crude lost nearly 2% to settle at $61.50 a barrel. At the same time, WTI futures declined by 2.1% to $53.01 a barrel.UK gas prices were mixed on Tuesday. NBP spot edged slightly higher at 58.50 p/therm in view of forecasts for lower temperatures and weaker wind generation boosting gas-for-power demand. However, strong gas supplies limited gains. On the curve, gas prices were slightly bearish due to an oversupplied system. The NBP year-ahead contract traded 0.8% down at 55.75 p/therm.
 
European electricity prices had an upward evolution on Tuesday, supported by an expected decrease in wind and solar power generation in Germany. The German spot power contract surged by 19.2% to 75.08 p/therm, as lower temperatures forecasts lifted demand. The equivalent French contract jumped by 5.2% to 76.07 p/therm, amid steady nuclear availability after a strike had curbed production at utility EDF's 1,300 megawatt (MW) St. Alban 1 nuclear reactor by around 80% a day before.
 
On the forward curve, electricity prices were driven up by higher prices in carbon, coal and gas markets. The German year-ahead contract rose by 2.5% to 51.67 EUR/MWh, while the equivalent French contract gained 2.3% to close at 55.15 EUR/MWh.
 
Technical buying and supply cuts lent support to European carbon prices on Tuesday. The 2020-expiry contract spiked by nearly 3% to 25.65 euros a tonne.
