DailyOil prices continued their upward trend on Tuesday, as sanction waivers on Iranian oil imports will stop on May 1. However, U.S. officials consider that increasing U.S. crude production along with supplies from supportive Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates are enough to cover global demand. As a result, Brent crude traded 0.6% higher at $74.51 a barrel, while WTI futures rose by 1.1% to $66.30 a barrel. Most of the UK forward gas prices turned bullish on Tuesday, stimulated by a stronger energy complex. The contract for delivery in December 2019 traded 1.2% higher at 60.71 p/therm. On the other side, the day-ahead NBP price ended at 27 p/therm, plummeting by 23% compared to the last trading session on Thursday, weighed by increased storage injections due to a planned shutdown at IUK pipeline, warmer weather and abundant LNG flows.
 
The European spot power prices skyrocketed on Tuesday, as demand recovered after the recent fall during Easter holidays. The price for the German spot power contract soared by 135.3% to 34.70 EUR/MWh. Meanwhile, the equivalent French contract price spiked by 23.9% to 33.39 EUR/MWh.
 
Along the curve, no trading activity was noticed in the electricity forward contracts following the Easter holidays period. 
 
EU carbon prices resumed their upward evolution on Tuesday, heading for a 11-year high, tracking gains on oil markets. The price for the 2020-expiry contract hiked by 2.4% to 27.83 EUR/tonne.
