Meanwhile, weaker demand forecasts and the full restart of Libya's largest oil field reduced gains. Against that backdrop, Brent crude traded 0.9% higher at $63.83 a barrel, while WTI futures closed 1% up, at $56.77 a barrel. UK gas prices rose on Tuesday, amid weaker Norwegian flows. Moreover, higher power consumption for cooling purposes due to the heatwave boosted demand from gas-fired power plants. NBP spot jumped by 6.9% % to 29.40 p/therm. The contract for delivery in Winter 2019 gained 1.2%, ending at 52.82 p/therm.
