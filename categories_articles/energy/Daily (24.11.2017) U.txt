DailyOil prices hit a two-year peak on Thursday as the shutdown of a major crude pipeline from Canada and a draw on fuel inventories pointed to a tightening market, despite increasing production from U.S. producers. Brent crude settled 23 cents, or 0.4%, higher at $63.55 per barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 53 cents, or 0.9%, at $58.55 per barrelBritish wholesale gas prices surged on Thursday as colder weather forecasts boosted demand.  NBP day-ahead gas price soared by 1.55 pence, or 2.9%, to close at 54.50 p/therm. Along the forward curve, gas contract for 2018 summer delivery traded 0.50 pence, or 1.1%, up at 45.40 p/therm. 

 
European spot electricity prices increased sharply on Thursday as falling temperatures in the region encouraged demand, while wind power generation tumbled, and France reported a delay to the relaunch of a nuclear reactor in an already tight supply situation. German day-ahead baseload traded at 42.73 euros/MWh, up 83% day on day, while the equivalent French price was up 5.6% at 57.21 euros.

Prices on the year-ahead power curve rose after a weaker start, following gains in coal and carbon as well as those on the UK gas curve. Germany's electricity contract for delivery in 2018 was up 0.6% at 36.21 euros/MWh, and the same French contract added 1% to 42.17 euros/MWh.

EU carbon prices added almost 4% on Thursday after robust demand signals from the day's auction supported what appeared to be speculative purchasing and some short-covering. Emission allowances expiring in 2020 ended at 7.87 euros a tonne.
