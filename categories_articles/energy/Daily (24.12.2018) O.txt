DailyOn Friday, oil crude prices extended losses, as traders were concerned about global oversupply, staying away from the market ahead of winter holidays. The price for Brent decreased by 1% to $53.82 a barrel, to hit new lows since September 2017. WTI crude traded 0.6% down at $45.59 a barrel.The gas system was quite balanced, with mixed prices for UK gas contracts on Friday. An oversupplied system following the restart of the Norwegian flows after maintenance led to a 0.5% decline in the NBP spot to 66.4 p/therm.
 
On the curve, gas prices were slightly bullish as demand for heating is expected to strengthen on colder weather forecasts. The January 2019 delivery contract price surged by 0.6% to 69.05 p/therm.
 
European power prices slumped on Friday, due to lower demand ahead of Christmas holidays. Despite reduced wind generation, German day-ahead price tumbled by 26.2% to 36.62 EUR/MWh. Meanwhile, the French equivalent contract fell 17.4% to 44.58 EUR/MWh, due to increased nuclear availability after the relaunch of EDF's Dampierre 4 nuclear reactor.
 
Further along the curve, the upward trend in related coal and carbon markets lent some support to electricity prices. The German Cal'19 contract closed 0.6% higher to 55.8 EUR/MWh, while the French 2019-delivery contract ended 0.9% down at 61.55 EUR/MWh.
 
European carbon contracts gained ground to settle above EUR25 level in a late session on Friday. The price for the contract expiring in 2020 rose by 1.8% to end at 25.52 euros a tonne.
