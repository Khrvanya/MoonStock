DailyThursday saw a mixed evolution in oil prices. Continuous concerns over global economic slowdown and the unexpected rise in U.S. crude inventories weighed slightly on Brent spot, which ended down at $61.09 a barrel. However, WTI futures rose by 1% to $53.13 a barrel, supported by OPEC-led output cuts and U.S. threats to impose sanctions on OPEC member Venezuela.British gas prices fell on Thursday, as short-term forecasts for rising temperatures curbed gas-for-heating consumption. In addition, stronger wind output reduced the demand from gas-fired power stations. Consequently, NBP spot dipped by 5.5% to 56.35 p/therm, while the NBP for delivery in February declined by 4.4% to 57.57 p/therm.

European electricity prices plunged on Thursday on lower demand due to stronger wind generation and milder weather expected in the coming days. The German spot power price plummeted by 22.5% to 66.50 p/therm. The equivalent French contract traded 19.1% down at 69.53 p/therm, as increased nuclear availability put more pressure on prices.
 
On the curve, electricity forward prices lost ground, following bearish carbon and fuels markets. The German power contract for delivery in 2020 ended 1.3% down at 51.12 p/therm. A 1.3% loss was also noticed in the equivalent French contract, which closed at 54.34 p/therm.
 
Traders' worries about a weaker energy complex led to a further decline in European carbon prices on Thursday, after hitting earlier peaks in bullish auctions since the beginning of the year. The 2019-expiry contract price ended 2.6% lower at 24.07 euros a tonne.
