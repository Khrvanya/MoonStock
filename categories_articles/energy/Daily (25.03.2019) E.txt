DailyWeaker oil demand, the unhurried U.S.-China trade talks and last week's dismal German and U.S. manufacturing data which revived concerns over a sluggish global economic growth weighed on oil prices on Friday. A stronger dollar put more pressure on prices. Brent crude traded 1.2% down at 67.03 USD/bbl, while WTI futures dropped by 1.6 % to 59.04 USD/bbl. British gas prices decreased on Friday due to ample supply. Moreover, seven LNG cargoes are expected in the next two weeks. The Q2 2019-delivery contract slumped by 2.9% to 35.55 p/therm. Meanwhile, the NBP spot price edged 0.5% lower at 36.65 p/therm, as losses were capped by forecasts for cooler weather next week.
 
Short-term forecasts for rising wind output and consequently reduced consumption led to a fall in the European day-ahead power prices on Friday. The German spot power price plunged by 12.2% to 35.61 EUR/MWh. The equivalent French contract price tumbled by 12% to 35.60 EUR/MWh, ahead of the planned restart of five reactors on Sunday. 
 
Along the forward curve, electricity prices retreated, amid a bearish energy complex. The price for the German power contract for delivery in 2020 was 0.8% down at 45.52 EUR/MWh. The same decline was noticed in the equivalent French contract, which ended at 48.92 EUR/MWh.
 
European carbon prices extended losses on Friday, hitting a new 3-week low, influenced by the downward evolution in gas prices and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty. The contract expiring in 2020 settled 1.3% down at 21 EUR/tonne.
