DailyOil prices prolonged gains on Monday, with Brent crude hitting a 26-month peak, supported by Turkey's menace to reduce crude flows from Iraq's Kurdistan area to the outside world. London Brent crude for November delivery was $2.16, or .38%, up at $59.02 a barrel, the highest level since July 10, 2015. U.S. crude traded $1.56, or 3.1%, higher at $52.22, or a five-month high.
 
Cooler weather forecasts and a slightly undersupplied gas network helped to spur gains on prompt and front-month gas contracts at the UK's National Balancing Point gas trading hub on Monday. Day-ahead gas price hiked by 3 pence, or 6.8%, to close at 46.95 p/therm. Meanwhile, the October gas contract settled 5.5% up at 46.16 pence per therm.
 
European day-ahead electricity prices diverged on Monday as higher renewables production weighed on the German contract, while a forecast increase in demand and fall in nuclear output boosted French prices. The French baseload spot electricity contract for Tuesday delivery rose 4.4% to 46.19 euros per MWh. On the other side, the German equivalent contract slipped by 4.5% to 40.44 euros/MWh.

In the forward power curve, prices surged suddenly, following gains in coal and carbon emission prices, while the prospect of the Germany's Green party becoming a powerbroker after Sunday's election, provided support to the 2019 and 2020 contract. The European benchmark German Cal '18 contract posted strong gains, rising around 3% to 36.25 euros/MWh, close to a recent 3-1/2 year high. The same French contract closed 2.3% higher at 42.05 euros/MWh.

European carbon prices jumped around 10% on huge volume of over 85 million tonnes traded on Monday, as bullish sentiment from yesterday's German auction result and comments from significant oil producers supported the entire energy complex. EU carbon contract expiring in 2018 ended up at 7.31 euros a tonne.
