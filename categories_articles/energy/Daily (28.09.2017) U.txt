DailyBrent prices slumped on Wednesday, while U.S. crude rallied, after oil stockpiles in the world's major consumer unpredictably drew down with refiners coming back online following Hurricane Harvey last month. Brent crude slipped from 26-month peaks to close 54 cents, or around 1 percent, down at $57.90 a barrel. Meanwhile, WTI crude ended 26 cents, or 0.5 percent, higher at $52.14, but remained below five-month peaks. The market was hurt by a stronger dollar, which often moves in the opposite direction of oil prices.
 
Wholesale gas prices rose on Wednesday, because of lower Norwegian flows and a largely balanced system amid predictions for warm weather and strong winds. NBP day-ahead gas increased slightly to 46.15 pence per therm. Meanwhile, the November gas contract gained 0.21 pence, or 0.5%, arriving at 48.76 pence per therm.
 
European electricity prices for day-ahead delivery were mixed on Wednesday, with France's rising on forecasts for lower renewables production, while German prices eased along with reduced consumption. The baseload German contract for Thursday delivery dropped by 1.4 percent to 40.3 euros/MWh. The French spot contract for the day ahead rose 4.1 percent to 47.07 euros/MWh.

Along the forward power curve, the European benchmark German Cal '18 contract settled 0.2 percent down to 35.90 euros/MWh. The less-liquid French year-ahead contract, which trades at a big premium to its German counterpart, edged slightly higher at 41.59 euros/MWh.
 
European carbon prices dropped on Wednesday in a range-bound trade that contrasted with the preceding two volatile sessions. December 2018 expiry EU carbon permits fell 0.7 percent to 6.96 euros a tonne.
