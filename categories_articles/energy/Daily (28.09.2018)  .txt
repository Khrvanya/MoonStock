DailyOil crude prices rose on Thursday, supported by forecasts for a decline in global supply once U.S. sanctions against Iran will become effective in just five weeks. Moreover, the OPEC and Russia seem unlikely to comply with Trump's demands to rise production. Brent crude gained 0.5% trading at $81.72 a barrel. WTI crude was up by 0.8% at $72.12 a barrel. British wholesale gas prices fell on Thursday due to weaker exports to continental Europe, storage injections and lower demand, which contributed to an oversupplied system. Accordingly, NBP spot price lost 2.9% to end at 72.75 p/therm. Along the forward curve, October 2018 delivery contract traded 3.3% lower at 72.63 p/therm.
 
European spot power prices were bearish on Thursday. The German baseload electricity contract lost 3.6% to trade at 51.97 EUR/MWh, due to higher wind generation and reduced demand. Meanwhile, the French equivalent contract shed by 4.2% to 61.72 EUR/MWh, due to the same reasons.
 
 On the curve, electricity prices had a mixed trend on Thursday. The German Cal'19 European benchmark price increased by 0.5% to close at 53.95 EUR/MWh, tracking bullish carbon markets. The French electricity contract for 2019 delivery ended 1.3% down at 53.95 EUR/MWh, due to losses in coal market.
 
EU carbon contracts rose above EUR21 on Thursday, as a stronger session helped recouping losses from the previous two auctions. The 2021-expiry contract price surged by 2.8% to 23.04 euros a tonne.
