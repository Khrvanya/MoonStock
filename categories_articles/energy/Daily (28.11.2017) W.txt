DailyOil prices fell on Monday, decreasing from two-year peaks on the prospect of higher U.S. production, although global markets were slightly better buyout by predictions that an OPEC-led supply cut would be extended. Brent crude futures were almost unchanged from their last close, settling at $63.84 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $58.11 a barrel, down 84 cents, or 1.4 percent, from their last settlement. British wholesale gas prices soared on Monday despite an oversupplied market on anticipations of colder weather and forecasts for a stronger demand as a third of the country's nuclear plants are offline. NBP day-ahead gas price rose 0.40 pence, or 0.7%, to 57.40 p/therm. Further along the curve, prices also increased, with December 2017 contract up 0.4% at 57.96 p/therm. 
 
German and French spot electricity prices for day-ahead delivery surged on Monday as a forecast decline in wind electricity generation boosted the German contract, and despite improving nuclear power availability in France. The German baseload electricity price for Tuesday delivery was up by 8.21 euros, or over 28 percent at 37.42 euros/MWh, compared with the price paid for Monday delivery. The French spot price for Tuesday delivery slightly rose 2.17 euros to 65.53 euros/MWh.

Along the year-ahead power curve Germany's power contract was up 0.4 percent at 36.93 euros/MWh, while the equivalent French contract added 0.4 percent to 42.84 euros.

European carbon dipped on Monday after matching the two-week peak of the prior session, though observers predicted that little could weigh on prices this week. Carbon contract expiring in 2018 ended 0.8% at 7.73 euros a tonne.
