DailyOil prices turned bearish again on Thursday, due to forecasts for weaker global economic growth and record production of crude, which weighed down on the market. Brent crude slumped by 4.2% to $52.16 a barrel. At the same time, the rise in U.S. stocks contributed to a 3.5% decline in WTI crude to $44.61 a barrel.
An oversupplied system due to expectations for higher temperatures and lower demand led to a significant reduction in British gas prices. Accordingly, NBP spot price plunged by 7.8% to 61.8 p/therm. On the curve, the 2019 delivery contract traded 2.4% down at 59.26 p/therm.
 
On Thursday, European prompt power prices edged slightly lower, on stronger wind and nuclear generation. German electricity baseload price for Friday delivery was at 59.8 euros/MWh, or around 0.4% down. Meanwhile, the price for the French equivalent contract fell by 1.1% to 60.84 euros/MWh. 
 
Prices for EUAs lost momentum in a highly volatile session on Thursday. The carbon contract expiring in 2021 traded 0.7% down at 26.32 euros a tonne.
