DailyCrude oil prices edged up on Friday, backed by stronger consumer spending in the U.S. and heightened concerns about safety of oil transport around the Strait of Hormuz. Lower U.S. crude stocks lent more support to prices. However, gains were limited by fears that oil demand would decline due to slower global economic growth. Against that backdrop, Brent crude advanced by only 0.1% to $63.46 a barrel, while WTI futures rose by 0.3% to $56.20 a barrel. Flows from Norway restarted via the Langeled pipeline, dragging down the British wholesale gas prices on Friday. Weaker demand for gas-fired generation due to the receding heatwave also weighed on prices. Hence, the NBP spot price dropped by 1.4% to 27.50 p/therm. The contract for delivery in Winter 2019 lost 1.3% to settle at 50.32 p/therm.
 
The European day-ahead power prices fell sharply on Friday, amid expectations for temperatures cooling off from heat wave conditions and due to the prospect of a reduced consumption. The price for the German day-ahead power contract slumped by 18.7% to 36.16 EUR/MWh. At the same time, the price for the equivalent French contract plummeted by 22.5% to 36.26 EUR/MWh. 
 
Along the curve, electricity prices continued their slide, influenced by cheaper carbon emissions and the bearish evolution in the gas and coal markets. The German power contract for delivery in 2020 traded 1.7% lower at 51.72 EUR/MWh, while the equivalent French contract lost 1.5% to end at 53.49 EUR/MWh. 
 
EU carbon prices extended losses into a third straight auction on Friday, due to forecasts for cooler temperatures and a decline in gas and coal prices. Consequently, the 2020-expiry contract tumbled by 2.5% to 28.66 EUR/tonne.
