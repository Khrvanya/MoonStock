DailyCrude oil prices inched up on Monday, amid expectations that U.S. Federal Reserve might lower the borrowing costs this week for the first time in over a decade. Ongoing supply concerns around the Strait of Hormuz also supported prices. Still, on demand side, reduced hopes for a trade deal between the U.S. and China before the 2020 U.S. election, limited gains. As a result, Brent crude traded 0.4% higher at $63.71 a barrel, while WTI futures climbed by 1.2% to $56.87 a barrel.British wholesale gas prices were mixed on Monday. The NBP spot price tumbled by 2.4% to 26.83 p/therm, due to increased flows from Norway's small fields. Moreover, forecasts for stronger wind power output diminished the gas-for-power demand. On the curve, the contract price for delivery in June 2020 rose by 1%, ending at 44.74 p/therm, in anticipation of the upcoming extensive maintenance at the UK Continental Shelf in August.
 
The European day-ahead power prices diverged on Monday. Forecasts for weaker output from wind turbines and firming consumption led to a 23.2% surge in the German spot power contract, which closed at 44.53 EUR/MWh. On the other side, the price for the equivalent French contract continued its fall, plunging by 11.8% to 31.97 EUR/MWh, due to an expected rise in wind generation. The price was also weighed by returning nuclear availability following the restart of several nuclear reactors after the current heatwave subsided.
 
Forward electricity prices varied. The German power contract for delivery in 2020 reversed course to edge up by 0.3% at 51.85 EUR/MWh, tracking the bullish movements on the carbon market. Meanwhile, the price for the equivalent French contract decreased by 0.4% to 53.30 EUR/MWh, influenced by lower coal prices and losses in several gas contracts. 
 
EU carbon prices strengthened on Monday, as traders focused on the prospect of a tighter supply in August. The contract expiring in 2019 advanced by 0.5% to 28.42 EUR/tonne, with gains being capped by bearish indicators and growing fears of a no-deal Brexit.
