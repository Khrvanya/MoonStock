DailyBrent oil price rose on predictions that OPEC-led output reductions would be prolonged beyond March even though higher Iraqi exports put a cap on prices. Brent crude futures increased by 46 cents, or 0.8 percent, to settle at $60.90 per barrel, its highest level since July 2015. Meanwhile, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures surged 0.5% to $54.15 a barrel.British prompt gas prices soared on Monday because of higher consumption and an undersupplied market. The day-ahead gas price jumped by 2.2% to 47.10 p/therm.  Nevertheless, most curve prices traded slightly down. The November 2017 delivery contract ended 0.5% lower at 47.60 p/therm.
 
European spot power prices for day-ahead delivery diverged on Monday as expectations for a sharp drop in wind and solar electricity generation offered support in Germany despite power consumption seen decreasing due to holidays. The German baseload spot power price for Tuesday delivery gained 5 euros to 36.96 euros/MWh. The French equivalent contract added 5 euros to close at 56.92 euros/MWh.
 
Along the forward electricity curve, the German baseload power for 2018 delivery rose 0.2 percent to 36.63 euros/MWh, tracking gains in carbon emissions and fuels. The equivalent French power contract traded 0.9% lower at 41.88 euros/MWh.

EUAs continued their decline on Monday as observers saw little on the short-term horizon to considerably influence prices, despite less worries about the UK's post-Brexit future in the ETS, bullish signs coming from the German dark spreads and lower temperatures setting in across Europe. December 2018 expiry EU carbon permits were 0.3 percent lower at 7.18 euros a tonne.
