DailyA stronger dollar and a potential decision of the OPEC and its allies to increase production weighed on Brent crude on Thursday, which settled 80 cents, or about 1% lower at $75.94 a barrel. Meanwhile, WTI crude soared by 0.4% to end at $66.89 a barrel, in a catchup process to the higher priced products and Brent values. Most of the British gas prices fell on Thursday due to an oversupplied system, increased wind generation and the expected arrival of a new LNG vessel on Sunday. The July 2018 delivery contract traded 0.7% lower at 56.45 p/therm. On the other hand, the day-ahead gas price edged 0.4% up at 56.1 p/therm, as IUK is still in maintenance.
 
Expectations for a decline in renewables electricity generation boosted European spot power prices for day-ahead delivery. The spot electricity price in Germany gained 13.3% at 49.45 EUR/MWh, while the French equivalent contract added 10.1% to end at 50.57 EUR/MWh. 
 
Contracts along the forward curve rose along with the day-ahead delivery prices, despite a bearish energy complex. German Cal'19 delivery contract traded 0.6% higher on Thursday to close at 42.54, while the French equivalent contract ended 0.4% up at 46.85 EUR/MWh for French.
 
On Thursday, carbon prices slumped again in the direction of the EUR15 level due to late selling, despite the bullish auction result. The carbon contracts expiring in 2019 and 2021 closed 2.6% down at 15.14 and 15.98 euros a tonne, respectively.
