RenewableAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), Denmark is on the road to reach its ambitious objective of turning into a low carbon economy, or independent of fossil fuels, by 2050 year.The country is also moving forward towards its 2030 goal to generate at least half of the nation's total energy consumption through renewables. The IEA says the share of renewable energy in the country's electricity mix is currently estimated at around 45%. It declares that Denmark has the highest share of wind power in electricity generation out of all IEA countries.

The group recommends finding out a solution on how the country will quickly decarbonize the heating sector. Denmark already uses combined heat and power (CHP) plants to supply 50% of the electricity and around 67% of the heat sold in the country and is smoothly shifting from coal, natural gas and oil in heating systems to more sustainable power generation sources like biomass.

Paul Simons, the IEA Deputy Executive Director, said: "Denmark is now widely recognized as a global leader in integrating variable renewable energy while at the same time maintaining a highly reliable and secure electricity system, thanks to a flexible domestic power system and a high level of cross-border connections."
