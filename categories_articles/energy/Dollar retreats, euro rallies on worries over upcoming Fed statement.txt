  The U.S. dollar fell against most major currencies on Monday on concerns that the  Federal Reserve could suggest in an upcoming policy statement that  the greenback's gains had gone too far, while a rally in oil  prices boosted commodity-linked currencies.The U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday for the first time this year and only  the second time since the global financial crisis.With a hike largely priced in, focus has turned to what signal the Fed will send on further policy tightening next  year and the dollar's nearly four percent rally against a basket  of major currencies through Friday in the wake of Republican  Donald Trump's U.S. election victory on Nov. 8.  Most of those gains have come about as a result of U.S. Treasury yields shooting higher on expectations that Trump  will enact policies that increase spending and debt as well as  spur growth and inflation."A percentage of the market is worried about what the Fed could say that could potentially halt the current dollar strength that we're seeing," said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto.The euro rose as much as 0.7 percent against the dollar to  a session high of $1.0625 after falling to a one-week low of $1.0526 in early trading.

"That helps emerging market currencies and commonwealth currencies."
