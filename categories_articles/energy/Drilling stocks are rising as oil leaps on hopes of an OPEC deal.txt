  Energy stocks led U.S. markets higher Wednesday as oil prices  surged on hopes that a deal from OPEC may cut back production.  Oil drilling stocks, or those focused on exploration and  production, were the best performers in the sector. Oklahoma  City-based Devon Energy leaped more than 13.5 percent in  morning trade, while Marathon Oil and Transocean climbed more than 10.5 percent,  and Diamond Offshore  Drilling rose 9 percent.   Shares of Helmerich & Payne were about 5 percent  higher.   "At this point, if this (OPEC deal) is true, this is definitely a  bullish perspective for all oil stocks, especially upstream," the  exploration and production companies, said Luana Siegfried,  energy equity research associate at Raymond James. Reports indicated that OPEC struck a deal in Vienna on Wednesday, though the cartel had yet to make any formal announcement as U.S. markets opened.
