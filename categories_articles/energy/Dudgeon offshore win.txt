WindThe 402MW capacity Dudgeon offshore wind farm situated off the coast of Norfolk, UK, has started its activity. The park is owned by Norwegian energy firm Statoil with 35% stake, Abu Dhabi-based green energy company Masdar with 35% and hydropower firm Statkraft, holding 30%.

The first turbine was installed at the site in January and with all the 67 turbines being configurated, the wind farm is now producing renewable electricity and offering it to the UK's grid. The turbines comprise Siemens' 6MW. Every turbine has a total height of 187m, rotor diameter - 157 meters, with a hub height of 110 meters.

The wind farm can generate sufficient power to meet the demands of around 410,000 British households. The park is likely to save at least 575,000 tonnes of CO2 and 13,000 tonnes of SO2 emissions per year. 

Statkraft has been a shareholder in the wind farm project since obtaining the 30% stake in 2012. Statoil will continue to perform its role during the wind farm's operations over its existence of 25 years. The energy firm thinks that funding the offshore wind farm represented a part of the company's strategy to widen its energy mix and develop significantly in renewable energy field. The company intends to invest minimum PS9.5 billion over the next few years in green energy sources.

Statkraft president and CEO Christian Rynning-Tonnesen said: "The way that the Dudgeon project has been delivered embodies the strengths and culture of the companies involved, Statoil, Masdar and Statkraft.
