WindVestas is to deliver eight V126-3.8MW turbines as part of a partnership with ECN Wind Energy Facilities at the 30MW Wieringermeer test project in the Netherlands.
 The Danish manufacturer will supply the hardware, which will sit atop towers of 117 metres, and provide foundations and installation of the units.
 
Delivery of the turbines will begin in the first quarter of next year.
 
The Wieringermeer test project will explore how to "drive forward renewable energy power plant productivity and improve grid integration, Vestas said.
 
The site is an extension to the existing nine-turbine test site for prototypes.
 
"With this order, Vestas will provide the eight serially-produced turbines for regular energy production, which ECN Wind Energy Facilities may use to perform tests on behalf of third parties. Such tests could include operational strategies to optimise output and grid integration," said Vestas.
