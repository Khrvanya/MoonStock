NuclearEDF Energy has been granted approval to restart a reactor at its Hunterston B nuclear power plant in Scotland where cracks were found last year.The reactor had remained offline for safety checks and earlier this year, around 370 hairline fractures were discovered in the graphite bricks at the centre of the core of the nuclear reactor.
 
The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) has, however, given the green light for EDF Energy Nuclear Generation to bring Reactor 4 back to service for around four months of operation following a "long and detailed assessment of the safety case" submitted by the energy company.
 
The regulator said it is "satisfied" the reactor is safe to operate and can be safely shut down in all foreseeable circumstances - including that of a significant seismic event - and the core would be able to fulfil its fundamental safety requirements.
