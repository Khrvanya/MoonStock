Natural GasFrom January through June of 2019, US net natural gas exports averaged 4.1 billion ft3/d, more than double the average net exports in 2018 (2.0 billion ft3/d), according to data in the US Energy Information Administration's (EIA) Natural Gas Monthly. The US became a net natural gas exporter (exported more than it imported) on an annual basis in 2017 for the first time in almost 60 years.The US exports natural gas by pipeline to neighbouring Canada and Mexico and exports liquefied natural gas (LNG) to several other countries. Much of the recent increase in total exports is a result of more LNG facilities coming online. Total US exports of LNG through the first half of 2019 were 37% higher compared with the same period in 2018. Total US LNG export capacity as of June 2019 was 5.4 billion ft3/d across four facilities and nine liquefaction trains.
 
Two new liquefaction units - referred to as trains - came online in the first half of 2019: Cameron LNG Train 1 in Louisiana and Corpus Christi LNG Train 2 in Texas. Cameron LNG was the fourth US LNG export facility placed into service since February 2016. Cameron LNG, which will have a capacity of 1.7 billion ft3/d when its three liquefaction trains are completed, shipped its first cargo in May 2019 (as part of the initial commissioning process) and then another one in June before ramping up operations in July and August. Corpus Christi LNG Train 2, with a capacity of 0.6 billion ft3/d, shipped its first cargo in July and reached substantial completion in September.
 
More LNG facilities have come online in the second half of 2019: the first train at Freeport LNG in Texas, with a capacity of 0.7 billion ft3/d, and the first ten trains at Elba Island in Georgia, with a capacity of 0.03 billion ft3/d. These two new LNG export facilities, along with the completion of Cameron LNG, will increase US LNG export capacity to 8.9 billion ft3/d by the end of 2020 from 4.9 billion ft3/d at the end of 2018.
