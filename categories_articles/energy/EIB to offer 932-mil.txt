Natural GasThe European Investment Bank (EIB) Board decided to provide a loan estimated at EUR 932 million for the 1850 km Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) to transport natural gas from Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz-2 gas field to Europe.The Shah Deniz Stage 2 project is foreseen to bring gas straight from Azerbaijan to Europe for the first time, launching the Southern Gas Corridor.

Around 16 billion cubic meters of Shah Deniz Stage 2  gas will be provided via more than 3500 kilometers of pipelines traversing Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Albania and under the Adriatic Sea to Italy.

The Southern Gas Corridor, estimated at more than $40 billion, is considered as one of the main energy projects for the EU, which aims the diversification of gas sources. The project plans the transportation of gas from the Caspian region to the European countries via Georgia and Turkey.

At a preliminary phase, the primary source for the Southern Gas Corridor projects is considered the gas produced in the Stage 2 of development of Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz field. Other sources can also link to this project at a later period.

The gas will be exported to Turkey and European markets, as part of the Shah Deniz Stage 2, by extending the South Caucasus Pipeline and the building of Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP) and Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP).
