RenewableThree support schemes for renewable energy in Denmark have been approved by the European Commission.They include a multi-technology tender scheme for onshore and offshore wind turbines and solar installations, with a budget of DKK842 million (PS101m) - projects will be selected through two tenders in 2018 and 2019 and will receive support in the form of a premium on top of the market price.
 
Another scheme supports onshore wind for test and demonstration projects outside the two national test centres for large turbines, with an expected budget of DKK200 million (PS24m) and a transitional aid initiative for onshore wind, with a DKK40 million (PS4.8m) budget.
 
They are part of Denmark's goal of supplying 50% of its energy use from renewable sources by 2030.
 
The Commission found all three schemes encourage the development of green energy technologies in line with EU state aid rules.
