Electricity MarketThe European Commission has approved six electricity backup schemes to ensure security of supply in the event of blackouts.The EC suggested that power capacity mechanisms in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy and Poland abide by the rules aimed at preserving competition in the market, ensuring a level playing field.

The schemes in Belgium and Germany represent strategic reserve hubs, keeping certain generation capacities outside the electricity market for operation only in case of emergency.

In France and Greece, the schemes promote demand response, under which customers are paid to reduce their electricity consumption when power is limited. With similar initiatives in Italy and Poland, capacity providers can also receive payments for being available to generate electricity when necessary.

European Competition Commissioner, Margrethe Vestager declared: "Capacity mechanisms can help to safeguard security of electricity supply, but they must be designed so as to avoid distortions of competition in energy markets. I am glad that our close co-operation with national authorities has enabled us to today approve well-designed capacity mechanisms in six EU countries. They will foster competition among all potential capacity providers to the benefit of consumers and our European energy market."
