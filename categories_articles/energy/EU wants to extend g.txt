Natural GasThe EU Commission suggested on Wednesday to modify EU Gas Directive to enhance the functioning of the EU internal energy market and develop stronger solidarity ties between the member countries.The amendment should complete the current Gas Directive (2009/73/EC) and specify that the central elements of EU energy legislation (third-party access, tariff regulation, ownership unbundling and transparency) will be enforced to all gas pipelines from and to third countries encompassed within EU's jurisdiction.

The Commission mentioned that the amendment would ensure that all pipelines that cross the European Union would stick to its regulations and it would contribute to attain the targets of the EU gas market, which comprises rising competition between gas suppliers while improving energy security in the EU. 

EU Commission representatives consider that ensuring efficient operations of all major pipelines under transparent regulatory environment will reduce the conflicts of interests between infrastructure operators and gas suppliers and will as well guarantee equitable tariff fixing. 

If the European Parliament and European Council approve the amendment, this one will become law. 

The EU increasingly depends on imported natural gas.
