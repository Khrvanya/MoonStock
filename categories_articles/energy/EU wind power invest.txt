RenewableInvestments in new wind energy capacity in Europe dropped to EUR22.3 billion (PS19.8bn) in 2017, or a 19% decline from 2016 as the sector saw lower costs, according to the latest data from WindEurope.While offshore wind investments fell by 60% to EUR7.5 billion (PS6.7 billion), onshore investments reached a record level of EUR14.8 billion (PS13 billion).
 
Still, the investments backed a record 11.5GW of projects, or 2.5GW in offshore and 9GW in onshore wind.

Onshore wind capacity increased by 12.5GW and offshore wind by 3.1GW, representing around 55% of all power capacity installations in 2017.

The report states: "Cost reductions across the industry's value chain and increased industry competition have made it possible for investors to finance more capacity for less cash."

Germany was the major investor, generating EUR6.7 billion (PS6bn) for new onshore and offshore wind farms, or 30% of the total investments made last year. Meanwhile, the UK generated around EUR5 billion (PS4.4bn), or 22% of the total investments.
