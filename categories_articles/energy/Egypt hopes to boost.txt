Electricity MarketIn the next two years, Egypt plans to increase its electrical generation capacity by 20 GW.According to media reports data, the overall capacity of conventional power plants in the country is now estimated at 37.9 GW, in addition to 890 MW of green energy.

The target for 2020, is to add 20.1 GW to the energy capacity, to hit a total figure of 58 GW. Around 34.4 GW of the total amount will be obtained from high-efficiency combined cycle stations. Approximately 7 GW of wind power is likely to be added by 2022, as well as 2.8 GW from solar power units.

From the next financial year, network demands might be covered primarily by the combined cycle stations, hydropower and clean energy, generating 20% fuel savings.
