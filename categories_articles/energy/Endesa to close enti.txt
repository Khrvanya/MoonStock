CoalEndesa plans to close all its Iberian coal-fired power stations, ending production from two of Spain's largest power stations, the 1.4 GW As Pontes and 1.1 GW Litoral de Almeria plants, it said late Friday.Continued operation of uncompetitive coal plants "is not foreseeable in the future" due to the change in market conditions, notably the increase in CO2 prices, the Enel-owned utility said.
 
Endesa and partner Naturgy are in the process of dismantling the first unit to close -- the 347 MW Anllares plant.
 
It had previously announced an intention to close the 1 GW Compostilla 2 and 1.1 GW Teruel plants, rather than retrofit them with equipment to reduce pollutants.
