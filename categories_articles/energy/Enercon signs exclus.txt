WindGermany's Enercon GmbH has signed an exclusivity agreement with Chilean power utility Colbun SA, securing an option to supply turbines for the 607-MW Horizonte onshore wind project in the Atacama Desert.Enercon said in its magazine Windblatt that it is in line to supply 132 units of the E-160 wind turbines from the EP5 platform in what will be the manufacturer's largest purchase in Chile.
 
Given Chile's location in an earthquake-prone area, the turbine maker will be adapting the modular steel tower for the E-160 machines to meet the country's seismic code requirements. It will also have to lower their hub height to make the turbines suitable for the wind conditions at the site.
 
Enercon sales manager in Chile and project coordinator, Carla Tapia, told Windblatt that the wind speed at the site remains unchanged or even decreases with increasing hub height. In this case, the optimal turbine for the project should have between 90 metres and 110 metres in hub height.
