NuclearEngie Electrabel, the Belgian subsidiary of French energy group Engie, has postponed the planned outage of one of its nuclear reactors due to a delay in the delivery of some required parts, a spokesman said on Tuesday.The Tihange 1 reactor was due to undergo maintenance from August until mid-February to replace some parts and complete other work needed for its lifetime extension of 10 years from 2015 to 2025.
 
The delay in the delivery of some parts has pushed back the planned outage to a period from the end of December to July 10, Engie Electrabel spokesman Olivier Desclee said, making the reactor available during the high-demand November and December months.
 
Concerns over an energy shortage arose last year when six of Belgium's seven nuclear reactors - which produce about half of the country's electricity - were offline.
