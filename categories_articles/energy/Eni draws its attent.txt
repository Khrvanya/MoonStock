Oil MarketItaly's Eni is examining Crete's sites as Greece intends to initiate its offshore oil and gas development. Greek media sources say that the Italian oil company is inclined to move from the neighbouring Cypriot market into the Greek one to further East Mediterranean exploration.
 
It is being circulated that Eni is not the only company to be interested in the area. 
 
The consortium of Hellenic Petroleum, Total SA, and Edison are envisaging the same site as well. 
 
This agitation over the area of development places Greece at a very favourable negotiating position before cutting the deal with one of the competitors.
 
The chief of the Hellenic Hydrocarbons Resources Management Co. stated in August that Greece foresees three lucrative exploration wells by 2020.
