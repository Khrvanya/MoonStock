CO2Italian energy group Eni promised to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 and invest more in renewable energy as it steps up its pivot to cleaner energy.In its new business plan it said its oil and gas production, forecast to grow by 3.5% a year, would peak in 2025 before declining.
 
The state-controlled group, which will invest an overall 32 billion euros ($34.78 billion) by 2023, also pledged to pay higher dividends.
 
Descalzi's second three-year term leading Eni comes to an end in May and the veteran oil man is under pressure to prove to the Italian government he can shift the group towards cleaner sources of energy without inflicting too much damage on profitability.
 
Rivals such as Repsol, Shell and, more recently, BP had gone further than Eni, and Descalzi was under pressure to set bolder goals.
 
Descalzi has now announced one of the most ambitious emission cutting programs in the industry since the 80% target, which applies to all its businesses, covers what Eni produces and what it buys from third parties.
