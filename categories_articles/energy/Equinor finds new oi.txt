Oil MarketEquinor and its partner ENI and Petoro have completed the drilling of appraisal well on the Cape Vulture discovery in the Norwegian Sea.The appraisal of the Cape Vulture discovery has confirmed a volume potential of 50-70 million recoverable barrels of oil.
 
The oil find more than doubles the remaining oil reserves that can be produced from the Norne field.
 
Located 7km northwest of the production vessel on the Norne field, the exploration drilling in the Cape Vulture well began in early December 2016. The drilling of the Cape Vulture appraisal well was carried out by the Songa Encourage rig.
 
The Norne field, which started production in 1997, was originally planned for shutdown in 2014. However, the productive life of the field has already been extended to 2036.
 
Currently, the remaining recoverable oil reserves in the five fields producing through the Norne FPSO are estimated to be about 40 million barrels. The fields include Norne field, Alve, Urd, Skuld and Marulk.
 
With a stake of 63.95%, Equinor is the operator of the license. Eni and Petoro own stakes of 11.5% and 24.55%, respectively.
