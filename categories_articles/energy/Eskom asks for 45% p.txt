Electricity MarketSouth African state-run power utility Eskom has submitted a request to the domestic regulator NERSA (National Energy Regulator of South Africa) for a 45% electricity price hike spread over the next three years. Public hearings on Eskom's demand for an initial 15% electricity tariff increase are expected to start later in January 2019.This is much higher than the 4.41% increase over 2019-2020 that was already granted to Eskom by Nersa. The company argued that this 15% increase will be necessary to ensure the implementation of its current growth strategy.
 
Eskom suffers from significant financial difficulties and recently delayed its development strategy. The utility also scrapped its plans to add 9,600 MW of nuclear power capacity by 2030. Instead, it will focus on gas-fired, wind and solar power plants.
