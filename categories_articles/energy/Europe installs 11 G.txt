SolarThe European Union has achieved a 36% year-on-year increase in solar installations last year, with about 8 GW connected to the grid compared to 5.9 GW in 2017, statistics by SolarPower Europe show.The solar power sector association said today that solar installations in all of Europe rose by about 20% to 11 GW in 2018, Germany being the largest market with 2.96 GW of fresh capacity representing a 68% year-on-year surge. The other markets in the top three were Turkey with 1.64 GW, down 37%, and the Netherlands with 1.4 GW compared to 0.77 GW in the prior year. SolarPower Europe referred to the Dutch market as "a rising solar star".
 
Apart from Turkey, other non-EU markets contributing to the 11-GW European total include Norway, Russia, Serbia, Ukraine and others.
 
Michael Schmela, executive advisor and head of market intelligence at SolarPower Europe, noted that the EU solar market growth could have been even more impressive in 2018 if not for a sudden demand pull from China, which has led to a supply shortage for panels in Europe and project delays to 2019.
