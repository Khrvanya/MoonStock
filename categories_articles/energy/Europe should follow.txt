RenewableEddie O'Connor, the Founder and Chairman of Mainstream Renewable Power suggests that European countries should follow the advice given by French President Emmanuel Macron and cooperate to develop an interconnected energy market based on renewable energy instead of fossil fuels.  He also said that establishing links between the states with a "super-grid" would enable the delivery of cheaper electricity to consumers across Europe and allow the continent and the EU to reach its climate targets.
 
This suggestion came from President Macron's recent plan where he reveals his intentions to "ecologically transform" the continent. 

Mr. O'Connor also considers that this can be attained by getting an architect to design a "meshed grid" to operate as an "electric super-highway", carrying electricity between countries. For example, the wind generation from Ireland could supply customers across Europe during stormy weather, while Spanish solar power could light up homes in Dublin during sunny times.

The Chairman declared: "Last year, for the first time ever, Europe generated more electricity from wind, solar and biomass than from coal. This is a clear sign that a transformation is underway, but we need to go further, faster."

Recently, a new high power charging network for electric vehicles across European cities and motorways has been announced.
