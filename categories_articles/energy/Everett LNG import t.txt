LNGA division of US-based energy firm Exelon has come to an agreement with France's Engie on purchasing the Everett LNG import terminal in Everett, Massachusetts, on the US' east coast.The acquisition will permit Exelon Generation to provide some of the generators at its Mystic power station with fuel ahead of a scheduled closure in 2022.

The Mystic Generating Station's 7, 8 and 9 units, located as well in Everett, Massachusetts, are now functional, being all capable to burn natural gas, though the company declared it will only feed gas to units 8 and 9.

Exelon announced that the company will phase out units 7, 8 and 9 along with the Jet unit at Mystic Generating Station on 1 June 2022, unless regulatory reforms to adequately value reliability and regional fuel security are enforced.

The terminal was constructed in 1971 and represents the longest-operating LNG import facility of its kind in the United States. The facility has links with two interstate pipeline systems, as well as a local gas utility's distribution system.
