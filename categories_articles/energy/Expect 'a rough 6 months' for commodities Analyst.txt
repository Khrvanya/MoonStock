  Volatility in commodities will continue as long as Saudi Arabia's  next moves are unclear, RBC Capital Markets' chief commodities strategist told CNBC on Wednesday. Meantime, Helima Croft said, she expects "a rough six months."In an interview on "Squawk on the  Street" Croft said she thinks the Saudis will be  prepared to keep prices down only for the next six months to "bleed  out as much non-OPEC oil  production as they can." "We have a situation where the crown prince's son is quite senior  in the oil ministry, and there are some reports in The  Wall Street Journal that he's not entirely happy with  the lower-for-longer strategy. So I think we should look if there  is a shift in Saudi strategy," Croft said.

"Things could change if you have a new  king or somebody else scouting oil strategy in Saudi," she added.   Croft said that uncertainty with oil has had a negative spillover  effect on commodities, especially on metals.    "Any sign of an improving demand picture will certainly  rally the commodities complex," she said. "It's going to be a  rough six months and a lot of uncertainty until we know really  what OPEC is going to do." Read More  Copper collapses on global growth concerns
