  As international negotiations continue over Iran's controversial  nuclear program, Russia will likely try to spoil the deal,  Hermitage Capital CEO Bill Browder, a critic of the Russian  government, told CNBC on Monday.   Officials from global powers, called the P5+1, and Iran are in  talks to lift some or all economic sanctions in return for the  country abandoning its nuclear ambitions. Negotiations are  expected to resume on Wednesday, with the deadline for reaching  an agreement set for March 31.   If that agreement goes through, Iran could wind up selling its oil  freely on the international market, which is already facing oversupply, Browder said in an  interview with "Closing Bell."  Since Russia, an oil producer, is already suffering from low crude prices, President Vladimir Putin  has no financial interest in letting the deal happen, he  added.   "He also likes to be the international spoiler on anything going  on. He likes to be poking everybody between the eyes on these  types of things," said Browder, who is also the author of "Red  Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder and One Man's Fight  for Justice."  "It's in Putin's economic interest and in his interest in being  important to mess this thing up if he can." Read More   Oil prices have slumped about 60 percent since June. Weak global  demand, booming U.S. shale production and OPEC's refusal to cut its output are thought to be the  main reasons for the price drop.   Browder doesn't know exactly how Putin will try to spoil the  negotiations, but he said history is a guide.   "The way he intervenes in these situations is he'll come around  the backdoor with some type of offer to Iran to say listen if  you go along with this deal, we're not going to do this with  you."
