  November's employment report is expected to show a steady and  solid pace of hiring, but it may be the words of Fed officials  starting Monday that get more focus in the week ahead.  That's because investors have been debating which side of the  Fed's dual mandate will influence it more when it considers  raising interest rates. Traders are looking for clarification of  whether the labor side would trigger a Fed rate hike, as the  unemployment rate continues to improve. Or would it be that  sluggish inflation and fears of deflation are a strong enough  deterrent to keep the Fed on hold longer.
