NuclearUnits 1 and 2 of the Fessenheim nuclear power plant in eastern France will permanently shut down in February and June 2020, respectively, Secretary of State for Ecological and Solidarity Transition Emmanuelle Wargon said yesterday. Their closure had previously been set to coincide with the start-up of the Flamanville EPR, which has now been delayed until possibly the end of 2022.Wargon said the Fessenheim plant - France's two oldest reactors - would end production by the summer of 2020 in two phases. She said unit 1 would close by the end of February, with unit 2 following by the end of June. She was speaking at a meeting of the steering committee of the Fessenheim regional economic development project in Colmar. This aims to initiate projects in the region to counteract the economic and social impact of the plant's closure.
 
These dates differ slightly from those put forward last February by the then minister for an ecological and solidarity transition, Francois de Rugy, Agence France-Presse noted. He had mentioned closure dates of March 2020 for Fessenheim 1 and August 2020 for Fessenheim 2.
