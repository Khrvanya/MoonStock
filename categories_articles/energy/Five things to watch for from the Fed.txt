  Wall Street widely expects the word "patient" to be dropped from  the Fed statement as it signals pending rate hikes, but there are  several other potential bell ringers traders are watching.   Each has the ability to move stocks, the dollar and Treasury  yields, as the market handicaps when and how fast the Fed could  raise interest rates from near zero. Volatility could be high, and markets may react differently to the central bank's 2 p.m. EDT statement and Fed Chair Janet Yellen's later comments to the press."Get your helmet on," said Ward McCarthy, chief financial  economist at Jefferies."There's a lot invested in not only when the Fed starts raising rates but what happens to trajectory afterwards," he said.
