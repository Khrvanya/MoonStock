EnergyFossil fuels production in the US is likely to attain record levels in 2018 and 2019.According to Energy Information Administration (EIA), it is expected to average around 73 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) this year and hike to 75 quadrillion Btu in 2019. The study covers production of natural gas, crude oil, coal and hydrocarbon gas liquids (HGL).
    
In 2018, the EIA forecasts the natural gas production at approximately 80.4 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) - a 9% up from last year - and 83 Bcf/d 2018. Crude oil production might reach 10.3 million barrels per day - up 10% from last year - and 10.8 million barrels per day next year.

It reveals that record level production is mainly applicable to higher production of natural gas and crude oil empowered by the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques in tight rock formations.

Increases in crude oil production growth is expected to be the leading contributor in 2019. EIA foresees growing natural gas production to be the upfront contributor to total fossil fuel generation in 2018. In both years, predicted growth in natural gas, crude oil and HGL output more than counterbalance forecasted declines in coal production.
