SolarFrance commissioned 707 MW of new solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity in the first nine months of 2019, bringing cumulative grid-connected installations to 9,649 MW, government statistics show.At the end of September, France had a total of 445,772 grid-connected solar parks after 20,375 plants became operational in the first three quarters of 2019. The newly-commissioned capacity was 1% below the 711 MW brought online in the year-ago period, according to the data provided by the French energy ministry's Department of Data and Statistical Studies (SDES).
 
The regions New Aquitaine, Occitanie, Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes and Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur accounted for 69% of the new installations in terms of capacity.
 
France's solar parks produced 9.5 TWh of electricity in January-September, rising from 8.7 TWh a year earlier thanks to favourable solar conditions. Photovoltaics supplied 2.8% of the country's electricity demand during the nine-month period, up by 0.3 points from a year earlier.
