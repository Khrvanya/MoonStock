WindThe French government on Monday unveiled plans for the construction of a 1-GW wind fark off the coast of Normandy.The proposed 1-GW offshore wind park will use up to 80 turbines of around 12 MW each, which will be installed in a seabed area with "very favourable" wind conditions, the Ministry for an Ecological and Solidarity Transition said in a press release. The plan will be open for discussions in a public debate between November 15, 2019, and May 15, 2020.
 
France is seeking to almost double its installed renewables capacity to 113 GW by 2028 in an effort to cut its reliance on nuclear power and phase out coal. It aims to reach 40% renewables power by 2030.
 
This summer, France lifted its target for offshore wind installations to 1 GW annually, expecting its offshore wind capacity to be 2.4 GW in 2023 and reach between 4.7 GW and 5.2 GW in 2028. A tender for the 600-MW Dunkirk offshore wind project was won by a group led by Electricite de France SA (EPA:EDF) in June.
