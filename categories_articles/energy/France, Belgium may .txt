Electricity MarketFrance and Belgium are at risk of facing a winter supply squeeze in January in the event of a severe cold spell, European TSO group Entso-E said in its latest seasonal outlook on Wednesday.A combination of low temperatures, muted renewable generation and unplanned outages from power generation and on transmission lines would mean the two countries would have to rely on imports and perhaps take preventive measures to avoid rolling blackouts.
 
"In some cases, they even may be looking for available out-of-market measures and regional cooperation to prevent the local demand-shedding," said Entso-E.
 
It added that a supply risk could occur when the daily average temperature drops to -5C, nearly 10C lower than the normal January temperature, which was "rather unlikely in the region".
 
"Such conditions would require system reliability to be tightly monitored closer to the operational timeframe with the support of regional security coordinators (RSCs)," said the group.
 
Entso-E's probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed the risk was highest in week 3 next year.
