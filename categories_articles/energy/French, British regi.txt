NuclearAs part of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Nuclear South West and Nucleopolis, the organisations will share knowledge and opportunities in the nuclear industry and encourage their respective members to explore opportunities to work together.They aim to connect companies with GBP50 billion (USD65 billion) worth of nuclear investments in South West England and an annual market in Normandy worth more than GBP1 billion per year.

Nuclear South West - a partnership of industry, academic and public sector organisations - was set up in 2016 to champion the South West nuclear industry as the premier destination for investment, innovation and growth.

Nucleopolis is the nuclear division of Normandie Energies, the Norman energy mix cluster. It brings together the expertise of nearly 100 French organisations, covering research, industry and training, in the fields of energy, health and risk management. The nuclear sector employs around 28,000 people in Normandy.

The signing of the MoU follows a report commissioned by Nuclear South West which shows that the region is ideally placed to capitalise on economic opportunities worth GBP50 billion to the UK economy. The research states that SMEs, large companies and training providers in the region could supply GBP15 billion worth of work to the nuclear sector.

EDF Energy's Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant project in Somerset is expected to create 25,000 job opportunities, 1000 apprenticeships and inject some GBP100 million into the regional economy annually. The region also host the shutdown Oldbury nuclear power plant, where Horizon Nuclear Power proposes to construct two advanced boiling water reactor units. It is also home to the South West Nuclear Hub incorporating the Nuclear Research Centre, as well as the National College for Nuclear.
