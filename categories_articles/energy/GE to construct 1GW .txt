CoalUnder the terms of engineering procurement and commissioning (EPC) accord, GE-controlled group will build the Ostroleka C ultra-supercritical (USC) coal-fired power plant for Polish state-run utilities Energa and Enea.As per the contract terms, GE Power, in addition to co-leading the consortium, will be in charge for the designing, manufacturing and supplying USC technology components comprising boiler and steam turbine generator, for the new power plant.

GE affirmed that with USC technology, the plant will perform to the highest efficiency level possible for a steam power plant in Poland with 46% efficiency, much higher than the world average of 33% efficiency.

The power plant, subject to financial closure, is scheduled to be commissioned within 56 months after obtaining notice to proceed. It is planned to produce electricity necessary to light 300,000 Polish homes.

Also, GE Power will offer advanced environmental control systems including electrostatic precipitators and wet flue gas desulfurization plant for the Ostroleka C power plant.

GE declared that the high efficiency and low emissions technologies guarantee that the Ostroleka C plant will be in line with the latest European Union (EU) standards in terms of local emissions.

Separately, GE's Power Services business has decided to boost performance of Candela combined-cycle power station in Puglia, Italy.

The agreement inked with Edison, a division of Electricite de France (EDF Group), requests hardware upgrades to the existing GE 9F.03 gas turbine at the power plant in a bid to bolster the plant's production by 5% to hit 400MW and cut gas consumption by 2%.
