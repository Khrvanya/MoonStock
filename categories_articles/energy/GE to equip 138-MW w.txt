WindThe renewable energy arm of General Electric Co has won a turbine supply contract for the 138-MW Saros wind project in Turkey.Renewable energy producer Borusan EnBW Enerji, which was created in 2009 by Turkish group Borusan and Germany's EnBW, has ordered 27 units of GE's Cypress turbines with a rotor diameter of 158 metres. GE has also received a 10-year service deal.
 
The Saros project will require an investment of about USD 190 million (EUR 169m). Upon completion, the wind park will generate some 530 GWh of electricity per year, enough to meet the energy demand of roughly 190,000 homes.
 
GE's unit LM Wind Power will produce the two-pieces blades for the purchased Cypress turbines at its factory in Bergama, Izmir. Towers for the machines will be manufactured in Turkey as well.
