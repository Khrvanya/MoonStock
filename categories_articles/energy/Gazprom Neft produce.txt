Oil MarketThe 12-millionth tonne of ARCO (Arctic-blend) oil has now been produced and shipped from Gazprom Neft's Prirazlomnaya offshore platform, delivered by the Kirill Lavrov ice-class shuttle tanker to the Kola Bay, where the Umba storage tanker is harboured, and from where it will be shipped, in standard batches, to Europe.The Prirazlomnoye field is the first -- and, thus far, the only -- project at which oil is being produced on the Russian Arctic Shelf. Commercial development of this field has seen 18 wells drilled, with construction of the 19th due for completion in the immediate future.
 
Safe year-round oil shipments from the Prirazlomnoye field, and effective logistical project support in the freezing Barents Sea, are ensured through the ice management system the company has in place here -- a further key element of which will be the Ice Situation Management Centre currently being put in place. Using specially developed software, this centre will receive and analyse data generated from regional and local monitoring of hydro-meteorological and ice conditions.
