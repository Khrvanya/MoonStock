Electricity MarketGermany's gas industry aims to build power-to-gas capacity of five gigawatts (GW) over the next five years, and 40 GW by 2050, as it seeks to develop zero-carbon fuels for homes, factories and vehicles, industry group DVGW said on Tuesday.The target comes as policymakers aim to unveil a hydrogen strategy by year-end to help decarbonise Germany's fossil fuel-based gas system towards the use of hydrogen derived from water and biogas from crops and waste.
 
Currently Germany is home to around 40 small power-to-gas pilot projects. These harness surplus green power, mainly from wind, to carry out electrolysis, splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen to produce zero-carbon fuel.
 
The government must push renewables and other technologies to help cut carbon emissions by 55% of their 1990 level by 2030, having achieved less than 20%.
