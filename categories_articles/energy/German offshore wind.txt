"The construction time of just three months for 60 six-megawatt wind turbines, including loading, weather downtimes and technical maintenance, was faster than ever before in the industry," it said, adding E.ON was setting a new industry standard as the company responsible for the construction and operation of Arkona.
 
The EUR1.2 billion wind farm started production in September 2018, and with construction completion expected within the next few months, is scheduled to go into full operation in 2019.
 
According to E.ON's statement, the Arkona wind farm will have a capacity of 385 megawatts and can theoretically supply around 400,000 households with renewable energy.
 
The wind farm is set to save up to 1.2 million tons of carbon dioxide annually compared to conventionally generated electricity.
