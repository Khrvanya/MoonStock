SolarThe solar market grew by about 30% in 2019 with almost 4GW of new projects installed, according to initial analysis by the German solar industry association BSW.The association said falling PV prices coupled with increased power prices, an intensifying climate debate and expanding electromobility were the main reasons for the growth.
 
But, despite the growth, more needs to be done to boost solar expansion in Germany if the country is to meet its climate goals, BSW warned.
 
Without further expansion of renewables, there is likely to be a power generation gap as a result of the phase-out of nuclear and coal-fired generation in the first half of the 2020s, Kornig said.
 
He called for the government to scrap a 52GW cap on support for the solar sector this month, otherwise the expansion of rooftop solar could halt in the spring of this year.
