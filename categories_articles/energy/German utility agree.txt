RenewableGermany's major power producer is grabbing onto a lifeline from the green energy business in the utility industry's biggest change in years.RWE AG's decision to take green power generation assets from Innogy SE in a complex asset swap puts the German utility back on track after it spun off Innogy in 2016. The move should contribute to bolster earnings that deal with decline in the next years as the government obliges nuclear and coal plants to phase out.

Per Lekander, a fund manager at Lansdowne Partners UK LLP, declared: "For RWE, it is a game changer - it was a dying business, now it has a life."

At present, RWE's biggest electricity production assets in Germany are the ones that pollute the most, using a soft form of coal called lignite. RWE aims to ensure safe supply and strives for growth in gas-fired power generation, a cleaner fossil fuel that already forms up about 40 per cent of the company's overall capacity in Europe. The company also plans to enlarge its activity in liquefied natural gas trading.
