CO2The global energy demand increased by 2.1% last year, leading to a hike in carbon emissions for the first time since 2014, according to IEA. The statistics show that CO2 level jumped more than twice compared to 2016.That happened because of strong global economic growth, with oil, gas and coal being responsible for 70% of the growth and renewables accounting for almost all of the rest.

Improvements in energy efficiency weakened, which contributed to a surge in global energy-related carbon emissions by 1.4% in 2017, after three years of being stable.

Carbon emissions hit a historical peak of 32.5 gigatonnes but it did not raise everywhere, while most big economies witnessed a hike, the US, UK, Mexico and Japan experienced declines, with the most extensive decline registered in the US for higher renewables deployment.

IEA Executive Director Dr Fatih Birol declared: "The significant growth in global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2017 tells us that current efforts to combat climate change are far from sufficient. For example, there has been a dramatic slowdown in the rate of improvement in global energy efficiency as policymakers have put less focus in this area."
