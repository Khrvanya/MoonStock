CO2Due to major changes in the global energy landscape, especially related to electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable generation, CO2 emissions are expected to be quite the same by 2030.Data and analytics specialist McKinsey Energy Insights (MEI), predicts that 20% of global car sales will be EVs by 2030, increasing from 3% in 2020.

According to the report, green energy is likely to take almost all the growth in global electricity production in 2050 and forecasts it will become more reasonable to build renewable capacity than operate existing gas- or coal-fired power plants within a decade.

He added this will cause further drops in fossil-fuel power plant use, with solar and wind rising 10 times faster than gas.

Despite renewables expansion, MEI says that increased global energy demand might signify that emissions at more than double level than international climate commitments.

Ole Rolser, Associate Partner and Solution Leader at MEI, declared: "Despite the significant momentum around EVs and renewable energy sources taking an increasing share of the power market, energy-related emissions remain flat from 2030 to 2050. To realise the 2degC pathway scenario, we'd have to see much broader, much more disruptive change than what we're seeing now"
