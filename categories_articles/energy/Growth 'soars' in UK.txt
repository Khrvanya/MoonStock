EnergyOver 10,500MW of battery storage planning applications have been made in the UK, compared with 6900MW a year ago, according to new research from RenewableUK (R-UK).The trade body's latest Project Intelligence report said that the number of companies involved in the sector is now more than 450, up from about 300 this time last year.
 
R-UK said that average project rose slightly in the last 12 months to 28MW from 27MW previously.
 
"The pipeline of storage projects is expected to continue growing and an increasing number of grid-scale battery projects of over 50MWs are expected, after BEIS agreed earlier this year to change planning rules which have, up to now, deterred development at this scale," it added.
 
The report said that renewables developers are at the forefront of the market.
 
It said the UK also has a pipeline of over 600MW of compressed air or liquid air storage projects in development.
