  To freeze or not to freeze — that is the question oil  watchers want to know.  In April OPEC hinted that a production freeze was coming  and, for weeks leading up, investors collectively wrung their  hands in advance of a decision.    Of course, the cartel failed to reach an agreement and member  nations continued producing oil at record levels. Now, as OPEC plans to hold an informal meeting  in September, one trader remains bullish on crude regardless of  any sort of deal being reached.   "I actually think positioning was overly bearish," noted a  skeptical Tim Seymour in a special "Behind the Trade" session.   The CNBC "Fast Money" trader illustrated that, while oil has  been in a bear market during the past month, investors have  bought into the commodity amid oversold conditions during the  past week leading to gains of 8 percent. Furthermore, he believes  that the setup for higher oil prices can be credited to the  notion that the global economy is significantly stronger. Namely, the Brexit vote failed to shake markets as many investors predicted it  would and volume has remained high during the summer, which  historically represents slower months for traders.   Seymour also noted that the traditional relationship between crude and the dollar has begun to break down. "Oil and the dollar,  historically, have been negatively correlated. When oil was  getting hammered, the dollar was spiking. The key is that in the  last couple of days, they are trading together."    From here, Seymour reasoned that while gains for the dollar are  likely capped at $100, oil has room to run and will likely settle  in the $50 range. "This correlation is a long-term trend that I think is breaking  down," he concluded. "Oil goes higher from here." Year to date oil is up 16 percent and has gained 6.5 percent  since April's OPEC meeting in Doha, Qatar.
