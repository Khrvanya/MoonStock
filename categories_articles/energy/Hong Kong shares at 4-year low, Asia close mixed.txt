Federal  Reserve chair Janet Yellen began her semiannual  congressional testimony in the U.S. overnight, where she  addressed mounting whispers about whether the Fed could implement  negative interest rates as a way to boost economic activity. She  said the central bank has not completely researched whether that  would be legal.  Asked if she foresaw the Fed cutting rates soon, having only  hiked rates in December for the first time nine years, Yellen  said she did not expect that to happen any time soon as she  considered the risk of a U.S. recession to be low.  Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset  Management, said in a Wednesday note that there were three key  takeaways from Yellen's testimony. First, the Fed hadn't made up  its mind about March, but chances are it won't raise rates. Secondly, the  central bank is also very worried about financial market  volatility, a strong dollar, wider credit spreads, and low oil  prices. But finally, it is optimistic about the labor market and the  impact that wage gains will have on spending.  Morgan Stanley said in a note, though, that Yellen's testimony  wasn't dovish enough to assuage growth and inflation concerns  that are building in global markets.   "Until the Fed makes clear that 'gradual' could mean only one or  two rate hikes in 2016 instead of three or four, or until the Fed  changes the narrative away from rate hikes altogether, we think  risk markets will struggle in the absence of positive catalysts,"  Morgan Stanley analysts said.
