  Oil is back on the market's radar, after recent chatter from OPEC  representatives fueled new speculation over possible actions from  the cartel if prices remained low. OPEC said earlier this month that it would meet at the sidelines  of an energy conference in September. Last week, the  biggest OPEC producer, Saudi Arabia, said it was on board with  the possibility of discussing actions if prices remained low due  to oversupply. U.S crude futures rallied 9 percent last week, while Brent  futures added 6.7 percent. But experts said they see little chance of an agreement among  OPEC members to freeze production. Indeed, earlier this year,  OPEC and non-OPEC producers failed to reach an agreement on  freezing output levels. In this week's Trader Poll, tell us how you are trading oil, if  at all.
