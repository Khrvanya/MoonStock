 Crude oil's trading range provides a great  opportunity. Crude traded surprisingly well late in  the day yesterday, after clearing stops below Wednesday's $90  low.

This did not end of happening, and the non-event  actually pulled the dollar back slightly off of the highs,  allowed crude to hold against its swing highs and current action  at $90.75.   In the early hours of trading, crude failed against $91, and  cleared stops below $90 after inventory reports. However, it in  fact held this week's $89.33 low. This turnaround should lead to  a test of major resistance at the $92 level, which now holds a  large amount of volume to accompany the 100-day and 200-day moving  averages.   So how should you look to trade crude?  The bottom line is to play the range: Buy against $89.33 with a  tight stop, says Ilczyszyn.  But if the trade stops working, get out! Make sure to stay  reality-based.
