SolarHungary will promote renewable energy by simplifying rules on the building of small solar power facilities and subsidizing loans to landowners. At present, the nation's single nuclear power site offers over 50% of Hungary's electricity, and approximately 29 percent of its electricity is imported, a figure the government wishes to reduce.

Janos Lazar, Prime Minister Viktor Orban's chief of staff, declared: "The government supports the creation of as many solar power plants in Hungary as possible." 

He also stated that new regulations would facilitate the use of farmland. The government would also provide subsidized loans from state-owned development bank MFB. The aid will be directed to farmers or companies to fund the construction of solar plants with a capacity of almost 0.5 megawatt.

The program's long-term target would be to cut electricity imports in the next two decades and to increase the green energy by 13 percent. According to a 2017 progress report by the European Commission, alternative sources of energy represent less than a tenth of Hungary's energy consumption in 2013.

Lazar said the Hungarian energy regulator released 2,600 solar power plant authorizations at the end of 2016, around half of which are still in construction.
 
The country's Paks nuclear power site is on the path to be extended with two new reactors through a 12.5 billion-euro ($15 billion) transaction with Russia's Rosatom.
