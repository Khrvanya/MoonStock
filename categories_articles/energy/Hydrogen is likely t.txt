BiofuelsHydrogen could take the place of gas and become the main fuel of the transport industry, Arup's environment and resources manager Mike Straughton said.  
Attending the Australian Financial Review's National Energy Summit, Mr. Straughton highlighted the growing value of hydrogen as a future energy source. 

By 2030, the number of hydrogen-powered vehicles is likely to hit millions.
 
The speaker also stressed that hydrogen has all the premises for replacing natural gas and become the key fuel.  
 
The energy giants, Shell and Total, are extremely interested in the hydrogen field, investing and forecasting investment of almost $13.7 billion within the next five years. 

Moreover, Mr. Straughton added that hydrogen fuel cells are more efficient than electric batteries for long-distance transportation.

It is also known that hydrogen-powered vehicles have zero emissions, as these eject only water vapour.
