SolarIberdrola SA has completed the construction of the 500-MW Nunez de Balboa solar photovoltaic (PV) park in Spain and is now preparing to put it online.The Spanish energy giant said Friday it recently received commissioning permit from the ministry for ecological transition, while Spain's grid operator Red Electrica de Espana (REE) has already initiated energisation tests.
 
The PV park is expected to start operations in the first quarter of 2020.
 
The mega project, touted as Europe's largest PV park, involved an investment of close to EUR 300 million (USD 334.6m), with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and Spanish state-owned bank Instituto de Credito Oficial (ICO) providing most of the financing.
 
Nunez de Balboa occupies an area of around 1,000 hectares (2,471 acres) in Badajoz province in the Spanish region of Extremadura. The project employed more than 1,200 workers during peak workload periods. The effort resulted in the installation of 1.43 million photovoltaic (PV) panels and 115 inverters in one year, and the construction of two substations.
