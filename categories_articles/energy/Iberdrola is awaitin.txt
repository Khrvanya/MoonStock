CoalIberdrola energy firm has expressed its intentions to close two Spanish coal-fired power sites with an overall capacity of 874MW as part of its goal to eliminate its world thermal power generation capacity.In this sense, the Spanish power company Iberdrola has presented a permit request with the Ministry of Energy, Tourism and Digital Strategy to completely close the 358MW Lada (Asturias) and 516MW Velilla (Palencia) coal-fired power facilities.

Iberdrola declared that the 170 workers of the two power plants will be relocated to other units or will be directed for the four-year decommissioning process estimated at EUR35 million. The process of plants closure will be subject to authorization from Spanish Ministry of Energy. Iberdrola declares that with the shutdown of the two plants, it comes closer to its target to reduce carbon emissions by 50% in 2030 and budges towards becoming carbon neutral in 2050.

At present, coal-fired plants generate 1.8% of Iberdrola's 48GW capacity. The company has 28.7GW of renewable electricity production worldwide. It has eliminated around 7.5GW of its coal-fired power capacity globally since 2001. The phase-out refers to Cockenzie and Longannet thermal power stations in the UK in 2013 and 2016 respectively, with a total capacity of 3.6GW.

Iberdrola affirms that due to positive impact of continuous decarbonization of its electricity generation mix, over the past 15 years, the company has become a reference point in the fight against climate change globally, having invested EUR90 billion in the decommissioning process. 

Currently, the company has become a leader in onshore wind while cutting emissions to 70% below its European colleagues. This figure represents an enormous growth of 75% since 2000.
