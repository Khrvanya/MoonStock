RenewableIberdrola SA, the world's biggest wind power producer, plans to expand its renewable capacity in the United States by about 50 percent over four years as part of the Spanish electric utility's global plan to reduce carbon emissions, its chief executive told Reuters on Monday.Ignacio Galan, who was in New York to speak at the United Nations' Global Compact Leaders Summit, said the company expects to spend about $15 billion in the United States on its transmission and distribution system and increase its renewable generation to around 10,000 megawatts (MW) by the end of 2022.
 
"More and more investors are looking for companies with clean energy and sustainability goals," Galan said, noting Iberdrola sells the energy that helps those companies meet those targets.
 
Iberdrola committed to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions intensity by 50 percent by 2030 compared to 2007 levels and become carbon neutral by 2050. More than half of its 48,800 MW of generation around the world is renewable with the remainder fueled mostly by natural gas, nuclear and coal. Galan said the company wants to shut its last two coal plants, which are located in Spain, by 2020.
 
Through its majority-owned Avangrid Inc subsidiary, Iberdrola has over 6,500 MW of renewables in the United States. It is the country's third-biggest wind power provider behind NextEra Energy and Berkshire Hathaway.
