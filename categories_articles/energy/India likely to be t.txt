Energy MarketMoody's forecasts that the end of next year will see India in front of China as the fastest growing energy market in the world. 
According to a credit rating agency, Chinese economic activity slows down due to a moderate growth in the refined product demand to 2.5-3 percent in 2017 and 2018.

As a matter of fact, it is difficult to say if India will be able to surpass China, due to the economic uncertainty in both countries.  

Considering that oil sector counts on China and more on India, there are fears that demand will decline if economic growth slackens more than expected, the report said.

Asia will carry on importing fossil fuels to satisfy the need for energy because refining will not be able to sustain the regional energy necessity.

India wants to acquire oil from Russia, the United States, and any other reliable producer due to a fast increase of the middle class across the country.
