Last month, Zanganeh had said that the country's extraction of gas from the South Pars gas field would reach 750 million cubic meters per day by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 2020).
 
Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been cooled down to liquid form for ease and safety of non-pressurized storage or transport.
 
It takes up about 1/600th the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state.
