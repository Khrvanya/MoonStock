  Negotiations that could lead to sanctions relief for Iran could  also be bearish for oil prices over the next 18 months, said  Francisco Blanch, head of global commodities and derivatives  research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research.   "It's important to keep in mind that oil trades a month and a  half ahead, so if the sanctions are lifted in three months or in  four months, oil is going to start pricing that up pretty soon,"  he said Monday on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." "We could start to  see the pressure building as soon as Congress and the Senate  give [President Barack] Obama greater backing on the Iran deal."Read More  Why a deal with Iran is good for stocks  Blanch said he is looking to see what will happen to the 30  million-plus barrels of oil that Iran has floating offshore now  that could be delivered to the market relatively quickly if the  sanctions are lifted.  "The second thing is how much are Iranian volumes going to ramp  up on a forward basis as domestic production increases again," he  added.   Blanch also said that OPEC has ceased to operate as a cartel and  has "very little ability anymore to influence prices." That is  because Saudi Arabia has told that market that it will let prices  balance supply and demand, rather than adjust production volume  as it did in the past.
