Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said Tehran supports any move to stabilize the global oil market and lift prices, the Iranian oil ministry news agency SHANA quoted him as saying on Sunday."Instability and falling oil prices are harmful to all countries, especially oil producers," Rouhani was quoted as saying by SHANA."Tehran welcomes any move aimed at market stability and improvement of oil prices based on justice, fairness and fair quota of all the oil producers," the president said, referring to a meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC producers in Algeria next week, SHANA said.  Rouhani was speaking to Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa on the  sidelines of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit in Venezuela  on Saturday, SHANA reported.  Iran, OPEC's third-largest producer, has been boosting its oil  output after the lifting of Western sanctions in January. Tehran  refused to join a previous attempt this year by OPEC and  non-members such as Russia to stabilize production, and talks  collapsed in April.  OPEC members will meet on the sidelines of the International  Energy Forum (IEF), which groups producers and consumers, in  Algeria on Sept. 26-28. Non-OPEC producer Russia is also  attending the forum.  OPEC will probably revive talks on freezing oil production levels  when it meets non-OPEC nations in Algeria, sources have told  Reuters.  Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed this month to cooperate in oil  markets, saying they could limit future output.  However, on Saturday, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo  appeared to play down suggestions of a major agreement by saying  the Algiers meeting would be an informal meeting for  consultations and not for decision making, Algerian state news  agency APS reported.
