RenewableThe Irish government on Monday released the country's Climate Action Plan for 2019, which calls for a 70% renewables share in the total power mix by 2030.The ambitious plan almost triples the current 4.5 GW renewables capacity goal for 2030 as it calls for the installation of up to 8.2 GW of onshore wind, at least 3.5 GW of offshore wind and up to 1.5 GW of grid-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity. This new capacity will be deployed through a competitive framework of auctions and corporate contracting.
 
To achieve the 70% renewable electricity goal, the country plans to phase out coal and peat-fired electricity generation, while expanding renewables and reinforcing its grid through new interconnections that will allow power transfers between Ireland and other countries. This includes the Celtic Interconnector to France and further interconnection to the UK. Additionally, Ireland intends to put systems in place that will manage intermittent sources of power, especially from wind, according to the report.
