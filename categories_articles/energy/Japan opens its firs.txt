SolarJapan's first office building which is completely powered by off-the-grid solar energy, opened today in the city of Saga.Daiwa House Industry Company presents the two-story, 2,400-square-meter facility as a "net-zero energy building" as it utilizes green energy created on the site.

The building is part of homebuilder's Saga branch office but also it will show off the type of ecologically friendly office buildings the company can build for other firms.

The power produced by 320 solar panels on the roof is stored in lithium-ion batteries, which then provide electricity to keep the building operating through the night.

The construction can be proud of energy-saving equipment such as an air conditioning system utilizing solar heat and water in a well, which saves approximately Y=6 million per annum in power costs compared with an ordinary facility of the same size.

The total construction expenses were at Y=900 million, partially covered by government subsidies.
