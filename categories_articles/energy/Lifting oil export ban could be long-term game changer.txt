  The end of the 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports should have  little immediate impact on the U.S. oil industry, but longer term  it's likely to help U.S. shale producers and give the United  States more clout in a cut-throat, global energy arena.  The United States currently generates about 9.2 million barrels  of oil a day, about half of which is shale production. But the  U.S. also imported about 7 million barrels a day this year, so  with the world awash in crude, there is not likely to be much  demand for U.S. exports.  The U.S. is on the verge of ending the restriction, after congressional  negotiators late Tuesday included removing the ban in a deal  on a $1.15 trillion spending bill, along with such provisions as  the extension of tax breaks on solar and wind energy. And while an end to the ban wouldn't have a massive immediate effect on oil markets, it could drastically alter some parts of the domestic and global energy industry in the longer term.  "It's definitely an improvement, but it's not like the be-all and  end-all that's going to stop the bleeding in the oil patch," said  Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. "This is a small  thing compared to Iran coming back to the market with a million  barrels a day. … This reduces an artificial logistics  impediment."
