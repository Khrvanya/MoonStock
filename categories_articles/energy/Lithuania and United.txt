RenewableLithuania and United Arab Emirates (UAE) inked a memorandum of cooperation in the field of green energy and energy savings, aiming to encourage investments, to enhance technologies, scientific research and implementation of joint projects, as stated on Friday by the Lithuanian Energy Ministry.The Arabian government intends to offer a funding of $160 billion for the renewable energy sector over the next decades, ensuring that 44% of country's energy demand will be met by renewables by 2050.
 
The nation aims to raise the share of green energy, counting renewables and nuclear energy, to 24 percent by 2021.

Zygimantas Vaiciunas, Lithuania's Energy Minister said: "Both Lithuania and the U.A.E. are interested in cooperation in the field of energy. Though the U.A.E. has plentiful natural resources, the country has decided to intensively develop renewable energy,". 

He added that the collaboration accord opens extensive opportunities for providing advanced and innovative energy technologies, as the UAE possess the biggest oil stocks in the world. The Lithuanian firms gained a good experience in developing solar cell hubs, as well as knowledge about solar modules. 

One of the most ambitious solar project of U.A.E. is the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. It is expected to become world's largest (5,000 MW) solar plant farm, likely to be completed by 2030. But the Arab state is not investing only in complex solar systems, but also in small solar panels established on individual houses.

According to Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council, Lithuania fixed an objective to boost the share of renewable energy consumption up to 23 percent by 2020. The Lithuanian Department of Statistics announced that the country had already achieved this goal. In 2015, it attained 26%.

The UAE with 26 GW of installed capacity, depends on natural gas and LNG for power.
