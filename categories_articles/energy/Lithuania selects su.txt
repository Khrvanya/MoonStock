WindA subsidy-free project for a wind farm of about 75 MW is the winner in Lithuania's first technology-neutral renewables tender.Lithuania's National Energy Regulatory Council (VERT) said on Thursday that the UAB Windfarm Akmene One project has won support of 0.3 TWh in the auction with a bid of EUR 0 per MWh. It, however, did not give details about the capacity of the selected project.
 
VERT has received eight proposals in the tender, one of which failed to quality, with bids ranging between EUR 0/MWh and EUR 3.86 (USD 4.28) per MWh. Three projects took part in the competition with zero bids but the winner was the one offering the highest annual production of electricity. The tender was launched in September 2019 and will provide the winning scheme with priority access to the country's power grid for 12 years.
 
According to UAB Akmene's website, the 75-MW scheme is part of a larger project with an overall capacity of 400 MW. The first stage envisages the installation of 15 turbines of 5 MW near Lithuania's northern border with Latvia, with construction planned to begin in the middle of 2020.
 
UAB Windfarm Akmene One is expected to be commissioned after the middle of 2021. The construction of an additional 65 turbines totalling 325 MW, which will be the second phase of the complex, is seen to begin in the middle of 2021 and go live a year later.
 
Lithuania will hold its second renewables auction on May 29,  2020, targeting 700 GWh of annual power production.
