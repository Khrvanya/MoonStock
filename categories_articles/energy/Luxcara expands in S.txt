WindGerman renewables investor and asset manager Luxcara GmbH said today it has bought the 750-MW Oenusberget wind project in Sweden from German-Swedish developer Svevind, without disclosing the value of the deal.
The project is one of the largest single-site onshore wind schemes in Europe and is part of the Markbygden 1101 cluster. Luxcara said it purchased the asset for a portfolio of unnamed institutional investors. It anticipates that construction of the facility in Sweden's Norbotten county would begin this year, with commercial operations to be reached by end-2021. The wind farm will be selling its output under a power purchase agreement (PPA).
 
According to the statement, Svevind will continue to support the implementation of the project until grid-connection.
 
CMS Hasche Sigle Partnership von Rechtsanwalten und Steuerberatern mbB and law firm DLA Piper Sweden acted as Luxcara's legal advisors. Sveving, meanwhile, received legal counsel from Cirio Advokatbyra AB and Hogan Lovells LLP.
