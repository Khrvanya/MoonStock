NuclearA total of 14 power reactors will be shut down in order to reduce the share of nuclear in France's electricity generation mix from the current 75% to 50% by 2035, President Emmanuel Macron announced today.The 2012 election pledge by former French president Francois Hollande aimed to limit nuclear's share of French generation to 50% by 2025, and to close Fessenheim - the country's oldest plant - by the end of his five-year term, which ended in May last year. In June 2014, following a national energy debate, his government announced the country's nuclear generating capacity would be capped at the current level of 63.2 GWe. It will also be limited to 50% of France's total output by 2025. The French Energy Transition for Green Growth Law was adopted in August 2015. Nuclear currently accounts for almost 75% of the country's electricity production.
 
When he was elected, Macron promised to respect Hollande's target. However, he has said French reductions in nuclear power must be at a pace which allows the country to retain energy sovereignty.
 
France's two oldest reactors - units 1 and 2 at the Fessenheim plant in eastern France - will close in the spring of 2020, he said. Two further reactors will be shut down in 2025/2026, with two more following in 2027-2028. The remaining reactors would close by 2035. Macron said there would be no complete closure of any existing nuclear power plant site.
 
He also announced that support for renewables will increase from the current EUR5 billion to between EUR7 and EUR8 billion per year. Onshore wind capacity will be trebled and photovoltaic capacity increased five-fold by 2030. Offshore wind will also be developed.
