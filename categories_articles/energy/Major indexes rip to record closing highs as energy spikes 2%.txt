  U.S. equities closed higher on Monday, led by energy stocks, as  oil prices rose on renewed optimism that OPEC was closing in on a  deal to cut production."I don't know if it will happen, but the market certainly hopes that it will," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, referring to a possible OPEC deal.The three major indexes closed at record highs simultaneously for the first time since this past summer. The Dow Jones industrial average rose around 88 points, surpassing previous closing and intraday records of 18,923.06 and 18,934.05, respectively.The S&P 500 topped its all-time intraday high of 2,193.81, hit  on  Aug. 15, during midday trade and closed at a record high, as the energy sector gained 2.2 percent. The Nasdaq  composite advanced 0.89 percent, also posting records on a closing and intraday basis.  The Russell 2000 and the S&P Mid Cap 400  indexes, which track small and mid cap stocks, respectively, also  hit record highs.  "I think oil, and commodities in general, are leading the way for  stocks," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First  Standard Financial. He also said that crude prices received a  boost from a weaker dollar. U.S. crude for December delivery rose 3.9 percent  to settle at $47.49 per barrel. The U.S.  dollar  index, which surged 2.24 percent last week to its highest  level since 2003, traded 0.26 percent lower, around 100.9.  That said, Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and  derivatives at Charles Schwab, said he expects oil prices to hold  in a range roughly between $40 and $50 per barrel. "We've got  high supply and slow-growing demand," he said. "Any deal between  OPEC would be shaky, as we've seen."  There were no major economic reports due Monday. However, Federal  Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer delivered remarks  about how fiscal policy can help boost productivity and,  in turn, lower the burden of supporting the economy on the  central bank.  "Certain fiscal policies, particularly those that increase  productivity, can increase the potential of the economy and help  confront some of our longer-term economic challenges," Fischer  said.  The prospects of fiscal stimulus have risen sharply since Nov. 8,  when Republican Donald Trump stunned the world by winning the  U.S. presidential election. Investors and traders were quick to  adjust positions, shifting large amounts of assets into sectors  that would benefit from fiscal spending. They also piled into  financials on hopes for deregulation within the sector.  Since Nov. 8, U.S. equities have seen a surge into record or  near-record levels. But Stephen Wood, chief market  strategist at Russell Investments, said a number of factors prior  to the election primed the market to reach these levels. "We saw  improvement in the inflation data, jobs and wages data and those  factors sort of coalesced" with improving earnings, he said.  U.S. Treasurys, however, have taken a hit since the election,  with the benchmark 10-year note yield breaking above 2 percent  since then. On Monday, however, the 10-year note yield slipped to  around 2.33 percent.   "When you get a knee-jerk reaction, it's not surprising to see a  pullback," said Greg Woodard, portfolio strategist at Manning & Napier. "Having said that, there is a trend for higher fiscal stimulus around the world, and that is supportive of higher yields."  Later this week, which will be shortened by the Thanksgiving  holiday on Thursday, the Fed is scheduled to release the minutes  of its November meeting. That said, Schwab's Frederick said the  minutes are likely to have little impact on the market since the  odds of a rate hike next month are so high.  According to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, market  expectations for a December rate increase were more than 95  percent.   Frederick also said he expects stocks to trade in a sideways  pattern this week, given the holiday. "Traditionally, any holiday  week is usually a low-volume week," he said.  In corporate news, Tyson Foods shares plunged 14.49 percent, after the firm reported weaker-than-expected quarterly  results.  Overseas, European stocks mostly rose, with the pan-European  Stoxx 600 index gaining 0.25 percent. In Asia, stocks  closed mixed, with the Korean Kospi falling 0.43 percent and  the Shanghai composite gaining 0.79 percent.  The Dow Jones industrial average closed 88.76 points higher,  or 0.47 percent, at 18,956.69, with DuPont leading advancers  and 3M the biggest decliner.  The  gained 16.28 points, or 0.75 percent, to end  at 2,198.18, with energy leading 10 sectors higher and real  estate the only decliner.  The Nasdaq rose 47.35 points, or 0.89 percent, to close at  5,368.86.  About three stocks advanced for every decliner at the New York  Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 845.46 million and a  composite volume of 3.524 billion in at the close.  The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best  gauge of fear in the market, traded lower, near 12.4. Gold futures for December delivery rose $1.10 to settle  at $1,209.80 per ounce.
