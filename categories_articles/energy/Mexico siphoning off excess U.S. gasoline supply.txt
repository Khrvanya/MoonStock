  The U.S. has quietly been increasing exports of gasoline to record levels, and  that is one factor that could be helping reduce the nation's oil glut  on the margin.  Last week, the U.S. exported about 5.7 million barrels of  gasoline, possibly a record. The 811,000 barrels a day reported  is nearly twice the amount exported at the same time last year  and almost a third more than was exported a week earlier,  according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  The data was revealed in a weekly government oil and gasoline  inventory report. Crude futures temporarily rose after the report showed a surprise drawdown in U.S. oil  supplies of 553,000 barrels to 468.2 million barrels. Analysts  had expected a build in supply of more than 2 million barrels.
