NuclearSlovakia's new reactor Mochovce 3 has successfully completed hot testing. Owner Slovenske Elektrarne (SE) said the plant could be ready for fuel loading this summer, although it will then have to wait for regulatory approval which could take up to eight months.Mochovce 3 is 98.8% complete, SE said, the remainder of work being the process to test and prove its safety and operational systems to satisfy regulators to grant licences to proceed to operation.
 
Juraj Krasnansky, in charge of the work, said the results were twice the regulatory demand and this "demonstrated the strength and tightness of the containment and definitively refute the misleading and false claims of the Austrian antinuclear activists".
 
Earlier this month SE issued a strongly worded response to Austrian anti-nuclear group Global2000 who it accused of "scaremongering through reports about Mochovce" based on what it said were anonymous accusations that its containment was not safe enough due to seismic reinforcement work done on site.
 
The final verdict on the hot tests will be issued by the nuclear safety regulator after hearing official opinions from national authorities on public health, labour and fire and rescue.
