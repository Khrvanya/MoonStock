Natural GasA 120 km extension of the existing Ungheni-Iasi gas delivery network in Moldova is ready to begin construction.The project is expected to cost over EUR113 million with partial funding being provided by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank providing sovereign loans of EUR41m each to the Government of Moldova.
 
Considered of vital importance, this project will help make Moldova less energy dependent on Russia. Once the North Stream pipeline has been completed the delivery of gas from Russia is likely to become uncertain.
 
The Ungheni-Iasi pipeline currently transports gas from Romania from OMV Petrom, a subsidiary of the Austrian oil and gas group OMV, and has a maximum transportation capacity of 1.5 billion m3 of gas.
