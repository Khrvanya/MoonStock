 Saudi  Arabia's first foray into the international bond market  appears to be going well as the books get set to close on what  could be a $15-20 billion deal.  The debt offering is expected to debut this week and is a key part of  the kingdom's economic reform plan as it would give Saudi Arabia  a sovereign benchmark that would help it open its capital markets for  future offerings, such as corporate issues.  Saudi Arabian officials have been on a road show for the  multi-tranche dollar offering since last week, and they met with investors in New York on Tuesday. According to price  talk, the Saudi five-year note would tentatively come to market with  a yield 160 basis points above the U.S. five-year Treasury note. The  10-year would tentatively be set at 185 bps above the U.S.  10-year, and the 30-year would be 235 bps above the U.S. long  bond.
