Electricity MarketMontenegrin state-run power utility EPCG has dropped plans to build a second unit of Pljevlja thermal power plant, prime minister Dusko Markovic said."We have renounced the usage of a large coal mine in the Pljevlja area and the construction of another thermal power plant, although it is a great investment and brings many jobs. We said no, we will build something that is in the spirit of our economic policy, sustainable development and environmental protection," Markovic said in a video file posted on the YouTube channel of Montenegro's government earlier this week.
 
"Maybe in 50 or 100 years the future generations will invent some new technology to use coal in combination with biomass in a way that does not harm the environment," Markovic said at the Milocer Development Forum in Cetinje.
 
In December 2017, EPCG terminated its cooperation with Skoda Praha on the construction of a second unit of Pljevlja thermal power plant after failing to reach a technical and financial agreement with the Czech company. A year earlier EPCG had signed a 324.5 million euro ($358.3 million) contract with Skoda Praha for the construction of the 254 MW unit.
