Natural GasThe Dutch government declared it will halt gas production at the Groningen field, once Europe's biggest, by 2030 as it intends to reduce the risk caused by small but destructive earthquakes.Production is estimated at 21.6 billion cubic meters (bcm) this year, already lower than the peak of 53.8 bcm reached in 2013, following several cuts as decades of extraction have led to dozens of earthquakes every year, damaging thousands of households and buildings.

Mark Rutte, Dutch Prime Minister revealed in a press conference: "Our intention is (to cut production) to get towards 12 billion cubic meters in the coming four or five years, and to zero at the end of the coming decade."

Economy Minister Eric Wiebes told that the cuts will be accomplished partially by urging large industrial users to look for other sources of energy by 2022. Also, the Netherlands is constructing a conversion plant to produce high-calorific foreign gas appropriate for the use in Dutch systems.

Foreign consumers of Dutch gas in Germany and Belgium will be stimulated to look for other sources, and their contracts will not be renewed, while Dutch households will be encouraged to reduce gas usage and switch to non-gas heating systems.

Dutch wholesale prices at the TTF hub were slightly changed after the statement -- both the summer 2018 and winter 2018 contracts traded less than one-euro cent higher, settling at 18.23 euros per megawatt-hour (MWh) and 19.02 euros/MWh respectively.

The government declared last month that it intended to reduce production at the field from existing levels of 21.6 bcm per year to 12 bcm as fast as possible, after nation's northern region was affected by the heaviest earthquake in years in January.
