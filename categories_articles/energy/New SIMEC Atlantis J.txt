RenewableSIMEC Atlantis Energy Ltd today shared its plans to build up to 2 GW of tidal energy capacity in Normandie, France, through a newly-created joint venture.The company, formerly known as Atlantis Resources, has entered into a JV agreement with the Development Agency for Normandy, also known as AD Normandy, and regional investment fund Normandie Participations to co-develop a tidal stream project in the hundreds of megawatts in Raz Blanchard.
 
The target is to commence construction work on a large-scale project in 2021 and have a full multi-hundred-megawatt array operational by 2024.
 
If all goes as planned, Normandie Hydrolienne will eventually be harnessing up to 2 GW of power from the Alderney Race, the eight-mile strait that runs between Alderney and La Hague, and will have over 1 GW of resource from adjacent concessions under the control of the States of Alderney.
 
"Our techno-economic feasibility study plans for the delivery of an initial 1 GW of operational capacity by 2025, which could be quickly expanded to 2 GW by 2027, at a Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) competitive with offshore wind farms currently in construction in France," said Tim Cornelius, CEO of SIMEC Atlantis.
