CO2New regulations to make road and air transport more ecologically-friendly have been announced in the UK.The recent Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) came into force last night and it will require fuel firms to more than double the quantity of renewable fuel they provide by 2020.

The production of innovative fuels from waste, comprising hard-to-decarbonise sectors such as the aviation industry, will also be incentivised.

At present, the transport sector is the biggest contributor of greenhouse gases in the country.

The RTFO backs fuels counting bioethanol and biodiesel, as well as gases such as biomethane and renewable hydrogen.

According to Dr Nina Skorupska, CEO of the Renewable Energy Association, this is an exciting time for renewable transport. She added that these new regulations will fire the starting gun on the UK's development of innovative fuels for aviation and other forms of transport which are hard to decarbonise and develop their leadership position in the production of renewable fuels for road transport.
