  Oil prices fell as much as 5 percent Tuesday after Saudi Oil Minister Ali  Al-Naimi said that producers may meet in March on an output  freeze, but that crude production cuts will not happen. Saudi Arabia,  Russia, Qatar and Venezuela proposed last week a production  freeze at January levels in response to the global glut and  sustained low prices of crude.  Still, keeping production where it is will encourage continued  volatility in oil prices, Jeffrey Currie, global head of  commodities research at Goldman Sachs,  told CNBC's "Fast Money Halftime Report" on Tuesday.  "I think what we're seeing in terms of price action today is  exactly what we are going to be seeing going forward," said  Currie. "It's going to be a trendless market with volatility  between $20 and $40 a barrel."  Oil prices had surged on the prospect of OPEC and noncartel members capping production, but the rally stalled on Tuesday on  doubts that a freeze would significantly reduce oversupply.  On Monday, OPEC Secretary General Abdalla Salem El-Badri told  CNBC that oil producers are still "feeling the water" over a  possible deal to freeze production, and that it is "wait and see" as  to whether it leads to any other type of accord.  Naimi said there is more to unite energy industry participants  than to divide them, but lack of consensus led OPEC to embark on  a policy that has sent prices spiraling.Keeping output at record levels also does not help stabilize oil prices, Currie added. "If you look at Russia, the numbers we have for their January production is the highest they will get in all of 2016 to begin with," Currie said. "In terms of thinking about this 'freeze,' it doesn't do anything to the fundamentals."— CNBC's Tom DiChristopher contributed to this report.
