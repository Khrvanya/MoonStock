Natural GasSlovakia and other CEE countries militate against the Nord Stream 2, considering it as a violation of the diversification principle and posing another risk for Ukraine.Germany's maritime authority BSH declared in late March that it had greenlighted the construction of the 31-km segment of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline passing via its waters, since it revealed that there is no danger to shipping or the environment. This signifies that the building of the controversial pipeline avoiding traditional routes for conveying Russian gas to Europe through Ukraine is closer. But the project still requires permission from other nations.

The construction of the Nord Stream 2 could signify changing paths in central Europe, including Slovakia, through which Russian gas goes to Europe.

The Nord Stream 2 by Russia's gas export giant Gazprom should be 1,225 km long, directly linking Germany and Russia under the Baltic Sea. Its yearly capacity would be 55 billion cubic meters.

Consequently, it would double Russia's capacity to transport gas across the Baltic Sea to Germany and beyond to 110 billion cubic meters per year. The target is to make the pipeline with a price tag of EUR9.5 billion functional in 2020.
