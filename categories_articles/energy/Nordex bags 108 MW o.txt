WindGermany's Nordex has received orders to deliver 108 MW of wind turbines for several projects in Greece, the manufacturer said today.The contracts were awarded by Greek renewable power producer Terna Energy, which has ordered 36 Nordex turbines of different models. In addition to supplying the equipment, the German manufacturer will also service the machines under a five-year premium service contract, which can be extended for an additional five years.
 
Nordex noted its new sales office in Athens, which was opened last summer, is allowing it to react directly to customer demands and handle Greek projects more efficiently.
 
As of end-September 2018, Terna Energy had 986 MW of installed renewable energy capacity, in Greece, the US and southeastern Europe. The bulk of that capacity, or 561 MW, is located at home. The Greek firm is currently building or has shovel-ready projects totalling 301 MW, both in Greece and abroad, the press release says.
