Oil MarketNorway's Equinor SA on Tuesday said it plans to explore for oil in deep waters off the coast of South Australia in late 2020 and released a draft environmental assessment for the project to head off community protests.Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, took full control of two permits in the Great Australian Bight, a body of water off the southern Australian coast, in 2017, where BP had scrapped plans to explore for oil. Chevron Corp also gave up its holdings in the Bight that year at a time when oil majors were slashing exploration spending.
 
Equinor said in a press release that it is seeking comments on its draft environmental plan over the next month. It said it would take into account comments before submitting the plan to Australia's offshore regulator.
 
Equinor plans to drill the Stromlo-1 exploration well in the Bight, 372 km (223 miles) from the nearest point on the Australian coast and in water depths of 2,239 meters (7,345 feet), it said in the plan.
