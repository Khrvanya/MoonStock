  Oil prices will remain below the psychologically important  $100-a-barrel mark until at least 2025, according to a draft  report by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  (OPEC), seen by The Wall Street Journal.  In its most optimistic scenario, OPEC, which represents 12  oil-producing countries, forecast that oil will sell for around  $76 per barrel in 10 years' time, according to the report.  However, it warned that crude oil could cost as little as $40 per  barrel in 2025.   "$100 is not in any of the scenarios," said a delegate at an OPEC  presentation last week in Vienna, according to The Wall  Street Journal. OPEC has refused to cut its output following a 60 percent crash  in oil prices that began in June last year. Brent and WTI crude  prices have partially recovered from the lows seen at the start  of 2015 to trade at around $65 and $59 per barrel  respectively.   The draft report seen by the newspaper recommended that OPEC  reintroduce the quota system it largely abandoned in 2011, which  limited how much oil each member country could produce.
