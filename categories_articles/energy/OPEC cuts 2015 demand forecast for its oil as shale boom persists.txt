  Global demand for oil from OPEC next year will be less  than expected because of weaker growth in consumption  and the U.S. shale boom, the group said on  Wednesday, pointing to an increasing supply  surplus in 2015. In a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum  Exporting Countries (OPEC) forecast demand for  the group's oil will drop to 28.92 million  barrels per day (bpd) in 2015, down 280,000 bpd from  its previous expectation. Brent crude oil slipped below $66  a barrel on Wednesday, just above a five-year low, after the  report was out.   The report follows OPEC's decision last month not to cut output  despite plunging prices, as top exporter Saudi Arabia urged  fellow members to combat the U.S. shale oil boom which has  been eroding OPEC's market share.  The price of the North Sea oil benchmark has fallen more than 40  percent since June as new supplies of high-quality crude from  North America have fed a glut in many parts of the world.    "There is a growing realisation that the first half  of next year is going to look very weak," said Gareth  Lewis-Davies, strategist at BNP Paribas. "You start to price that  in now."

The contract hit $65.29 on Tuesday, its lowest since  September 2009.  U.S. crude futures were  down $1.12 at $62.70 a barrel.        Data from the American Petroleum Institute  (API) on Tuesday showed U.S. crude oil inventories rose by 4.4  million barrels last week to 377.4 million barrels, compared with  analysts' expectations of a drop of 2.2 million.

"Almost all the news flow points to a weaker  market," said Carsten Fritsch, oil analyst at Commerzbank in  Frankfurt.       "We have had very bearish API data with large stock  builds across the board, and also a very bearish Short-Term  Energy Outlook from the EIA, with a sharp reduction in demand  growth forecasts for next year."       The U.S. Energy Information Administration cut its  global oil demand growth estimate for 2015 by 240,000 barrels per  day (bpd) to 880,000 bpd. It forecast oil demand growth this year  would be around 960,000 bpd.

The cartel may still hold an  emergency meeting before its June gathering, Algeria's energy  minister said on Tuesday.       Italian oil and energy group Eni said OPEC may cut output in the spring and  that oil prices will remain between $66 and $75 per barrel next  year.
