  An agreement by OPEC to work toward a production cut could halt a  bigger price decline and points to the strain low crude prices  have had on producers, including the largest exporter, Saudi  Arabia.  OPEC struggled to reach the deal, just as oil prices were set to  head lower, due to reduced demand from the refining industry. Each year, during the switch over to winter fuel production, industry demand drops as refineries undergo maintenance. That  is known as the "shoulder season," and the market had been  bracing for another decline in prices during it.  OPEC's surprise ability to take action also helped boost the  organization's relevance again, after it had been written off by  many market players. Oil prices immediately  surged more than 5 percent Wednesday  after Reuters reported from Algeria that OPEC  members agreed to cut output for the first time since 2008. West Texas Intermediate was trading at just about the same level Thursday, close to $47 per barrel.  Without a deal, analysts had said oil could plunge to $40 or  lower.   "I think the price will wobble, but it certainly keeps more  support than walking away with nothing. What I think is this will  be a process. This isn't even an official OPEC meeting, and it  buys them time," said Daniel Yergin, Vice Chairman of IHS. "It's  them negotiating to negotiate."
