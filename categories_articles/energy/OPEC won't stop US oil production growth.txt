  U.S. oil production could increase next year to levels not seen  since the 1970s, despite OPEC's efforts to muscle out American  shale producers.  While U.S. oil production is predicted to rise by another million  barrels a day during 2015 from the current 9 million barrels a  day, forecasts are coming down on expectations that OPEC's unwillingness to cut production will keep a  lid on prices well into next year. Lower prices limit new  drilling and hit high-cost wells first.  Saudi Arabia may continue to stay away from cuts even if prices  continue to move lower: OPEC's biggest producer now expects Brent  crude to stabilize at around $60 a barrel, which is a level the  Saudis could withstand, according to a Dow Jones report.  But analysts say the U.S. industry, which has turned around its  fortunes with new technologies in less than a decade, is expected  to drill the most-efficient wells, and production will continue  to grow—even with lower prices. There is also a gusher of  new offshore oil production coming online in the Gulf of Mexico.
