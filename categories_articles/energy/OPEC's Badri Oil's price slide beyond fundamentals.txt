  The head of OPEC said on Sunday the group had no target price for  oil, and urged Gulf states to continue investing in exploration  and production, saying the United States would continue to rely  on Middle East crude for many years.  But Abdullah al-Badri acknowledged that the oil price, which has  dominated trade on global financial markets in recent days as it  hit a succession of five-year lows, had fallen further than  market fundamentals should have dictated.

All of this is incorrect. Some also say it was  directed at Iran. And Russia. This also is incorrect," he said.Read More  Oil will 'absolutely' continue to fall: Dennis Gartman  Brent crude settled at below $62 a barrel on Friday after the  world energy watchdog forecast even lower prices on weaker demand  and larger supplies next year.
