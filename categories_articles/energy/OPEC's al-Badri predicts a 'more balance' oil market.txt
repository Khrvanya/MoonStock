  The oil market is expected to become more balanced in 2016 as  demand continues to grow, OPEC Secretary-General Abdullah  al-Badri said  ahead of the producer group's policy  meeting next month.  "The expectation is that the market will return to more balance  in 2016," he said in a speech at an Asian ministerial energy  roundtable in the Qatari capital Doha on Monday.  "We see global oil demand maintaining its recent healthy growth.  We see less non-OPEC supply. And we see an increase in the demand  for OPEC crude," al-Badri said, according to the text of the speech  published on the OPEC website.  Most of the oil supply increases in recent years have come from  high-cost production, al-Badri said, in a clear reference to supply  sources such as U.S. shale oil. "The market is now taking on board this new reality and gradually  resetting itself, as we can see with falling non-OPEC supply  growth and stronger demand," he said.  The Organization of  the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which decided late last  year to focus on maintaining market share instead of propping up  oil prices, holds its next policy-setting meeting at its Vienna  headquarters on Dec. 4.Read MoreChina's voracious oil appetite to help balance OPEC output  Saudi Arabia's vice oil minister said on Monday that long-term  oil market fundamentals remain robust but prolonged low prices  could threaten security of supply and pave the way for  a price spike.  The comments from Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman suggest the OPEC  heavyweight is satisfied with its strategy of not cutting  production and allowing low prices to reduce supplies.  Brent crude was trading at $47.64 a barrel at 0908 GMT, compared  with levels around $115 in June last year.
