Electricity MarketThe Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Catapult is looking for a collaboration with a UK university to create a new research hub. The projected center would combine academic and industry skills to hasten electrical infrastructure research and expansion activities linked to offshore green energy technologies.Last year, ORE Catapult  and the University of Bristol successfully established Wind Blade Research Hub. Now it is looking forward to open an Electrical Infrastructures Hub that will attract a five-year funding estimated at PS700,000 from ORE Catapult. 

It will be instituted with the aim to develop component reliability and availability, system optimization and smart energy and storage solutions.

Paul McKeever, ORE Catapult's Head of Strategic Research, affirmed: "With the cost of offshore wind turbine technology tumbling, it is important to maximise these benefits by also considering the wider electrical infrastructure solution. How we convert, transmit and store energy from our offshore renewable assets in an effective and reliable manner is one of the biggest challenges that lie ahead."
