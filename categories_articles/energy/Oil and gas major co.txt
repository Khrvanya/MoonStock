Oil MarketA $1 billion (PS0.7billion) foundation instituted by oil and gas giants to overcome climate change has announced its first three investment projects.The OGCI (The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative) consists of 10 firms including BP, CNPC, Shell, Statoil and Total. Its investment partner, OGCI Climate Investments, is backing US company Solidia Technologies to make cement with carbon dioxide rather than water, expecting to lessen emissions by 70% and water use by 80%.

Another US firm called Achates Power, which produces vehicle engines that diffuse less greenhouse gas emissions, is receiving funding to expand its technology worldwide. A project that targets to design a full-scale gas power plant with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is also being endorsed by OGCI.

The fund is created within a collaboration between UN Environment and the Environmental Defense Fund to offer monetary and technical funding for the first global methane study to complete the knowledge related to the identification and quantification of global methane emissions. It will also co-work with Imperial College London in the field of research that wishes to provide a more precise image of greenhouse gas emissions across the natural gas value chain, from source to distribution.

Erik Solheim, Executive Director of UN Environment affirmed: "Oil and gas industry leaders have a critical role to play in our efforts to take on climate change and limit the global temperature rise. We are counting on groups such as OGCI to support the needed shift in the way we produce and consume energy.

He further declared that partnerships like that are crucial, and these are not only about financial aid but real action, as it represents the estimation of success.
