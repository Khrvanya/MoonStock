  U.S. oil prices are heading into a sweet spot that could spur the  fracking industry to crank up some of the drilling it shut down  when crude prices collapsed.  West Texas Intermediate oil futures for June rose above $60 per barrel Tuesday for  the first time since December. That sparked expectations the  price could go even higher, if U.S. oil inventory data Wednesday  show an expected draw down in oil stored at the Nymex physical  hub in Cushing, Oklahoma."If oil prices stabilize above $60, I believe we are going to  resume production growth in the second half of the year. More  companies will drill more wells," said Fadel Gheit, senior energy  analyst at Oppenheimer.
