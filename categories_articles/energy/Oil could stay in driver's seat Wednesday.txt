  Stock traders will be looking over their shoulders at energy  markets Wednesday, after two days of whiplash from falling oil  prices.  Oil could again be volatile, particularly with 10:30 a.m. ET  release of petroleum inventory data expected from the Energy  Information Administration. American Petroleum Institute  data, released after Tuesday's market close, showed a surprise  drawdown in supply, driving oil futures slightly higher in late  trading.  The Dow fell 162 points Tuesday to 17,568, and the S&P 500  was 13 points lower Tuesday, at 2,063.
