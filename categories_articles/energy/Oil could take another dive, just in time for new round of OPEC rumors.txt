  The next trough in oil prices could come just as OPEC members  gather in Algeria next month — and that could make for an  interesting, and more unpredictable outcome.  While most analysts say OPEC members are all talk, and no action, some say  there is an outside chance members could feel pressured enough to  act if crude prices are in free fall.    Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  have said they would discuss at their late September meeting whether a freeze or some other action is needed to stabilize oil  prices, after a number of  high-profile failures to reach an agreement.
