  Oil prices surged nearly 9 percent Monday, capping a three-day  rally in which the commodity rose a total of more than 27 percent, after  U.S. oil production data showed output falling and OPEC said it  would talk with other producers about low prices.

The spread between the two benchmarks widened to more than $5  intraday after narrowing to $4.33.

Since November, OPEC countries led by  Saudi Arabia have kept production high to maintain market share,  even as prices have plummeted.
