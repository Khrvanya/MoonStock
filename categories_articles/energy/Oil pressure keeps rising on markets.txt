  Markets could again be buffeted by year-end crosscurrents and  positioning ahead of the Fed, but oil may have the final say  Thursday.  There are just a few data releases Thursday, including initial  claims and import prices at 8:30 a.m. ET. The federal  budget is released at 2 p.m. At 10:30 a.m. the  government releases supply data on natural gas, down 5.5  percent so far this week on warm weather. There is a $13  billion 30-year bond auction at 1 p.m.   "Oil is calling the tune, but the selling is very, very broad,"  said Art Cashin, director of floor operations at the NYSE for UBS. "The  financials are down, and a whole variety of things. If it weren't  for the two merger guys in the Dow (DuPont and Dow) the Dow would  be down a lot more too."
