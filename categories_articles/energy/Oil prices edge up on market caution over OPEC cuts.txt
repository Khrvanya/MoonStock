 Oil prices are edging up in Asia on Monday after the  Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said it  was near its target of cutting 1.8 million barrels  of crude oil a day, two months after committing to the  deal.   Early in Asia, benchmark U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude  oil futures were 0.1 percent higher at $53.27 a barrel while  international benchmark Brent crude oil futures were also up  0.1 percent at $55.53 a barrel, reflecting caution even after the OPEC  statement.  Vanda Insights founder Vandana Hari told CNBC's The  Rundown said it was still early days at just a fortnight after the implementation of the cuts. A better gauge of their impact would be the full production and  export data for January.   Hari's comments came as U.S. energy companies last week  added the most rigs drilling for new production in almost four  years, energy services firm Baker Hughes data showed on Friday.  Drillers added 29 rigs in the week to January 20, bringing the  total count up to 551, the most since November 2015, it  said. U.S. oil production has risen over 6 percent since  mid-2016. Even though they are 7 percent below their historic  2015 peak, they are back to levels of late 2014 amid the crash in  oil prices that started in the summer of the same year, according  to Reuters data.  "Shale remains a very real danger in terms of its  resurgence and what that does to OPEC's plan to keep  prices in the $50-$60 a barrel band," said Hari.Oil prices have risen about 20 percent since OPEC  committed to an output cut but most of it has been  sentiment-driven, a CNBC survey of strategists and forecasters  showed as respondents warned of a stall in a the price rally should  producers not deliver on the pledged supply cuts.
