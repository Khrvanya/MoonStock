  Oil prices pared some of their losses on Wednesday after falling to  near seven-year lows earlier in the week, but those hoping for a  rebound next year may be disappointed.   Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy  Agency (IEA), told CNBC that crude prices could continue to fall  in 2016, presenting a challenge to governments that are trying to  encourage the use of relatively expensive sustainable  energy.   "When we look at 2016, I don't see many reasons why we can see  upward pressure on the prices… Demand is weaker and we may  well see Iran come back (to the market) and there will be a lot  of oil," Birol said, talking from the sidelines of the COP21  climate conference in Paris.  "So 2016 may well be another year with lower prices and this will  have implications of course for investments in the oil  sector."   Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices fell  below $40 per barrel this week for the first time since early  2009. Both types of oil rallied on Wednesday, but WTI prices  remained below $40, trading at just over $38. Brent traded at  around $40.75 per barrel.   Oil prices have tumbled since June last year due to supply and  demand imbalances. U.S. shale gas production has risen and OPEC  has maintained output, while demand from China, a massive  consumer of commodities, has waned.   This week's renewed slump was precipitated when OPEC once again  failed to cut production quotas, after meeting last Friday.  Birol said that IEA estimates indicated that investment in the  oil industry fell by more by 20 percent in 2015 – the  steepest decline in history. A further decline is seen in  2016.   "We have never seen in the last 30 years, oil investment  declining for two years in a row and this will have consequences  for the markets in the next few years to come," he told  CNBC.  — Follow CNBC International  on Twitter and Facebook.
