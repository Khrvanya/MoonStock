Tropical storms and Hurricane Hermine combined to slow the  movement of oil tankers and shut in offshore drilling, forcing  the U.S. oil industry to dip into its massive oversupply at the  highest rate for this time of year.  In the past week, the industry used 14.5 million barrels in  storage, largely from the East Coast and Gulf Coast, according to  government data.  Analysts blamed wind and rough seas  resulting from Gaston, Hermine and other storms that have impeded  ships with cargoes headed for U.S. refineries.As a result, there was also a sharp decline of 1.8 million  barrels a day in U.S. imports — oil that comes from places  like Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. Gasoline stocks also fell by 4.2  million barrels. While the storms threatened the Gulf of  Mexico, 12 percent of U.S. oil drilling in the Gulf was  temporarily shut in.
