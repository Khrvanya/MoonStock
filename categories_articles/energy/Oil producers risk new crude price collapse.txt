  Producing nations risk an oil bust if they don't reach a freeze  agreement of some sort when they meet in Doha, Qatar, this weekend.  Market expectations are high and rising for a deal, and crude  futures have been climbing as a result, but an accord that would  halt production growth will be difficult to reach and difficult  to keep. Even if there is an agreement among OPEC and non-OPEC producers, capping production would still leave a glut of  oil on the world market.Oil saw its latest pop after Russia's representative to OPEC was  quoted by Interfax on Tuesday saying that Russia hopes to reach a  deal even though there are disagreements between Saudi Arabia and  Iran. West Texas Intermediate futures settled at $42.17 per  barrel, their highest close since November. Brent rose close to $45  per barrel.  "I think with all the countries gathering, if there is not an  agreement, prices will fall sharply and for each of them, it  means new pain in their budget. It will hurt them a lot," said  Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS. "Being able to sustain  prices convincingly above $40 is very much in their  interest."
