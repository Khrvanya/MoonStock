  Talks between major oil producers about freezing output shows how  painful cheap crude has become, but it is not likely to bring an  end to the world oil glut anytime soon.  Analysts caution that the situation is fluid and the outcome  still very uncertain, particularly since Iran has not seemed to  have definitively agreed to anything. That country has been the wild card  for the oil industry, since it is bringing crude back to the  already oversupplied market now that sanctions against its  nuclear program have been lifted.  "This is a selling opportunity ...  think what the market is rewarding is they had a meeting and  it was civil. They all said the right thing. This is a potential  first step. If they agree on this, will they agree on a  production cut? They need to," said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital.
