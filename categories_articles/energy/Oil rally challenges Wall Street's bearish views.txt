  Wall Street's bearish views that oil could crater in the  next couple of weeks is being challenged as crude futures bounce  off 2015 highs and are now up 17 percent this month.  West Texas Intermediate futures for May surged more than 5 percent Wednesday after U.S. government inventory data showed the  smallest rise in oil stockpiles this year, a drop in gasoline  inventories and a slight fall in U.S. oil production. Even so,  distillate product supplies rose, but the 1.3 million barrel  increase in oil inventories was the smallest build since Jan. 2  and was well below the 4.1 million expected by analysts.   "I think what we're seeing here is there's a big segment of the  market that is saying: 'Prices have bottomed and we are going to  see output growth weaken and that's going to lead to a turnaround  in prices.'" said Gene McGillian, an oil analyst at Tradition  Energy. "That's why we're watching as we get above the February  highs, we want to see if big volume floods the market."
