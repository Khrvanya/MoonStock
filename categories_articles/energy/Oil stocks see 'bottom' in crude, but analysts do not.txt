  Oil stocks bounced, in their best day in three years, but oil  industry analysts say the equities may be premature in celebrating a bottom in  oil prices.  "I think it's too early to call that," said John Kilduff of Again  Capital. "All the elements are in place that got us to these new  lows. We've had episodes of backing and filling and working off  some of those oversold conditions. I think the Russian situation  was a disrupting event and oil was acting bad because of it. OPEC  is on the wires every day saying they don't care how low it goes,  they're not going to cut back."West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 54 cents to settle at $56.47 per barrel, while the S&P energy industry sector jumped 4.2 percent. Brent crude futures settled up 1.9 percent at $61.18 per barrel.
