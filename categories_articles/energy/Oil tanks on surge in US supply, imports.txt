  Oil futures plunged Wednesday on a government report showing a  surge in supplies of U.S. oil and a record level of gasoline  production.  The U.S. is awash in oil, with  record levels of production meeting a rising tide of imports. The  U.S. Department of Energy said oil stocks rose by 7.26 million  barrels, while analysts had expected a decline of 1.8  million barrels. West Texas Intermediate futures for February, already sliding, took another leg  lower after the report, which also showed a 4.1 million barrel  build in gasoline, more than six times the expected amount. WTI  was off more than 3 percent to $55.40 per barrel, and Brent slid  once more below $60 a barrel. Read MoreOil at $90-$100 in  2015: Pickens
