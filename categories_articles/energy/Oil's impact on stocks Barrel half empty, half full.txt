  Crude's decline to five-year lows is clearly not a good thing for  the energy sector, which is down nearly 13 percent this year. But one sector's loss in  this case is another's gain, and many stand to gain from American  consumers having more money in their pockets, especially during  the holiday shopping season.  "As energy and materials are dropping, the other 80 percent of  the S&P 500 benefit, but if it drops too far, it could  develop into a scenario where the job creation and high-paying  jobs in the energy patch shut down. But in the near term,  consumers are getting a break here. It's a big tax cut for most  people," said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist for RW  Baird & Co.  "The only thing we're going to talk about this week and for the  rest of this year is the price of a barrel of oil and how low it  can go. AAA is talking about the national average of  gasoline hitting $2.50 a gallon before the end of the year,  that's a dollar less than it was a year ago," said Art Hogan,  chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities.
