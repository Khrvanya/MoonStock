WindThe 1 billion pounds Walney facility already had 102 turbines before the completion of a further 87 earlier this year - dubbed the Walney Extension.Each turbine stands 623ft (190m) high, with the wind farm covering an area of 55 sq miles (145 sq km).
 
It will be able to generate enough power for 600,000 homes.
 
Sitting in the Irish Sea 12 miles (19km) off Barrow-in-Furness, the wind farm overtakes the current largest operational facility, London Array, in the Thames Estuary.
 
Danish owner Orsted began onshore construction of the project in 2015.
 
About 250 people will be employed in the operation and maintenance of the wind farm.
 
The turbine blades were manufactured in Hull and the Isle of Wight.
 
Orsted has pledged a Community Benefit Fund worth up to PS600,000 for each of the wind farm's 25-year expected lifespan.
 
It will support community and environmental projects in coastal areas of Cumbria and Lancashire.
