WindOrsted is to acquire US renewables developer Lincoln Clean Energy for about $580m, signalling a move into the onshore wind sector for the Danish energy company.Lincoln Clean Energy has wind farms totalling 513MW operational, a further 300MW under construction and a pipeline of over 1.5GW to be completed by 2022. Its portfolio also includes 10MW of solar power.
 
The existing management team will continue to run Lincoln Clean Energy, which will be a separate unit outside of Orsted's wind power business.
 
The transaction is subject to approval by the US competition authorities and is expected to close by the end of 2018.
 
Meanwhile, Orsted earnings in the first half of 2018 grew 11% to Dkr8.6bn (EUR1.3bn), compared with Dkr7.7bn in the same period in 2017.
 
The company said the increase was partly down to a strong showing in its wind power business.
 
Revenue from wind was up 34% to Dkr14.55bn from just over Dkr10.88bn in 2017. The company said power price increases in the UK helped boost the figures, as well as new subsidised wind farms in the UK and new O&M agreements.
 
Renewable generation accounted for 71% of the company's output in the first six months of 2018, up from 59% in 2017, Orsted said. This was driven by the ramp up of generation from the Race Bank and Walney 3 offshore wind farms.
 
Orsted said it expects to divest 50% of the 1.2GW Hornsea 1 offshore wind farm off the UK east coast during the second half of the year.
