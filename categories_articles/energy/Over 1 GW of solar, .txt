RenewableGermany received bids for 527 MW of onshore wind projects and 493 MW of solar photovoltaic (PV) proposals in its latest technology-specific procurement rounds.The Federal Network Agency, also known as the Bundesnetzagetur (BNetzA), announced on Wednesday that the onshore wind tender ended with 66 accepted bids with a combined capacity of 523 MW. Unlike the previous tender in December, which was slightly oversubscribed, this one failed to attract enough bids to meet the target of 900 MW.
 
The competitive round, held on February 1, will make possible the construction of 103 MW of wind farms in Schleswig-Holstein, 97 MW in North Rhine-Westphalia, 56 MW each in Thuringia and Lower Saxony and 59 MW in Brandenburg. The bid prices ranged between EUR 0.0576 (USD 0.0622) per kWh and EUR 0.062 per kWh, with the average surcharge coming at EUR 0.0618/kWh.
 
The solar tender, as usual, was significantly oversubscribed, luring 98 proposals of 493 MW in total, against a target of 100 MW. The awarded capacity was 100.55 MW, coming from 18 projects, the bulk of which in Bavaria.
 
The agency will hold the next technology-specific tenders on March 1, 2020.
