Oil MarketAccording to Oil & Gas UK and Decom North Sea, more than 200 oil and gas rigs as well as 2,500 wells across the basin are planned to be closed by 2025 year. The groups mention that the decommissioning will be applied to a total of 349 fields across the region, counting six on the Danish Continental Shelf, 23 units located on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, 106 situated on the Dutch Continental Shelf and 214 on the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS). Approximately 7,800 kilometers of pipeline is also likely to be closed.

An amount of PS17 billion is predicted for decommissioning of the UKCS until 2025, as the annual costs might attain up to PS2 billion per year compared with the forecasted PS800 million expenditure for exiting both the Norwegian Continental Shelf and the Dutch Continental Shelf units.

Around 46% of the total UKCS phasing out expenses over the period will be focused in the central North Sea, estimated at nearly PS7.9 billion. The most extensive category of expenditure is well plugging and abandonment, representing 49% of the overall cost of PS8.3 billion.

Mike Tholen, Oil & Gas UK's Upstream Policy Director, declared: "With industry driving efficiency improvements which have led to a 16% increase in UKCS production following a decade of decline, the sector is successfully controlling the cost of well plugging and abandonment."
