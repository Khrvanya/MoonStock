LNGPolish Oil and Gas Company (PGNiG) has signed a supply deal with Houston-based Cheniere for the delivery of more US LNG to the President Lech Kaczynski LNG Terminal in Swinoujscie.
LNG cargoes will be supplied on a delivered ex-ship basis over a 24-year period starting in 2019, PGNiG said in its statement.

In 2019-2022 the volume of supplies will total approximately 0.52 million tonnes of LNG, or approx. 0.7 bcm of natural gas after regasification, while in the period of 2023-2042, the total import volume will reach 29 million tonnes of LNG, which equals approx. 39 bcm of natural gas following regasification.

It means that starting from 2023 every year PGNiG will purchase about 1.45 million tonnes of LNG, which equals approx. 1.95 bcm of natural gas after regasification, the company said.

LNG cargoes from Cheniere heading for Poland will depart from liquefaction facilities in Sabine Pass, Louisiana and Corpus Christi, Texas.

The deal extends PGNiG's US LNG supply portfolio and follows 20-year agreements with Venture Global for the delivery of approximately 1 mtpa from its Calcasieu Pass and Plaquemines projects to be located on the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi River, respectively.
