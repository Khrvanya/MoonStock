RenewableMore divestments from coal and other fossil fuels assets will take place on the global scale, as countries implement the Paris climate deal.A recent study considers that divestment process will overcome the "green paradox", which is the phenomenon of a provisory increase in carbon emissions in reaction to climate policies meant to reduce emissions, if significant carbon prices are announced.
 
The implementation of the Paris agreement can generate opposite reactions from investors and fossil fuel owners. It considers that total CO2 emissions would be diminished. 

For example, the anticipation of strong carbon decommissioning policies might increase emissions as fossil fuels operators hasten to maximise revenues before new legal framework is implemented. 

At the same time, investors may not fund coal and other fossil fuel projects to avoid backing potentially exceeded assets.

Nico Bauer, Lead Author from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research affirmed: "We find that 10 years before carbon pricing policies are actually introduced, investors start pulling their money out of the coal power sector. They shy away from investing in fossil-fuelled power plants as they realise that the lifetime during which these plants will make money will be curtailed by the future climate policy."
