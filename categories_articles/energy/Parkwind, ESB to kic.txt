WindBelgian offshore wind developer Parkwind NV and Irish utility ESB have agreed to collaborate on two offshore wind projects off the Irish coast, having a combined capacity of 830 MW.ESB said on Tuesday it will acquire up to 35% of Parkwind's up to 330-MW Oriel wind project in the North Irish Sea off the coast of Dundalk, which is planned for commissioning in the early 2020s. The facility is expected to have an output that will be enough to supply around 280,000 homes, saving 600,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions annually.
 
Parkwind, in turn, will buy up to 35% of ESB's Clogherhead project off Ireland's East Coast, planned to have a capacity of 500 MW. The Irish energy group has a foreshore licence to commence site investigations for the project.
 
"Parkwind is continuously looking for strategic partnerships when developing projects. This partnership is driven by the strategy of the company which is based on a long-term vision whereby we not only develop, but also operate our projects," said Parkwind's co-CEO Francois Van Leeuw.
