This MOU, signed on the sidelines of Russian President Vladimir Putin's state visit to Singapore, called on the Temasek-backed LNG player to evaluate participation in and offtake from Novatek's Arctic LNG 2 project.
 
The two partners will also look at collaboration in LNG supply, trading and optimisation. They will review joint investments and capacity leasing arrangements for LNG carriers, storage, reload and transshipment facilities.
