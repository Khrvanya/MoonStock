NuclearPoland expects its first nuclear power plant to start operating after 2030 as the country aims to cut its use of coal in producing electricity, Deputy Environment Minister Michal Kurtyka said.The east European country, which hosts global climate talks in December, generates around 80 percent of its electricity from coal in outdated power plants, many of which will have to close in the coming decade.
 
Poland has considered building a nuclear power plant for years, but has yet to take a binding decision on the project.
 
"The discussion over launching the nuclear power plant has accelerated. It is mostly about the international partnership. We are able to finance the construction on our own, but we have to draw the technology from somewhere," Kurtyka told Reuters.
 
He added Poland would talk with France, the United States, Japan and South Korea about nuclear technologies.
