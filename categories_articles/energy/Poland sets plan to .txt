LNGPoland is planning to install an LNG floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) in the Bay of Gdansk by 2024-25 to meet growing Polish and regional gas demand, Piotr Naimski, the government's adviser on strategic energy infrastructure projects, said Wednesday.Poland is diversifying its gas suppliers to end its decades-old dependence on Russian pipeline gas, with the new FSRU also set to give Poland the opportunity to become a gateway for gas supplies in the region in the middle of the next decade.
 
Warsaw estimates Polish gas demand will rise by up to 4 Bcm/year from around 18 Bcm this year to 21-22 Bcm in 2023-24.
 
The government plans to meet that demand by purchasing Norwegian gas through the 10 Bcm/year Baltic Pipe project, with an additional 4 Bcm/year set to come from domestic production and up to 7.5 Bcm/year of LNG supplies through the Swinoujscie terminal.
