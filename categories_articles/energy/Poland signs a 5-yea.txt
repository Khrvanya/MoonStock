LNGWarsaw is prepared to purchase more expensive US gas and intends to sell it to other EU countries. Nevertheless, Poland's EU associates might choose cheaper gas supplies from Russia, according to Sergei Pravosudov, National Energy Institute's director.Sabine Pass liquefaction plant in Louisiana, will provide gas to Poland and other Central European countries. The LNG will be transported on a DES (delivered ex-ship) basis and the first deliveries will commence in 2018, four years before Poland's existing accord with Russia's Gazprom expires in 2022.

He added that Polish authorities might even ask the European Commission to subsidize its LNG supplies from the United States, but this would hardly be implemented and the desire to become a special partner for America and to acquire LNG from the US was mainly a political decision, in disfavor to commercial specificity.

Sergei Pravosudov declared "The Americans want to phase Russian gas out of Europe, but they do not have enough LNG and what they have costs more than what is offered by Russia. Therefore, I don't think they stand a chance to snap up the European energy market. Poland wants Gazprom to sell for less and could threaten not to sign a new long-term contract if it doesn't. But even in this case, the Poles will ink a short-term deal, which is less profitable, because energy prices depend on market fluctuations,".

PGNiG opened a LNG trading office in London, targeting to make Poland a connection between American LNG and Central and Eastern Europe. Nevertheless, Russia's deliveries of natural gas are far more affordable and less expensive if compared to America's LNG. Also, Europeans know that the transportation expenses and regasification of the American LNG is relatively high.
