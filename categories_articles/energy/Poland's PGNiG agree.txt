Natural GasState-run Polish gas firm PGNiG says it has agreed to buy a stake in a Norwegian gas field amid efforts to diversify supplies.PGNiG said on Thursday it was buying a 42.38-percent stake in the Tommeliten Alpha gas and condensate field in Norway from Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, for USD 220 million.
 
PGNiG Chief Executive Piotr Wozniak said in a statement that the acquisition in Norway was of special importance to the company and meant "a significant increase in natural gas production in the region."
 
Wozniak added: "It is from here that we plan to send gas to Poland via Denmark through the planned Baltic Pipe pipeline."
 
The Baltic Pipe is a planned new energy project to connect Poland with Norway via Denmark aiming to reduce the country's dependence on Russian gas.
 
PGNiG earlier this week said it had sealed a long-term deal for the purchase of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States as part of efforts to make Poland independent of Russian supplies.
