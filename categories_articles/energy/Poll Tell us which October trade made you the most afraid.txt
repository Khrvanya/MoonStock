  October was a busy month, dominated by news around the U.S.  presidential debates, a resurgent dollar, rising bond yields and  gyrating oil prices.  Recent polls had suggested Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was  pulling ahead in the race for the White House, which appeared  to be good news for stocks, as analysts said Wall Street was  betting on a Clinton win.But news on Friday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was  looking into freshly uncovered emails as part of its  investigation into Clinton's use of a private server sent equities lower as investors weighed the potential impact on  her polling numbers.The currency market has also seen big moves in October, with the  dollar strengthening against a basket of major currencies. The  yen pulled back to the 104 handle from 103 in recent weeks, while  the euro briefly sank to the $1.08 handle from levels above  $1.10, while a flash crash saw the British pound tumble from  $1.2600 to as low as $1.1491 briefly.  Oil prices swung between gains and losses throughout October;  prices were under pressure last week as investors doubted whether  OPEC and non-OPEC members would follow through in November with a  production freeze agreed in September in Algiers. On Saturday,  OPEC officials meeting in Vienna failed to reach an agreement on  the details of an output deal. Meanwhile, global bond yields have been rising as traders  adjusted to the prospect of the end of easy money from central  banks. The U.S. 10-year treasury note yield recently reached a  five-month high of 1.87 percent, while the German 10-year bund  rose from 0 to 0.17 percent.   So, as October draws to a close, tell us which trade made you the  most afraid.
