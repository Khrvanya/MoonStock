SolarPortugal is looking to contract between 700 MW to 800 MW of new solar capacity through a tender in the current quarter, local media reported on Tuesday.The Minister for the Environment and Energy Transition, Joao Pedro Matos Fernandes, made the announcement during a parliamentary hearing focused on the 2020 State Budget.
 
The minister said the new tender has been inspired by the success of last year's 1,400 MW bidding process, in which the country awarded 1,150 MW. French renewable power producer Akuo Energy SAS was the biggest winner with 370 MW secured. It also placed the record low bid of EUR 14.76 (USD 16.42) per MWh, 67% below the ceiling price of EUR 45/MWh.
 
The new 2020 tender will also include energy storage, Matos Fernades was quoted saying. The auction rules will be similar to these in the previous auction.
 
"Against the backdrop of planned auctions in a phased manner, it is expected that solar PV capacity in Portugal will reach around 8.8 GW by 2030," Pavan Vyakaranam, project manager at GlobalData, said in a recent notice.
