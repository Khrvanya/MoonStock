Natural Gas2020 will mark the start of Russian-piped gas exports to Chinese cities including Beijing, Harbin and Shanghai.Completed in June this year, the $9-billion Power of Siberia gas pipeline is part of the $400 billion contract signed in 2014 by Russia's Gazprom to supply 38 billion cubic metres (BCM) a year for 30 years to CNPC. 
 
With a maximum capacity of 61 BCM  this pipeline is designed to transmit natural gas from Irkutsk and Yakutia of southern Siberia to cities on the Russian side of the Amur River and onwards to China.
 
This 3,000 km pipeline crosses the Irkutsk, Amur and Sakha regions, which are host to hostile terrain
 
This gas pipeline offers benefits for both sides of the River Amur. For Russia this pipeline will bring the energy needed to develop this remote region.
 
China is the world's biggest importer of natural gas and thanks to growing urbanization, industrialization and environmental commitments, demand is expected to rise from 310 BCM to 510 BCM by 2030 according to Chinese official sources.
 
Once the Power of Siberia pipeline is fully operational in 2025, China expects to receive 38 BCM of Russian natural piped gases a year.
