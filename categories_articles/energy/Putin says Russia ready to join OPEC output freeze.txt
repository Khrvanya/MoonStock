 Russia is ready to join a proposed cap on oil output  by OPEC members, Russian President Vladimir  Putin told an energy congress on Monday.  Putin, speaking at an energy congress in the Turkish city of  Istanbul, said that low oil prices have lead to underinvestment  into the global energy sector which will turn into a deficit at  some point and trigger new "unpredictable jumps" in prices.  "That's why in the current situation we think that (an oil  output) freeze or even an oil production cut is likely to be the  only right decision to maintain the stability of the global  energy sector," Putin said.  "Russia is ready to join the joint measures to cap production and  is calling for other oil exporters to join," Putin said.  He added that he hoped that OPEC members would confirm the  decision to adopt quotas for output when the organization meets  in November.   Russian oil output jumped by almost 4 percent in September from  the previous month to 11.11 million barrels per day, a new  post-Soviet record-high, as companies ramped up drilling amid  improved oil prices.  Putin did not say at what level Russia would be ready to cap its  production.
