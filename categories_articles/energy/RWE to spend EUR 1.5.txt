RenewableGerman energy group RWE AG intends to invest about EUR 1.5 billion (USD 1.7bn) in renewables each year to grow an already imposing portfolio, to be formed through the pending merger of assets held by Innogy SE and E.on SE.In March 2018, RWE agreed to sell its majority interest in Innogy to E.on, while keeping Innogy's renewables business and merging it with the green assets of E.on. The move will give RWE ownership of an 8.6-GW renewable energy portfolio that will be housed in a new company with three operating divisions, the group explained on Thursday.
 
The new RWE renewables arm will focus on the fields of onshore and offshore wind, solar photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage.
 
In terms of geography, it will do business in the Americas, key markets in Europe and new markets in the Asia-Pacific region. The firm will be engaged in the development, engineering, construction, operation and commercialisation of renewable energy assets.
