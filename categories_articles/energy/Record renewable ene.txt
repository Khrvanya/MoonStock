RenewablePortugal generated more power from green sources than it needed last month.Renewable power generation surpassed power demand, representing 103.6% of consumption in March - a value said to be unmatched in the last 40 years.

The Portuguese Renewable Energy Association (APREN), based on data from electricity grid operator REN, affirmed while there were instances when fossil fuel plants were required to complement the power supply, they were entirely compensated by other periods of greater green production.

The association revealed that last month's success is a proof of what will happen more often in the upcoming period. In fact, it is planned that by 2040, the generation of renewable power will be able to guarantee, in a cost-effective way, the overall annual electricity consumption of Mainland Portugal.

The use of natural gas power plants, aggregated to interconnections and storage, will be eventually needed.
