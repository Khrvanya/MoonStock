CO2Taiyuan, the major producer of coal in the northern part of China, has prohibited the sale, transport and use of coal, as it intends to diminish air pollution, the state news agency Xinhua declared on Monday. 
The interdiction is in force from Sunday and the measure prohibits enterprises and citizens, except the big steel and power factories, from selling, carrying or burning coal in the public area of Taiyuan.

The restriction aims a decrease in the coal use by approximately 2 million tonnes, equal to 90 percent of Taiyuan's utilization.  
 
China's authorities required Beijing and neighbouring regions, including Shanxi, to cap concentrations of toxic wastes to meet the key smog targets beginning with October and lasting until March 2018.
 
This is the time when the pollution level rises significantly due to coal burn for heating premises during the cold season.    

Taiyuan has already swapped coal-burning household heating machinery for electric and natural gas stoves.
