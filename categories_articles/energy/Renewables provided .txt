Increasing output from oil, bioenergy and waste, wind and solar contributed to total energy production rising 3.7% higher than in 2017, marking the fourth successive yearly increase.
 
Gas accounted for 39.4% of total generation whilst coal made up only 5%, a record low.
 
Nuclear generation also declined slightly due to reactor outages and required maintenance, at the same time as oil output rose by 9%.
 
Total primary energy consumption for energy use was 0.6% lower than in 2017 and 1.3% lower when adjusted to take account of weather differences between 2017 and 2018.
