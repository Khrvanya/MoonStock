Oil MarketRockRose Energy has agreed to purchase the total amount of Idemitsu Petroleum UK share capital from Japanese corporation Idemitsu Kosan.  The acquisition will be backed by the financial means and current facilities of the company.  
The finalization of the acquisition depends on the approval from the UK Oil and Gas Authority that there is no objection to the modifications that occur. The deal brings with it several important employees in London and that will heighten RockRose's internal expertise in administrating a larger portfolio.

Andrew Austin, Chairman of RockRose affirmed: "RockRose is continuing to deliver on its stated strategy of building a business through the acquisition of mature producing assets. We believe that this acquisition is a significant one for the Company and that this portfolio also has a lot of potential for extended field life and gives Rockrose access to significant tax losses."

He further revealed: "We continue to review further acquisition opportunities in North West Europe and, post completion of this along with the previously announced Maersk, Sojitz and Egerton transactions by the end of this year, will have established a material business in the North Sea, set to deliver value to our shareholders."

The acquisition represents a reverse appropriation of the targets of the listing rules. The company has requested the UK Listing Authority to delay the listing the shares as soon as possible. RockRose Energy commits to produce and publish a professional's report about their assets after the acquisition in upcoming weeks.
