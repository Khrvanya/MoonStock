Oil MarketRomania's greatest oil and gas consortium, OMV Petrom, declared on Tuesday that its 860 MW Brazi power plant is currently working at full capacity.  On 13 November, the second energy site became operational after the fixing of the damaged transformer.  The Brazi power plant producing at its highest capacity, can compensate up to 10% of Romania's average hourly electricity use.

Since the end of September 2016, OMV Petrom has confronted with issues at two transformers in Brazi. Between October 2016 and April 2017, the power plant worked only at half of its capacity, and between April and June 2017, it was fully non-operational. Once one of the transformers was changed with another one at the beginning of the third quarter in 2017, the plant started to function at 50% of its potential.

The Brazi power plant is situated in Prahova county, in southern Romania. It is the biggest private greenfield project for power production in Romania. Brazi launched its activity in 2011, following an investment of 530 million euro ($601 million) made by OMV Petrom. 

The plant, which comprises two gas turbines, two heat recovery boilers and a steam turbine, has a higher designed efficiency of around 57% comparing with the average of 30% of units in Romania with equivalent capacities.

OMV owns a stake of 51.01% in OMV Petrom shares, while the Romanian state, through the energy ministry, holds 20.64%, Fondul Proprietatea has 9.9985% rate, and the remainder of 18.35% is in free access for the Bucharest Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange.
