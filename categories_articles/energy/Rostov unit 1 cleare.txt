NuclearRussian regulator Rostechnadzor has issued an operating licence extension for unit 1 of the Rostov nuclear power plant in southwest Russian to 2031. As of 9 January, the VVER-1000 unit had generated 148.174 terawatt hours of electricity since it started operations in 2001.Last month, Rostechnadzor issued operating licence extensions for unit 3 of Smolensk NPP until 2034, unit 2 of Kola NPP to 2034, unit 2 of Bilibino NPP until 2025, and unit 4 of Novovoronezh NPP until 2032.
 
The four-unit Rostov plant generated 33.887 TWh of electricity last year, above the 31.64 TWh target set by the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS). It achieved a capacity factor of 107.1% (above that set in the FAS plan of 89.62%). For comparison, in 2018, the plant produced to 29.369 TWh and had a capacity factor of 89.7%. The FAS generation plan for unit 1 for 2020 is 7.77 TWh.
 
The Rostov plant is located on the banks of the Tsimlyansk reservoir, nearly 14 km (8 miles) from the city of Volgodonsk. Four 1000 MWe VVER pressurized water reactors have been planned at the Rostov site since the early 1980s. Construction of units 1 and 2 began promptly, but progress faltered. Units 1 and 2 eventually entered commercial operation in March 2001 and October 2010, respectively. Unit 3 was connected to the grid in December 2014.
