The counterparts will also make an audit and evaluation of the technical situation of the mothballed Bataan nuclear power plant, looking for possibilities to recover its operational capacity. 

Russia will assist the Philippines in executing feasibility studies regarding the edification of small modular reactors, either onshore or offshore. 

The Philippines DoE said feasibility studies will not relate just to analysis of technical, commercial, financial and legal specifications. These may also cover the construction of conventional nuclear power sites. The cooperation will be made via joint working groups which will be responsible for specific projects and tasks; the exchange of experts; workshops; training and education of human resources; and exchange of technical information.

The parties intend to enhance economic, scientific and technical collaboration in peaceful uses of atomic power, commonly explore applications of radiation technologies in industry, medicine and agriculture. They also plan to organize a couple of events to raise public awareness about nuclear technologies and their application in the Philippines.
