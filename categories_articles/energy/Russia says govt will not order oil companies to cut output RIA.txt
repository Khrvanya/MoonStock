Russia's government will  not order Russian oil companies to cut output as part of a deal with OPEC, RIA News  agency cited Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich as saying on  Thursday.   "We have no such authority in the government. We don't have any  kind of international agreement which would give such a  possibility," RIA quoted Dvorkovich as saying.    Russia's oil companies support energy ministry proposals to cap  oil output as part of a global deal, a ministry spokeswoman said  on Wednesday.
