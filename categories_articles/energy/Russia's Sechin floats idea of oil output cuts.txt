The head of Russian state-run oil company Rosneft on Wednesday floated the idea of a coordinated  output cut by major oil-producing countries to prop up sagging prices but fell short  of saying whether Moscow would contribute to such a plan.       Rosneft Chief Executive Igor Sechin, a close ally  of President Vladimir Putin, told the IP Week conference in London that the global oil  glut was predominantly the fault of the Organization of the Petroleum  Exporting Countries (OPEC).       Sechin suggested major oil producers cut production  by 1 million barrels per day (bpd) to reduce oversupply, which he  estimated at 1.5 million bpd.        "A coordinated supply cut by major exporters by  around 1 million barrels per day would sharply reduce uncertainty  and would move the market towards reasonable pricing levels," he  said.       Oil prices have slumped more than 70 percent to  near $30 a barrel over the past 18 months as supply exceeded  demand after OPEC, seeking to drive higher-cost producers out of  the market, decided not to cut production.       Sechin has in the past criticised OPEC's strategy,  saying the group, of which Russia is not a member, had "lost its  teeth". He has also said Moscow would never cooperate with OPEC  as Russia's oil industry could withstand any price rout thanks to  cheap labour and a weak local currency.       On Wednesday, Sechin gave similar messages but  chose his words more carefully, rarely mentioning OPEC and  blaming only "some producers" for creating the glut.       Oil markets have risen in recent weeks on hopes of  a deal between OPEC and non-OPEC producers after a number of  Russian officials suggested dialogue should begin.       But Putin has not spoken yet on the subject.  Wednesday's speech by Sechin was also his first statement on the  subject in recent weeks.    Sechin declined to say whether Russia would  participate in any coordinated cut, when quizzed by reporters  after the speech.       "Who are we supposed to be talking to about cuts?  Will Saudi Arabia or Iran cut production?" Sechin asked.       Struggling oil-producing countries have urged OPEC  leader Saudi Arabia in recent weeks to call a special meeting to  discuss output cuts.          Riyadh has indicated it would be willing to  consider a cut only if all major producers agreed to one, while  Iraq and Iran have said they intend to boost their output this  year.       Sechin said he expected Iran to ramp up oil  production to between 5 million and 6 million bpd by 2025 from 3  million now as the country opens up after the lifting of  sanctions.       Sechin also said U.S. shale production, another key  driver behind the global glut, would decline in the long  term.       "Shale oil production has its limitations in scope  and time ... U.S. shale oil production will reach its peak in  2020," he said.       Sechin said however that onshore U.S. producers had  proven more resilient to the oil price downturn.       "Shale oil markets reacted very quickly to the  price shock as productivity rose dramatically, costs of  production dropped and fracking became more efficient," Sechin  said.
