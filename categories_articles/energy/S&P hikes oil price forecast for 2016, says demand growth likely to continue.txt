  S&P Global Ratings has raised its price forecast for Brent  and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil for the rest of the  year.   The international ratings agency now sees crude oil averaging  $42.50 per barrel for the rest of 2016, up from a previous  forecast of $40.00.   "The current oversupply of oil appears unlikely to persist into  the medium or longer term as natural field depletion and a lower  number of new field developments have a greater bearing on  supply," S&P said in a report on Wednesday, adding that  oversupply was likely to continue well into 2017.  Crude prices have recently rallied but remain far below their  peaks above $100 per barrel reached before the commodities rout  that began in July 2014.   Light crude futures for November traded at around $44.85 per  barrel on Wednesday, with Brent crude futures at around  $46.55.   "We continue to assume no material difference between the prices  of WTI and Brent oil, based on both the feasibility of U.S. crude  oil exports and our observation of this spread being generally  much less than $2.5 per barrel in the year to date," S&P  said.   Demand growth for oil was likely to continue for the next years,  but would be "variable," S&P added.    The oil market is in heightened focus ahead of a meeting of OPEC  and other major crude-producing countries in September 26-28 in  Algeria. Speculation that these countries might agree to an oil  output freeze to boost prices has rocked the market. Follow CNBC International  on Twitter and Facebook.
