  Oil could continue its deep slide, possibly dipping into bear  market territory, under new pressure from Saudi Arabia's decision to defend market share, as  opposed to cutting production to battle falling prices. A well-supplied oil market, helped by increased North  American production and softer global demand as Europe's economy  falters and Chinese demand growth slows, has created a supply  imbalance that has driven prices sharply lower. The Saudi move is  counter to expectations that it would further cut its 9.6 million  barrel-a-day production to bring back oil prices. West Texas Intermediate oil futures for November hit a  17-month low early Thursday, falling below the $90 mark for the  first time since April 2013. That was a 16 percent decline from  its June high. Brent, the international benchmark, fell to a  27-month low of $91.55 per barrel, before recovering at about $93  per barrel for November futures. Brent, at the low, was about 19  percent off its high. A weaker dollar helped lift oil off its lows.  Oil analysts expect oil to fall another couple percent, which  could take both WTI and Brent into bear market territory—a  20 percent decline from recent highs.
