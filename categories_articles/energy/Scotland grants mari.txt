WindScotland has given a marine licence to the roughly 800-MW Moray West offshore wind project in the outer Moray Firth Zone, the government announced on Friday.The consent represents the final step in the permitting process that will allow the project to compete in the upcoming UK government Contracts for Difference (CfD) auction this summer. The scheme is a joint development of Portuguese utility Energias de Portugal SA and French peer Engie SA.
 
The Moray West wind farm will be built 22.5km (14 miles) off the Caithness coast as a sister site of the 950-MW Moray East wind farm, whose 100 MHI Vestas 9.5-MW turbines are planned to become operational in 2022. The follow-on project will feature up to 85 turbines, according to the government's statement.
