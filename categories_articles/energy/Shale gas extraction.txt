Natural GasAccording to a new report from The University of Manchester, shale gas fracking is considered one of the least sustainable ways to produce electricity. Among the nine forms of power generation, fracking is ranked on the seventh place.The other fuels taken into consideration were coal, nuclear, natural gas, liquefied natural gas, solar, wind, hydro and biomass. The cleanest energy options are considered wind and solar energy.

Researchers say fracking would need to attain 329-fold reduction in environmental effects and a 16-fold increase in employment to turn into a sustainable option. The indicators included climate change impacts, environmental pollution, costs of electricity, creation of jobs and public observations.

The UK Government thinks that shale gas has the potential to offer higher energy security, growth and jobs to UK.

Professor Adisa Azapagic from the School of Chemical Engineering & Analytical Science, declared: "Many countries are considering exploitation of shale gas but its overall sustainability is disputed."

INEOS Shale has wrote a petition for judicial review of the Scottish Government's decision to prohibit fracking.
