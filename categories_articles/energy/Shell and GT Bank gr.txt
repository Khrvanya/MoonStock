Oil MarketNigeria's Guaranty Trust Bank and a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell have agreed to offer a $270 million loan to independent Nigerian oil and gas producing company Amni International.Under the terms of the loan, Shell Western Supply and Trading sole will have access to the 16,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil the firm pumps in two fields off Nigeria's oil-rich Delta area.

Production at offshore fields, counting Amni's Ima and Okoro/Setu, is complicated to be maintained, but Amni declared that the loan would permit them to continue developing the fields. The energy firm has an offshore concession in Ghana as well.

Tunde Afolabi, Amni's Chief Executive, stated: "We are excited to work with GT Bank and Shell as commercial and financial partners to enable the realisation of Amni's ambitious plans for growth."

At the beginning of the year, Nigeria's Shoreline inked a similar type of agreement estimated at $530 million with major oil trader Vitol supported by several banks. The Nigerian government is also switching to private companies with the aim to invest in everything from refinery modernisations to oil pipeline reconstruction.
