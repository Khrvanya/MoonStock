RenewableRoyal Dutch Shell revealed an ambitious plan to double its investments in green energy in what appears to be the next phase in the oil giant's efforts to decarbonize.Shell will boost its expenditures on low-carbon energy to $4 billion a year -- a staggering increase from its commitment to spend $1-$2 billion annually on green energy within the next two years. The Netherlands-based company has a total budget of $25 billion, the rest of which will still be spent on hydrocarbons.
 
"I would like my current business to be financially credible enough for not only the company, but shareholders, to want to double it and look at more," Maarten Wetselaar, the integrated gas and new energies director for Shell, stated to the Guardian in a Tuesday report. Wetselaar indicated that if Shell sees enough return on its investments, the company will likely spend more on green energy development from 2020 and beyond.
 
Shell, under pressure from climate change activists, has made a number of environmentally-friendly commitments in recent years.
