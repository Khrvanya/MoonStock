RenewableRoyal Dutch Shell will return to paying cash dividends and continue funding in greener energy as the its situation improves after a period of more than two years of cost reductions and disposals generated by weak oil prices.Ben van Beurden, Shell Chief Executive Officer is looking for a balance between reconvincing investors it can boost returns in its core fossil fuel business during an instability period of oil prices while getting ready to intensify investments in alternative sources.

The Anglo-Dutch company mentioned it will abandon its scrip dividend, via which investors can chose to obtain dividends in shares or cash, in the fourth quarter of 2017. The strategy was instituted at the beginning of 2015 to aid maintaining cash after oil prices dropped by more than half from over $100 a barrel and the firm acquired BG Group in a transaction estimated at $54 billion.

BP had beaten its competitors when announcing last month that it would restart shares buybacks in the fourth quarter to counterbalance the weakening effect of the scrip dividend. The Norwegian energy company Statoil has also abolished its scrip dividend.

Shell, which relied extensively on a boosting demand for natural gas in the transformation to cleaner energy, also fixed ambitious goals to cut its carbon activity. It increased planned investment in its new fields of power which concentrates on renewable sources and low carbon technologies to $1-2 billion until 2020 from the actual $1 billion.

Ben van Beurden declared: We have to start somewhere, and we have to build a platform that can participate and grow actively in further electrifying the world. The company, which has made a number of investments in electric vehicle technology in recent months, said it will aim to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 20 percent by 2035 and by half in 2050. The targets will be expanded to include all of Shell's operations."

The new energies unit is scheduled to be one of Shell's principal growth engines after 2020 and make revenues of 8 to 9 percent.
