Natural GasShell and its partner Ithaca Energy have taken a final investment decision to build new gas production facilities at the UK's Pierce field in the Central North Sea.The Pierce Depressurisation Project will enable Shell to start exporting gas from the Pierce field via the SEGAL pipeline to St Fergus in Scotland, the site of one of the UK's main gas terminals, Shell said.
 
The development work is scheduled to take place between 2020 and 2021 and, when complete, the Pierce field is expected to produce more than 30,000 b/d oil equivalent at peak production, the oil major said. According to government figures, the oil and gas field was producing about 11,000 b/d of oil and 80 MMcf/d of gas during the first half of the year.
 
Under the new project, the field's existing floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel will be modified, in addition to a new subsea gas export line to the SEGAL pipeline system and the drilling of new wells.
 
Shell operates the Pierce field with 92.52% stake and Ithaca Energy holds the remaining 7.48% share.
