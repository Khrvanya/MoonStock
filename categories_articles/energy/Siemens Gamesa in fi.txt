WindSiemens Gamesa Renewable Energy SA said Monday it is in final negotiations with Swedish state-owned utility Vattenfall AB to supply turbines for the Hollandse Kust Zuid (HKZ) I & II offshore wind projects in Dutch waters.If the negotiations result in a contract, the Spanish turbine maker will supply its new SG 10.0-193 DD offshore wind turbines for the HKZ I & II, which were awarded to Vattenfall in the Dutch government's zero-subsidy offshore wind tender last year. The two companies already have a contract for the III and IV portions of the HKZ project, however, its realisation will depend on the outcome of the new offshore wind tender and whether Vattenfall will take the final investment decision (FID).
 
The Hollandse Kust Zuid zone comprises four separate sites. Last March, Vattenfall secured a permit for the HKZ I & II sites totalling between 700 MW and 750 MW. The wind farms, which will be capable of producing electricity for up to 1.5 million households, have to be operational in 2023.
