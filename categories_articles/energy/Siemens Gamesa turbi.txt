WindSiemens Gamesa Renewable Energy SA has been selected as the preferred supplier of turbines for an up to 455-MW offshore wind project in Japanese waters off the coast of Akita prefecture, the company announced on Wednesday.Tokyo-headquartered construction company Obayashi Corporation has entered into an agreement that outlines the use of Siemens Gamesa's SG 8.0-167 DD turbine model as part of the Northern Akita Offshore Wind Farm project in the northern region of Tohoku. The two companies have also agreed on a long-term service contract.
 
The 2018 law promoting offshore wind in Japan requires that Obayashi takes part in a national tender in order to obtain development rights for the project. The company will award a firm turbine supply order to Siemens Gamesa only after taking a final investment decision for the project. The plan is to have the wind farm up and running from 2024 onwards.
