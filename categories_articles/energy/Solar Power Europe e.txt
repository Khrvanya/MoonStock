SolarGlobal solar power installations increased by around 5 percent to 104.1 GW in 2018, in comparison to 99.1 GW in 2017.Solar installations in Europe grew by 20 percent to 11 GW in 2018, up from 9.2 GW in 2017. The EU-28 grew by 36 percent to 8.0 GW in 2018, up from 5.9 GW of newly installed capacity in the previous year, according to the latest figures of the solar power association >>Solar Power Europe<< (SPE).
 
The organization estimates that Germany is regaining the number one solar spot in Europe after five years, adding nearly 3 GW in 2018, growing around 68 percent year-on-year. The second largest European market was the previous market leader Turkey, adding approximately 1.6 GW, with the Netherlands coming in for the first time as a top 3 solar market, adding 1.4 GW in 2018. France ranked just behind after adding 0.9 GW year-on-year, ahead of Italy with 0.5 GW.
 
>>The EU has set the stage for solar growth by removing the trade measures on solar panels and providing the right framework for solar to thrive through the Clean Energy Package legislation,<< said Christian Westermeier, President of Solar Power Europe. >>Now it's time to take European solar to the next level by putting in place an industrial competitiveness strategy that will unlock massive investments in the solar sector, create high-tech jobs and provide the most cost-competitive clean power to meet the EU's energy and climate targets.<<
