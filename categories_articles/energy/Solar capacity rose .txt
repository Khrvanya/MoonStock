SolarSolar capacity enhanced by 50% during 2016, growing faster than other energy sources.  
The International Energy Agency (IEA) claims that China takes the lead and accounts likely for a half of the increase. 
 
The agency also sustains that China's expansion in renewables is mainly due to its worries about climate. 
 
A strong solar market boosted renewables which accounted for about two-thirds of new power capacity globally last year.
 
By 2022, the renewable electricity capacity is likely to enhance by another 43%, exceeding 8,000 terawatt hours, which equals to the total power consumption of China, India and Germany combined.
 

IEA's official declared that the new sources of renewable energy will generate 1,000 GW by 2022, or a half of the current global capacity in coal power, which has been created within 80 years. He also added that the solar energy age is approaching. 
 
There is a strong belief that solar capacity increase will largely exceed any other renewable technology until 2022.
