SolarTurkey's solar power capacity has reached 6,000 megawatts (MW), Berke Aygun, the head of Solar Energy Investors Association (GUYAD), has told Anadolu Agency.Data from the association show that solar power plants generated 9,085 GWh of electricity as of end-November, which already exceeded the total of some 7,800 GWh of power produced at those power plants in the whole of 2018.
 
Power generation from solar plants accounted for some 3.31 percent of total electricity production, while the sector's installed capacity corresponded to 6.45 percent of the country's total 91,375 MW electricity installed capacity as of November.
 
In November alone, solar power plants generated 580 GWh of electricity. The highest level of electricity production of the country's power plants was recorded in June, July and August with 1,015, 1,125 and 1,072 GWH, respectively.
 
Last year, solar power plants provided 2.56 percent of the country's electricity output. Renewables all together (including geothermal, wind, solar and waste) accounted for 12.73 percent of electricity generation. The shares of geothermal and wind power plants were 2.44 percent and 6.54 percent, respectively.
 
Some 30.3 percent of electricity was generated from natural gas while hydropower plants' share was 19.66 percent in 2018.
