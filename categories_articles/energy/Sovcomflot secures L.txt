LNGSovcomflot (SCF Group) has signed a new US$297 million limited recourse credit facility, for up to 10 years, with three leading international banks: ING Bank; KfW IPEX-Bank, and Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank.The funds will be used towards pre and post-delivery financing of two new-generation, 174 000 m3, Atlanticmax LNG carriers; which will operate under long-term charters to Shell.
 
The vessels feature a slow-speed dual-fuel X-DF diesel engine and gas boil-off partial liquefaction system. The first of these vessels is scheduled for delivery in 2H20, the other in 1H21. The addition of these vessels will increase the group's liquefied gas carrier fleet to 16 vessels, and is fully in line with the group's strategy of expanding its long-term business with core clients.
 
This deal follows a similar US$149 million credit facility signed in November 2018, between SCF Group and these three banks, to finance the construction of an LNG carrier, which will operate on long-term charter to Total.
