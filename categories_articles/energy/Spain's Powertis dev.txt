SolarPowertis SA, a Madrid-based developer of large-scale photovoltaic (PV) projects in Europe and Latin America, is working on a portfolio of 765 MW of solar power capacity to be installed in the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo.With an investment reaching BRL 2.5 billion (USD 613.3m/EUR 554.7m), the projects will be capable of generating enough power to meet the needs of more than one million households. Brazilian development banks BNDES and Banco do Nordeste do Brasil SA (BNB) will provide the financing which Powertis expects to close in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020.
 
The portfolio consists of one 495-MW and three 90-MW solar farms. The company has secured power purchase agreements (PPAs) with two Brazilian off-takers thanks to which it will be able to operate the plants until the end of 2041.
 
Spain's Soltec Energias Renovables SL will supply solar trackers for all four projects and assist in the assembly and construction.
 
The solar farms are planned to start operations in January 2021 and January 2022.
