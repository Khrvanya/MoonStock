CO2The Norwegian continental shelf will unite Statoil, Shell and Total in their endeavour to collaborate on a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project. 
Norway plans to largely extend the CCS project across the country.  
 

In June, Statoil was granted a contract by Gassnova for the first stage of the scheme, having now Norske Shell and Total E&P Norge as equal partners.
 

Partners stated that the first phase is likely to have capacity for approximately 1.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) a year and will be designed to host a bigger amount.
 

The project will stock the CO2 absorbed from industrial sector in eastern Norway and then convey the gas by a vessel to a receiving terminal on the west coast on the nation. 
 
 
Afterwards, the CO2 will then be transferred to storage tanks before being injected in wells east of the Troll field on the Norwegian continental shelf.
 

The firms declared that three sites have been already selected to serve as the receiving terminal but the final decision is to be taken a bit later this year.
