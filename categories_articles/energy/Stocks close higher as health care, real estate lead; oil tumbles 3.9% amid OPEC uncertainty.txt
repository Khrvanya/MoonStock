  U.S. equities closed higher on Tuesday, led by health care and real estate, as investors digested falling  oil prices ahead of a key OPEC meeting, as well as economic  data.  The Dow Jones industrial average closed about 25 points higher,  with UnitedHealth Group contributing the most gains. The  S&P 500 gained 0.1 percent, with health care and real estate rising about 0.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite outperformed,  closing 0.2 percent higher and hitting a new intraday high of 5,403.86. The three major indexes  traded lower earlier in the session.  U.S. stocks closed lower on Monday, as a post-election rally  paused, with the major indexes dropping off from all-time high  levels. The small-caps Russell 2000, which has been outperforming  large-cap indexes, fell more than 1 percent, snapping a 15-day  winning streak, its longest in 20 years.  "I think we're at a point where people are afraid of pushing the  market too far off the fundamentals, but I don't think there are  any news that could push the market markedly lower" in the near  term, said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key  Private Bank. West Texas Intermediate futures for January delivery dropped 3.9 percent to settle at $45.23 per barrel. OPEC are set to meet in Vienna, Austria on Wednesday  and traders will be keeping a close eye on announcements  regarding an oil production cut. In September, OPEC had outlined  a deal to cut output by approximately 1 million barrels per  day.  "All eyes are on the upcoming OPEC meeting and traders are  awaiting the decision. The headlines are not very positive and  this is making investors very jittery," Naeem Aslam, chief market  analyst at Think Markets, said in a note.  Indonesian Energy Minister Ignasius Jonan said he was not sure  OPEC would clinch a deal to limit oil output when it met.  Meanwhile, non-OPEC producer Russia confirmed on Tuesday it  would not attend the OPEC gathering, but added that a meeting  between the group and non-affiliated producers at a later stage  was possible.  That said, stocks had retained gains for most of Tuesday, as of afternoon trade. "We're seeing a bit of decoupling between oil prices and  stocks," said Adam Sarhan, CEO at 50 Park Investments. "Since  [President-elect Donald] Trump won, equities have soared, and oil  has not."  "Unless we see a breakout below $40 or above $50, the market is  comfortable with oil trading in this range," Sarhan said.  In economic news, the second read on third-quarter GDP came in at  an annualized rate of 3.2 percent, above a previous reading of  2.9 percent.  "While old news, the revision provides us with the baseline from  which Q4 activity began. On a 4 quarter run rate, GDP growth is  now averaging 1.6% and 1.8% in the 3 quarters year to date," said  Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a  note to clients.  Other data released Tuesday included the S&P Core Logic  Case-Shiller index, which showed U.S. home prices gained 5.5  percent in September. The Consumer confidence index for  November came in at 107.1, well above expectations.  Economic data has been at the forefront for investors as they  brace themselves for a possible interest rate hike from the  Federal Reserve next month. According to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, market  expectations for a December rate hike are above 95 percent.  Treasury prices recovered to erase earlier losses on Tuesday, with the two-year note yield  trading at 1.099 percent and the benchmark 10-year yield around 2.302 percent. The U.S. dollar slipped about 0.35 percent against a basket of  currencies, with the euro around $1.064 and the yen around  112.6. However, the greenback has strengthened considerably recently. Joe O'Leary, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank, said the dollar's rise has been driven by optimism in the U.S. economy. "I think that, compared to the rest of the world, we're in a pretty good place," he said.  Overseas, European equities closed mostly higher, with the  Stoxx 600 Europe index gaining 0.33 percent.  The Dow Jones industrial average rose 23.70 points, or 0.12 percent,  to close at 19,121.60, with UnitedHealth leading advancers and Chevron the  biggest decliner.  The  gained 2.94 points, or 0.13 percent, to end at  2,204.66, with real estate leading nine sectors higher and energy and telecommunications lagging.  The Nasdaq advanced 11.11 points, or 0.21 percent, to close at 5,379.  Decliners were a step ahead of advancers at the New York Stock  Exchange, with an exchange volume of 912.20 million and a composite  volume of 3.638 billion at the close.  The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge  of fear in the market, traded lower, near 12.7.Gold futures for December delivery fell $2.90 to $1,187.90 per ounce.—CNBC's Sam Meredith and Reuters contributed to this report.
