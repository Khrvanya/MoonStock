LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The following table shows crude oil output by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in millions of barrels per day (bpd) in September and August, according to a Reuters survey published on Monday. OPEC, Russia and other non-members - an alliance known as OPEC+ - agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd in 2019. OPEC's share of that cut is 800,000 bpd among the 11 members participating in the deal. The September survey indicates that total OPEC output fell by 750,000 bpd. Compared with the levels from which they agreed to cut, which in most cases was October 2018 output, the 11 members have reduced production by 1.769 million bpd. Given the pledged reductions total 812,000 bpd, that equates to 218% compliance. August compliance was 131%. August's estimate was revised upwards by a total of 40,000 bpd after new information on output in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.September    August     Baseline  Pledged     Cut        Compliance  2019output      output     for cut   cut         achieved   (%)*        target***Algeria          1.02        1.03      1.057     32,000      37,000     1161.025Angola            1.4        1.36      1.528     47,000      128,000    2721.481Congo            0.33        0.34      0.325     10,000.000  -5,000negative    0.315Ecuador          0.54        0.54      0.524     16,000      -16,000negative    0.508Eq.

The Reuters survey aims to assess crude supply to market, defined to exclude movements to, but not sales from, storage. Saudi and Kuwaiti data includes the Neutral Zone. Venezuelan data includes upgraded synthetic oil. Nigerian output is defined to include the Agbami and Egina streams and exclude Akpo condensate.(Editing by David Goodman)
