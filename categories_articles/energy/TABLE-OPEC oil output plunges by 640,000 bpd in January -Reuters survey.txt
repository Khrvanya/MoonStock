LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The following table shows crude oil output by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in millions of barrels per day (bpd) in January and December, according to a Reuters survey published on Friday.A new production cut agreement by OPEC and allies including Russia started on Jan. 1. The deal deepens an existing supply curb of 1.2 million barrels per day by 500,000 bpd. OPEC's share of the 1.7 million bpd cut is 1.17 million bpd. The January survey indicates that total OPEC output fell by 640,000 bpd from December. Compared with the levels from which they agreed to cut, which in most cases was October 2018 output, 10 OPEC members have reduced production by 1.556 million bpd. Given the pledged reductions total 1.17 million bpd, that equates to 133% compliance. In December, compliance with the previous agreement was 158%. Ecuador quit OPEC at the end of 2019. The country has been removed from December's total so as to more easily compare production by the remaining 13 members. OPEC members Iran, Libya and Venezuela did not participate in the agreement to cut production.1.0131.4810.3110.1220.1794.4622.6691.75310.1443.01225.146NOTES: Totals are rounded and may not add.* Compliance is calculated by the following method in the table above. Baseline for cut minus January output = cut achieved. Cut achieved divided by pledged cut = percentage compliance.** Iran, Libya and Venezuela are exempt from making voluntary output cuts.*** Pledged cuts apply from Jan. 1, 2020 and are the sum of figures given by OPEC on its website apart from a revised target for Nigeria which emerged in October 2019. based on figures OPEC gave for pledged cuts and the baseline from which to apply them. The Reuters survey aims to assess crude supply to market, defined to exclude movements to, but not sales from, storage. Saudi and Kuwaiti data includes the Neutral Zone. Venezuelan data includes upgraded synthetic oil. Nigerian crude output is defined to include the Agbami and Egina streams and exclude Akpo condensate.(Reporting by Alex Lawler Additional reporting by Rania El Gamal, Editing by Susan Fenton)
