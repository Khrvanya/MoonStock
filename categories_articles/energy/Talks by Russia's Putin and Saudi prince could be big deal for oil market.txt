  Russian President Vladimir Putin's seemingly cozy talks with  Saudi Arabia could put a floor under oil prices, possibly  limiting what could have been a sharp drop later this month.  In a surprise move over the long Labor Day weekend, Russia and  Saudi Arabia agreed to cooperate in world oil markets. There was  no immediate deal to act but they say they are moving toward  a strategic energy partnership and could take action in the  future. The joint statement was signed by both countries' oil  ministers on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in China, after a  meeting between Putin and Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin  Salman.   While skepticism swirled that the world's two biggest oil  producers would actually strike a deal, the fact they are talking  and publicly seeking to cooperate is a big step. The crude market  was surprised by the announcement that came out of the G-20, because it had not been prepared for anything but chatter ahead  of a meeting between OPEC and non-cartel producers in Algeria at  the end of the month.
