Commodities are something many investors can relate to. What's not to like about corn, crude oil, or copper? Some commodities have been on a tear in recent months. In fact, the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index, a global commodity benchmark tracking 19 commodities that are mostly U.S. traded, is near a two-and-a-half year high.
