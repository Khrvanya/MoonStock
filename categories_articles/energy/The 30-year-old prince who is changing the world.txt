  A 30-year-old you may have never heard of is trying to build a  company worth four Apples — and a Nike to spare.   Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a fast riser in the  Saudi hierarchy and member of the new generation, has the world's  ear after an expansive interview where he elaborated on his plan  for taking the mega-giant state oil company public.   Bin Salman, son of King Salman, was the surprise choice to serve  as deputy to Crown Prince Muhammad bin Nayef, the 56-year-old who  had been seen as a possible heir apparent but is now viewed by some  as more of a rival. Bin Nayef is interior minister who rose to  power on his success as head of the Saudi counterterrorism  program. King Salman, himself 80, took the throne when King  Abdullah died in January 2015.
