RenewableThe accelerated fall in wind and solar energy costs, and flexible demand technology could substitute more than 50% of coal and gas generated electricity in Europe by 2030, as indicated in a recent research published on Tuesday.
 The report which updates the cost calculations of the European Commission in elaborating EU's energy and climate change objectives up to 2030, states that the bloc could surely expect a 61% share of electricity generated from renewable sources by 2030, instead of the 49% currently forecasted.
 
This would be equivalent to extra 265 million of tonnes of avoided CO2 emissions, and annual savings of EUR600 million in energy system costs.

Laurence Tubiana, the CEO of the European Climate Foundation (ECF), which commissioned the research declared: "The drop in the cost of clean technology has gone far beyond all expectations. The economics are now decisively tipping in favour of clean energy, making an even stronger case for higher EU ambition for 2030,".

Jonathan Gaventa, director at E3G, a climate change think tank considers "Cheap renewables push out gas as well as coal. European countries should feel confident that they can phase out coal power without increasing energy security risks or new dependence on imported gas."

Generally, the increase in low-cost sources of green energy, together with greater end-use efficiency and improved grids, is putting Europe in the situation to deal with structural overcapacity in electricity generation, and policymakers should create policies for a logical phase out of coal.
