SolarUK developer WElink Energy has commenced to build a 221MW solar park in Algarve.For the construction work of Solara4 project at Vaqueiros, estimated at PS200 million, China Triumph International Engineering (CTIEC) is contracted. The installation will represent Europe's biggest unsubsidized solar plant.

WElink Group chief executive Barry O'Neill announced: "We are delighted to be in a position to commence construction on our flagship Solara4 project, demonstrating that industrial scale clean-energy can be profitable without government subsidies and is a mature technology."

Solara4 will have 850,000 solar modules and is likely to come online in the middle of 2019. Once operating, the plant should generate enough power for about 150,000 homes per year.

WElink Energy affirmed that it will be able to put into practice the project without appealing to government subsidies. That was possible due to the rising competitiveness in the solar energy field and the convenient location of the park that has one of the highest solar irradiation levels in Europe. 

The UK energy company said it is seeking additional projects in Iberia and will make them known in time.
