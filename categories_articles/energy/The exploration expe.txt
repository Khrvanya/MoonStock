Oil MarketDespite the strongest beginning for oil prices in the last four years, the major oil companies in the world are not very eager to hasten the search for new resources as their willpower to retain capital discipline surpasses the hope of making successful discoveries.According to consultancy Wood Mackenzie (WoodMac), energy companies such as Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and their peers are determined to reduce expenses on oil and gas exploration for a fifth year in a row in 2018, although an increasing urgency to refill reserves after years of trying to cover the funding made.

World investment in exploration, crucial to boost output and counterbalance the natural decline of existing fields, will attain $37 billion in 2018, or a decrease of 7 percent compared with 2016 and more than 60 percent below the 2014 peak.

Exploration is likely to aim mainly deepwater basins like Mexico, Brazil and Guyana where large discoveries have been made in recent years, offering more confidence that additional resources could be found.

The most desired exploration wells are BP and Kosmos Energy in Senegal, Total and Petrobras in Brazil, Exxon in Guyana, Total and Pemex in Mexico and Eni in Cyprus.

Last October, the increasing interest for exploration was made clear when the top oil companies vied for blocks strived in a competition for Brazil's first deepwater oil auction for foreign operators, where Shell was given half of the blocks.
