Natural GasTrans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline's (TANAP) project is 93% complete. Phase 0 of the pipeline test will start at the beginning of next year, according to the project's general manager.Phase 0 starts from the Turkey-Georgia frontier and ends in Turkey's Eskisehir province where compressor stations are being constructed. The second part of the project, called Phase 1 is established from Eskisehir and continues to the Ipsala district of Edirne on the Turkey-Greece border, where TANAP will be linked to the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), a pipeline that will provide Azeri gas to European markets.

Saltuk Duzyol, TANAP's general manager declared: "All works for Phase 0 will be completed by the end of this year. Then, the first test gas will be delivered into the pipeline, and first commercial gas will be pumped into the pipeline in June 2018. We will have six months to do all the technical testing,".
 
TANAP's initial capacity per year is estimated at 16 billion cubic meters from which Turkey will extract 6 billion cubic meters, while the rest of 10 billion cubic meters will be transported to Europe. 

Duzyol further said: "The slump in global oil prices and low commodity prices also gives the TANAP project an opportunity to shrink its budget and save up to $3.8 billion. Initially, the investment budget for TANAP was estimated at $11.7 billion."
 
TANAP's general manager affirmed that extra financing from international banks would take place with the EBRD's decision. The Southern Gas Corridor Closed Joint Stock Company represents the finance borrower, which is a 58 percent shareholder in TANAP and operates the Republic of Azerbaijan's interest in the project.
