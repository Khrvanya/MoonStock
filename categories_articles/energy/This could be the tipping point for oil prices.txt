  Record oil production meeting a wave of surprisingly strong  demand has reined in world oil prices, creating a delicate  balance that could be tipped either way—and the most  immediate catalyst may be Iran's nuclear talks.  The market has been awaiting the outcome of the negotiations  ahead of a June 30 deadline, as an agreement could put 1 million  barrels of Iranian crude back on the market eventually. U.S.  crude futures have been locked between $57 and $62 per  barrel—since late April.   On Sunday, officials on all sides were quoted as saying the talks  would need to continue beyond the deadline. Disagreement was  reported to remain on inspections and other key issues.  A preliminary agreement was reached two months ago, but since then  it had appeared not enough progress was made. The market had  expected an extension.
