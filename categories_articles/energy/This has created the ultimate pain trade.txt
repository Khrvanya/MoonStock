  The strong blend of macro forces driving commodities lower makes  it unlikely the sector will recover for months to come.  Perhaps the biggest factor has been China, which drove the cycle  through boom and now bust. At the same time, the U.S. Federal  Reserve could start, as early as next week, to normalize interest  rates, which have been at near zero for nearly seven years. That is driving  the dollar higher, which in turn weakens commodities prices.No market has been as widely watched or as influential as oil, the  lifeblood of commerce and the one that is most tethered to  geopolitics, and now tied to movements in the stock, bond and other commodities markets. OPEC gave oil its latest kick down last week by  retaining its year-old policy of letting the market set prices.  West Texas Intermediate crude is now down more than 10 percent since  OPEC's meeting Friday. "I think it's the reality that there is no OPEC savior. In fact, there's no OPEC, for now," said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS.
