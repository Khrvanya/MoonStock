  Oil and the dollar could be keys to Thursday's trading, after the  dynamic duo sent markets on a wild ride Wednesday.  Falling crude prices and the rising dollar have been poison to  the stock market with both sapping corporate profits. But on  Wednesday, stocks moved higher as oil surged, while the dollar  slumped amid speculation the Fed would hold off on further rate  hikes.     "We're all watching each other. I hate these kinds of markets  when you're watching another market to determine what to do,"  said Arthur Bass, managing director at COEX Partners. "I hate  these kinds of markets. You get them periodically, and at some  point they'll decouple."
