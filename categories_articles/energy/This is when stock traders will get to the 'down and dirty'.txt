  Earnings from big tech, industrials and financial firms should  all drive trading in the week ahead, but traders are also watching the fallout from Doha on oil prices.  The meeting in Qatar this weekend between OPEC and non-OPEC oil  producers has been much heralded but was also seen yielding low  results. At best, analysts had expected a loose agreement to freeze  production but the meeting failed to produce an agreement.U.S. oil futures fell five percent Sunday evening, but analysts said the losses could have been steeper if not for a strike in Kuwait that threatens to sharply reduce production. Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The  Lindsey Group said the Doha meeting was important but earnings will drive the market. "To me, it's all about earnings for the next two  weeks. ... Now you get to the down and dirty — the core of  everything going on in the macro world in the first quarter, like  China, and what did that mean for corporate profits."
