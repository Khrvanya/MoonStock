  U.S. refiners could be helping to set the stage for another day  of reckoning for oil prices.  The global crude glut has now turned into a full-fledged glut for  gasoline and diesel fuel as well, even though consumers are using  near-record amounts of fuel. Analysts say refinery production  could be one factor that helps decide in the next several weeks whether crude breaks below its roughly $44 to $50 a barrel range — or can rise above it.  "There's a lot of crude and products out there. If you're purely  looking at crude and we're developing an oversupply of product,  that's going to put downward pressure on the market, which is  going to make crude buying back off, which is going to be bearish.  On top of that, we're just a few weeks away from lower demand due  to planned refinery maintenance," said Michael  Wittner, head of commodities research,  Americas of Societe Generale.   Refiners have been producing near-record amounts of gasoline, and  in the past week, U.S. refineries were running at 92.3 percent of  capacity. Later in the summer, refineries begin to go into  maintenance season to prepare for winter fuel season, creating  less demand for crude.
