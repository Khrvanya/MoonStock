  Crude oil prices are down this week as uncertainties over China's  economic growth and oversupply continue to weigh on investors.  Oil is now down more than 10 percent from its October high of  $50.92, and according to one expert, a "pile up" of bearish  factors this week could spark the next leg lower.  "A meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC oil producing countries on  Wednesday should end in disarray, leading to another round of  selling," John Kilduff told CNBC's "Futures Now" on Tuesday. OPEC  is hosting a special technical meeting on Wednesday, and while  Kilduff expects it to be a nonevent, he does suspect it could  result in "more protestation from Venezuela and countries getting  hurt the worst," which will continue to put pressure on the  commodity.   Furthermore, Kilduff anticipates this week's EIA inventory report  to show another "substantial" number. "You're going to get a big  crude inventory build in the weekly report. That's going to be a  downward catalyst," said the CNBC contributor.   Read More  Moody's downgrade 2016 oil prices estimates  Nonetheless, crude oil has been on a considerable run of late.  The commodity is up more than 22 percent from its Aug. 24 low.  But for Kilduff, oil's recent rally to $50 a barrel was nothing  but a "bull trap" on the charts.   "We're going to punch through that $44 support," said the Again  Capital partner. "I think we break that [support] and definitely  take a trip into the $30s."   Of course, Kilduff has been an oil bear for some time, at one  point calling for it to fall as low as $25 a barrel — crude bottomed at  just under $38 a barrel late August — and while he does say  that call has "lower probability," it's still within realm. "It's  going lower," he added.   Crude oil closed Tuesday at $45.55, less than 1 percent  lower.
