  Crude prices have surged on hopes that OPEC and Russia may reach  a deal to curtail output, but oil futures could fall to new lows  as soon as next week, said Ed Morse, Citigroup's global head of  commodities research.  "It's always tough to call a bottom, but you know we tested the  mid-20 range a couple weeks ago. I don't see why that's not  likely to happen again over the next few months," Morse told  CNBC's "Fast Money: Halftime Report" on Wednesday.  Morse was one of the first analysts to correctly forecast oil  falling into the $20s, and he sees three reasons why it could  push even lower than U.S. crude's intraday low of $26.19 last  week.  First, Iran could increase crude exports as soon as next week,  adding to a market that is oversupplied by about 1.5 million  barrels a day.   Tehran intends to bring an additional 500,000 barrels per day to  market as soon as possible.  Second, crude inventories are building, and as producers run out  of space to store their product, pricing pressures will come into  play. On Wednesday, the EIA reported U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 8.4 million  barrels in the previous week, pushing total oil in storage to a record high.   And finally, economic growth is raising red flags for demand,  particularly in China, where expansion slowed to a 25-year low of  6.9 percent in 2015.  "If recent data from China continue in the same vein, that will  mean that demand will play an equal role to supply in dragging  prices down," Morse said.As for speculation about production cuts from OPEC and non-OPEC members, Morse said it's important to note that no Saudi sources have yet indicated that the kingdom, the world's top oil exporter, is on board.
