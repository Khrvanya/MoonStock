  Three countries responsible for more than half of OPEC's planned  production cuts exported at or near records through the end of 2016,  according to Matt Smith, director of commodity research at  tanker-tracking firm ClipperData.  Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have pledged to  reduce their combined output by 756,000 barrels a day from  October levels. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting  Countries in November agreed to take 1.2 million barrels a day  off the market in a bid to reduce huge stockpiles of crude that have built up in recent years.More than two years of low oil prices sparked a battle for market share  among OPEC members. Record-high export levels through the end of  2016 show that battle continued to the very last day of the  year, Smith said.  "Really, these guys have been going hell for leather here, pedal  to the metal, before screeching to a halt as they try to reach  compliance," Smith told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Wednesday,  days after the output cuts went into effect.  To be sure, many analysts see Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE as  among the most likely to adhere to the agreed-upon cuts.  Still, the three countries will likely have to cut their  exports meaningfully if they are to achieve their promised production cuts, Smith told CNBC.  Market watchers will get OPEC's official report on December  output in two weeks, and the cartel's compliance committee meets  Jan. 21 and 22 to assess how well members are adhering to the  cuts. Export levels will provide an important litmus test for  compliance throughout OPEC's planned cuts in the first half of  2017, Smith said.  "It's the most transparent way we have to see if they're adhering  to the production cuts, given they depend upon these exports for  revenues," he said. "They would be the last thing to be cut."
