Natural GasFrench oil major Total has started up production from the Culzean gas condensate field located on Block 22/25a, 230 kilometers off the coast of Aberdeen, in the UK.Announcing the field start-up on Tuesday, Total said that, with a plateau production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), Culzean will account for around 5% of the UK's gas consumption, bringing to 18% the proportion of the country's gas demand supplied by Total.
 
Discovered in 2008 by Maersk Oil, the Culzean field contains resources estimated between 250 and 300 million barrels of oil equivalent. The project includes the drilling of six wells, the construction of three bridge-linked platforms and of a Floating Storage and Offloading (FSO) unit. Gas from Culzean is exported via the CATS pipeline and the UK National Grid whilst condensate is stored in the FSO for offloading by shuttle tanker.
 
Total operates Culzean with a 49.99% participating interest, alongside BP (32%) and JX Nippon (18.01%).
