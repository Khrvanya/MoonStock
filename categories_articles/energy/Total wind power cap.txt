WindThe total capacity of all wind turbines installed worldwide reached 539,291 megawatts (MW) by the end of 2017, as state in the World Wind Energy Association (WWEA) report.According to initial statistics presented by the WWEA, over 52,552 MW of capacity was added in 2017, or a little bit more than in 2016, when 51,402 MW were sent to the grid.

Still the growth rate in 2017 represents 10.8 percent, the lowest increase ever since the industrial distribution of wind turbines, which began at the end of the 20th century.

The report revealed that all wind facilities installed by the end of 2017 can meet the demand of more than 5 percent of the global electricity consumers.

In 2017, Denmark established a new world record, having 43 percent of its power generated from wind. Additionally, by far the biggest wind power market was China, which added 19 GW of capacity, slightly less than in 2016, and continues to be the top wind power production country, with an overall wind capacity accounting for 188 GW.

Stefan Gsanger, WWEA secretary general, affirmed: "New world regions such as Latin America and most recently also Africa are playing an important role in this dynamic development." Also, he iterated that solid growth of wind power on the world scale, which goes alongside with further geographic diversifications is very hopeful.
