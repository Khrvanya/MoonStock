"In the near-term, we certainly had some uncertainty," said Tim  Evans, an energy futures specialist at Citi Futures. "But  Venezuela elects their leaders democratically. This matter will  be decided at the polls."  Evans said he doesn't expect a dramatic shift in Venezuelan production  any time soon.

Jeff Kilburg of KKM Financial trades crude oil along with other  commodities, and he concurs with that sanguine view.   "Lots of people talk about a big type of change coming," Kilburg  said, "but I definitely don't think it's a major market  mover."  Crude oil futures added about twenty cents in the twenty minutes  after the news broke.What are energy futures doing now?
