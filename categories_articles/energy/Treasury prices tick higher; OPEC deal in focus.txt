  U.S. government debt prices were higher on Monday as investors  assessed the possibility of OPEC agreeing to a production cut  this week.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury notes, which moves  inversely to price, was lower at around 2.31 percent, while the  yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also lower at 2.98 percent. U.S. crude settled at $47.08 a barrel, up 2.21 percent, after Dow Jones reported  the Iraqi oil minister said Iraq will cooperate with other OPEC  members to reach a deal. OPEC members are holding bilateral  meetings as they try to reach an agreement at a general meeting  on Wednesday.  Oil prices had traded lower earlier on Monday after Libya's  National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Sunday it would not take  part in any OPEC production cuts for the "foreseeable future",  according to Reuters, and the Saudi Arabian Energy Minister  Khalid al-Falih also said that he believed the oil market would  balance itself next year even if producers did not  intervene.   On the data front, the Dallas Fed manufacturing survey rose to 8.8 in November from 6.7 in October.
