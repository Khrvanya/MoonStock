  U.S. government debt prices were mostly flat on Tuesday as  investors digested the latest release of U.S. economic data and  comments from Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell.  The case for a rate hike has clearly strengthened since the  central bank's last meeting, Powell said in prepared remarks at an event in Washington,  D.C.  While Powell said he thinks that the Fed's patience in raising  rates has paid dividends, he warned that moving too slowly could  eventually mean that the Federal Open Market Committee would have  to abruptly tighten policy to avoid overshooting its goals.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury notes, which moves  inversely to price, was roughly flat near 2.306 percent, while the  yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was slightly lower at 2.951 percent.  Revised third-quarter gross domestic  product (GDP) data showed the U.S. economy grew at  an annualized rate of 3.2  percent. Other data released Tuesday included the  S&P Core Logic Case-Shiller index, which showed U.S. home prices gained  5.5 percent in September. The Consumer confidence index  for November came in at  107.1, well above expectations.  Economic data has been at the forefront for investors as they  brace themselves for a possible interest rate hike from the  Federal Reserve next month. According to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, market  expectations for a December rate hike are above 95 percent.  In oil markets, U.S. crude settled down 3.9 percent at $45.23 a barrel.  Oil prices slipped on Tuesday after investors viewed the leading  oil exporters to be struggling to agree a deal to cut production  in an attempt to reduce global supply, according to a Reuters  report. OPEC is set to meet in Vienna, Austria on Wednesday and  traders will be keeping a close eye on announcements regarding an  oil production cut. In September, OPEC had outlined a deal to cut  output by approximately 1 million barrels per day.
