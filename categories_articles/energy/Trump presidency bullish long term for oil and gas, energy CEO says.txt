  While there are some specifics about President-elect Donald  Trump's energy policy to be worked out, overall his  presidency is "very bullish long term for oil and gas," Warwick  Energy CEO Kate Richard told CNBC on Thursday.   Trump has said he wants to roll back regulations and produce more  energy, which he believes will create more wealth for  America.   Richard thinks Trump's economic plan could probably spur  economic growth and demand for oil.   "I think the market loves Republican administrations and  infrastructure is very bullish for crude and natural gas demand,"  she said in an interview with "Power Lunch."  Trump has promised a massive infrastructure spending  program, saying in his victory speech early Wednesday morning  he's going to fix highways bridges, tunnels, airports, schools  and hospitals — and put millions of people to work to get it  done.  While Richard believes Trump's energy policy is "interesting,"  she noted the whole story can't be put together yet.   For one, she said talk about repealing Environmental  Protection Agency regulations are a little hard to  understand.   "We haven't seen a decline in drilling in this country because of  EPA regulations. We've seen a decline in drilling in this country  because of two years of low prices," she said.   Right now, Richard thinks there are other things that are more  important for the energy industry.   "For natural gas: winter. And for crude: OPEC and the OPEC  meeting at the end of November. And both of those are bullish for  the commodities which are probably bullish for the equities." — CNBC's John Schoen contributed to this report.
