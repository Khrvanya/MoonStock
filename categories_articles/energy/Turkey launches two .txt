RenewableTwo new biomass power plants with an overall capacity of 17.2 megawatts (MW) started operating in Turkey's Aegean city of Aydin and in the southeastern city of Sanliurfa.The company said that the plant in Aydin will utilize cotton straws left after harvesting to produce 12 megawatts of installed power capacity. 

Initially, the plant will produce 80 million-kilowatt hours of electricity per year, enough to meet the demand of almost 30 thousand households, with the potential of doubling this capacity next year.

The biomass plant in Sanliurfa with an installed capacity of 5.2 megawatts will use agricultural biomass and animal waste to produce electricity, supplying the needs of almost 15 thousand households. The company also noted that its yearly production capacity is set to be 35 million kilowatt-hours.
 
Mehmet Kutman, the Chairman of Global Investment Holdings declared: "It is possible to produce above 5 thousand megawatts of electricity from biomass in Turkey. Turkey holds great potential in this field as the country has wide agricultural land and livestock. We will extend the electricity production from biomass in Turkey, which is very widespread abroad. Our subsidiary Consus Energy's activities in this field will develop quickly and substantially."

Atay Arpaciogullari, Consus Energy's CEO, confirmed its intentions to invest roughly $400 million in biomass for bringing 250 megawatts of installed capacity online by 2020.

If expected investments will be completed, the firm representatives aim to produce 1.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity every year.
