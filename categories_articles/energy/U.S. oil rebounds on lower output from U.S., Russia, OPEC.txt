Saudi Arabia pumped about 9.78 million bpd in August.Russia's output declined to 11.24 million bpd in Sept. 1-29, down from 11.29 million bpd in the previous month, sources said, although it's still above the quotas set in an output deal between Russia and OPEC.U.S. crude oil output fell 276,000 bpd in July to 11.81 million bpd as federal offshore Gulf of Mexico production slid, according to a U.S. Energy Information Administration monthly report released on Monday.Output at the world's biggest oil producer peaked at 12.12 million bpd in April.Oil prices are likely to remain steady, with Brent averaging $65.19 a barrel and WTI $57.96 in 2019, as flagging demand outweighs supply shocks, a separate Reuters survey showed.
