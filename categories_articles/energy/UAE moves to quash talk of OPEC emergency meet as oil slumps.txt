The United Arab  Emirates moved to quash talk of a potential emergency meeting of the Organization of the  Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) after Nigeria's oil minister said on Tuesday a  "couple" of members had requested a gathering. Benchmark  slipped  towards $30 a barrel to a near 12-year low before rising  slightly. They have shed almost three-quarters of their value  since mid-2014 due to oversupply.        Such market conditions supported an emergency meeting to  review whether OPEC should change strategy, Nigerian Minister of  State for Petroleum Resources Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu told  reporters on the sidelines of an energy conference in Abu  Dhabi.       However, UAE Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed  al-Mazroui later told the same conference the current OPEC  strategy was working, adding that time was needed to allow this  to happen -- perhaps between one and 1-1/2 years.       "I'm not convinced OPEC alone can change or can  solely unilaterally change this strategy just because we have  seen a low in the market," Mazroui said.        Mazroui added that while the first half of 2016  would be "tough" for the oil market, there would be a gradual  recovery later in the year, aided by an expected drop in non-OPEC  production.   The Nigerian minister did not specify which OPEC members wanting  a meeting and said any such gathering would be in February or  March. OPEC's next scheduled meeting is not until June 2.       But two OPEC delegates from outside the Gulf were  sceptical an emergency conference would take place. "There won't  be any meeting," said one of the OPEC delegates from an African  OPEC country.    OPEC's strategy of maintaining production levels, instead  of reducing supply to allow prices to recover, has been aimed at  defending market share at the expense of higher-cost producers  such as those in the U.S. shale sector.       The supply glut is likely to be exacerbated in 2016  by the return of Iranian supply to the market, once Western  sanctions have been lifted.       "I think all the members including Iran have the  right to increase their production. I don't think we are going to  restrict anyone," Mazroui said.       Such prospects have led oil analysts to downgrade  their forecasts in recent days, with Standard Chartered saying  prices could drop to $10 a barrel.     The likelihood of a meeting taking place will hinge  on the attitude of OPEC heavyweight Saudi Arabia, which has been  at the vanguard of resistance to a production cut.       "Saudi Arabia has never held the position that it  does not want to talk," Kachikwu said. "In fact, it was very  supportive of a meeting before June, at the time when we held the  December meeting, if (there was a) consensus call for it."
