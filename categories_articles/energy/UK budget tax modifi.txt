Oil MarketThe trade association for the oil and gas industry has declared that the Autumn Budget could save millions of pounds by presenting a tax change to postpone the decommissioning of older energy fields.Oil & Gas UK states that the government has a reduced capability to permit tax history to be transmitted from seller to puchaser when shares in the North Sea are sold on. 

It considers that this would attract new funding, stimulate signing of more agreements involving late life assets and extend the life of mature fields.

The company thinks that the modification in tax legislation could save the Treasury around PS10 million per asset on average, with field life potentially being prolonged by almost five years.

Deirdre Michie, Chief Executive of Oil & Gas UK, said: "Mature assets are attracting interest from investors who see the competitive opportunity that the UK Continental Shelf continues to offer. However, the current tax position is proving to be a blocker to potential deals and that is why it is important that Her Majesty's Treasury acts to facilitate and support further deals."
