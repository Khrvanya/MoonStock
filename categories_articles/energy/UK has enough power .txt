Electricity MarketNational Grid predicts a surplus power margin rate reaching 10.3% this winter.  
According to the grid operator's Winter Outlook Report for 2017/18, it is an increase from 5.7% from last winter. It added that there will be enough power generation and imports to satisfy the demand.

The top transmission demand, which occurs mainly on cold, dark days in winter and during the tea time, is predicted to hit 50.7GW. Gas demand is likely to be lower compared to last winter at 51.4 billion cubic meters this winter, principally due to a potential reduction of gas for power generation.

Phil Sheppard, Director of UK System Operator stated: "The forecast surplus margin for this winter is 10.3%. this is the additional power we expect to have available over and above what is needed to manage anticipated electricity demand. The margin has increased from last year which is encouraging as we enter the first main delivery year of the Capacity Market."

Energy markets and prices will be discussed at Energy Live Expo on 2nd November at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre (QEII) in London.
