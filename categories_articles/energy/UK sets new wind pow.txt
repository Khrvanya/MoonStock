WindWinter storm Ciara has helped the UK set a new wind power generation record last Saturday, when the renewable energy covered 56% of the country's electricity demand, Kallanish Energy reports.The storm battered Britain with heavy rain and winds of up to 100 miles per hour over the weekend.
 
According to data from utility Drax Group, wind power generation supplied as much as 14,880 megawatts (MW) to the national grid early Saturday. Overall on that day, wind generation from both onshore and offshore farms supplied 44.26% of the British demand, or 13,950 MW - beating the Dec. 9, 2019, record.
 
On Feb. 8, nuclear power accounted for an 18.40% share of demand and gas for 17.73%. Both energy sources are the backbone of power supply in a post-coal UK.
 
Data from the National Grid's Electricity System Operator (ESO) showed 2019 saw the highest levels of wind and solar generation ever recorded in the UK. Great Britain's reliance on fossil fuels hit an all-time low last year, as coal power plants were shut down.
 
ESO director Fintan Slye said last December the UK electricity system is "changing quickly," towards the country's target of net-zero emissions by 2050. National Grid is seeking carbon free operations by 2025.
