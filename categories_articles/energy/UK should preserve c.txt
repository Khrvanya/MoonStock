NuclearThe Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee recommended the UK Government to preserve as close partnership possible with EU's nuclear association after Brexit.BEIS mentions that connections with Euratom should be maintained to guarantee the continuation of the existing nuclear safeguards, as well as to reduce risks of disruption to ongoing research in the field.

The Committee averted that a deal without result would be very risky for the UK's civil nuclear sector because it can lead to country's incapability to transport, trade or otherwise access materials and equipment needed to keep operating the country's nuclear power plants.

Rachel Reeves MP, BEIS Committee Chair, affirmed: "The government should, as a matter of urgency, be seeking to retain as close as possible an association with Euratom and secure its ongoing delivery of existing safeguards requirements in the UK. Any delay will increase investment in contingency arrangements which may ultimately not be required."
