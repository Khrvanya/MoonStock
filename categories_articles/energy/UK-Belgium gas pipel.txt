Natural GasGas flows between Britain and Belgium through the IUK pipeline could be interrupted this winter if electricity supply issues facing Belgium require the pipeline operator to turn off its electricity-driven compressors, it said on Thursday.Belgium faces a struggle to meet power demand this winter after six of its ageing seven nuclear reactors are closed for repairs.
 
Its grid operator Elia has warned it may have to ration electricity during the high-demand winter months, while fears of a supply shortage that could see lights go out and trains stand still have pushed power prices to record highs.
 
IUK said that if there is a very tight power market in Belgium it could be asked to cut its electricity at the compressor site to zero during three hours per day and in exceptional circumstances twice a day during three consecutive hours.
 
As a result, IUK said it would only market 70 percent of its gas flow capabilities as firm capacity during Q4 2018 and Q1 2019 and would offer the remaining 30 percent capacity on an interruptible basis.
