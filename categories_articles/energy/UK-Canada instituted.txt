CoalGreat Britain and Canada have launched a global coalition to put an end to the high exploitation of coal.25 countries and states have so far joined the 'Powering Past Coal Alliance' to reduce coal from power generation before 2030 at the UN COP23 climate conference in Bonn. Among the nations are Austria, Belgium, Costa Rica, Fiji, France, New Zealand, Ontario, Switzerland and Washington.

Several global huge coal consumers like China, Germany, Russia and the US have not yet joined the alliance.

As members of the alliance, the countries are obliged to fix coal reduction goals and promise not to invest anymore in coal power generation in their state or abroad. 

To provide technical and practical aid to hasten the transition away from coal, the nations will work with businesses, civil society and governments.

UK Climate Change Minister Claire Perry declared: "Reducing global coal consumption should be a vital and urgent priority for all countries and states. Unabated coal is the dirtiest, most polluting way of generating electricity. The Powering Past Coal Alliance will signal to the world that the time of coal has passed. The UK is committed to completely phasing out unabated coal-fired power generation no later than 2025 and we hope to inspire others to follow suit."
