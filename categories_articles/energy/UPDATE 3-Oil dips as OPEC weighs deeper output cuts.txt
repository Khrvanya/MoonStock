Brent surged 3.6% on Wednesday.West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 21 cents, or 0.34%, to $58.23 a barrel. They settled up 4.2% on Wednesday.The OPEC+ group has been curbing output since 2017 to counter surging production from the United States, which is now the world's biggest oil producer thanks to a rapid growth in shale oil output.Next year, rising production in other non-OPEC countries such as Brazil and Norway threatens to add to the glut."We expect a constructive outcome to todays meeting in terms of a prolongation of the deal, but are not yet convinced that a strong bullish surprise with a sizeable adjustment to the target level will really transpire," Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy said in a note.Oil prices surged on Wednesday on expectations of deeper OPEC cuts and data showing a large drop in U.S. crude inventories last week.Prices are, however, roughly where they were a week ago, before they plunged on a lack of progress on resolving a 17-month-old Sino-U.S. trade war that has hit weakened global economies and dented demand growth for oil.U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday described trade talks with China as going "very well", a day after saying it could take until after next year's presidential election to complete an agreement.(Additional reporting by Aaron Sheldrick; Editing by Tom Hogue and Mark Potter)
