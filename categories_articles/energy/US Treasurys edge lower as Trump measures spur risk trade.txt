  U.S. government debt prices were lower on Wednesday as riskier  assets regained their appeal, while investors digested a Treasury  Department sale.   The Treasury Department auctioned $34 billion in five-year notes  at a high yield of 1.988 percent.   The bid-to-cover ratio, an indicator of demand, was 2.38.  Indirect bidders, which include major central banks, were awarded  63.3 percent. Direct bidders, which includes domestic money  managers, bought 4.6 percent.  "The 5 yr note auction was on the softer side," said Peter  Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note.  "With the auction weakness with respect to the yield on top of an  already weak Treasury market today has yields across the curve at  the (high) of the day in response."  The five-year Treasury note yield traded around 1.992 percent  following the sale.   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury notes, which moves  inversely to price, was higher at around 2.519 percent, while the  yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also higher at 3.103 percent.   Treasurys also fell on Tuesday after President Donald Trump  signed several key executive orders.  In economic news, the FHFA House Price index rose 0.5 percent in  November. Mortgage rates, meanwhile, rose 4 percent last week.   In oil markets, prices edged lower after the Energy Information  Administration said U.S. crude barrels rose by 2.8 billion. Brent crude traded at around $55.18 a barrel on  Wednesday, down 0.47 percent, while U.S. crude was  around $52.81 a barrel, down 0.70 percent.
