  U.S. oil futures closed below the psychologically important $50  level—possibly signaling more declines to come and a retest  of the March lows. West Texas  Intermediate settled down $1.67 at $49.19 per barrel, the  first close below $50 since April 2. U.S. government data  Wednesday showed a bearish increase in crude inventories last  week of 2.5 million barrels, slightly more than expected. The  stronger dollar was also a negative.   Some strategists say the latest move down could be setting oil up  for a run at the March low, just above $42 per barrel. But crude  could also temporarily stay trapped in a range on both sides of  $50, suspended by the pull of heavy refining demand and the  pressure from increased supply from Saudi Arabia and Iraq.

There may be some short covering ... but it looks like another  move lower is at hand, and the March lows are very much in  focus," said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital.
