  Oil prices fell 4 percent on Friday, paring weekly gains, on a  report that Saudi Arabia did not expect an agreement at talks  next week among major crude exporters aimed at freezing  production.  Crude futures slumped after Bloomberg reported that Saudi Arabia  did not expect a decision at Algiers, the capital of Algeria  where the biggest oil producers are expected to convene next week  for talks, traders said. Bloomberg cited a "delegate" as source,  said traders who saw the report.  U.S. oil drilling rig count was up on Friday by 2 to 418,  according to Baker Hughes. Brent crude oil was down $1.67,  or 3.5 percent, at $45.98 a barrel by 2:41 p.m. ET. For the week,  it was up 1.6 percent. U.S. West Texas  Intermediate (WTI) crude was down $1.76, or 3.8 percent,  at $44.56. On the week, WTI showed a gain of less than 5 percent.  Earlier in the session, Brent and WTI were headed for their  largest weekly gain in more than a month, reacting to a Reuters  report that Saudi Arabia has offered to reduce production if  rival Iran caps its own output this year. The Reuters report was  based on sources who were familiar with discussions between the  two sides.  Traders and investors were also awaiting a U.S. oil rig count  report to ascertain if more drillers were returning to the well  pad in the world's largest oil consumer. The weekly report by oil  services firm Baker Hughes, due at 1:00 p.m. ET had shown rig  additions in twelve out of the last 13 weeks.
