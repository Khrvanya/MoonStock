WindVestas Wind Systems announced last week it has received orders for 462 MW of wind turbines to be installed at wind farms in Norway, Sweden and Denmark.The largest deal relates to several wind projects in Norway with 328 MW of combined capacity. Vestas will supply different 4 MW platform turbine variants that are tailormade for the specific wind conditions. The order also features a VestasOnline Business SCADA solution as well as a five-year Active Output Management (AOM) 5000 service agreement. Installations are planned for 2020 and 2021.
 
As part of another contract, awarded by Fred. Olsen Renewables, Vestas will supply 25 of its V150-4.2 MW wind turbines totalling 105 MW for the Hogalind project in Sweden. The deal also includes a two-year AOM 4000 service agreement.
 
The Danish contract comes from local utility NRGi Renewables A/S and concerns the 29-MW repowering of the Tagmark wind park in Thisted municipality. Vestas will replace the six existing V66-1.75 MW turbines at the site with eight V117-3.45 MW turbines delivered in 3.6 MW optimised mode. This will more than double Tagmark's annual energy production. The particular project was secured in Denmark's first energy-neutral auction held this past November.
 
Delivery of the turbines for the Danish project is expected in the third quarter of 2019 and the start of commercial operations is planned for the final three months of the year.
