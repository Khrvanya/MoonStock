WindVoltalia has secured a new 60MW project in Brazil won during the auctions organized by the Brazilian regulator ANEEL."After a series of new power sales contracts signed in 2017 and 2018, including last week's win of a new contract for 60 MW in Brazil, our 1 GW target of installed capacity is now fully secured. To reach this ambitious target, we have relied on our historical strengths, including our teams in Brazil and France, and on our more recent teams covering Africa. The acquisition of Martifer Solar was an accelerator in this process. While the 1 GW milestone is an important step in Voltalia's young history, I am now excited about all the other opportunities I see ahead of us" comments Sebastien Clerc, Chief Executive Officer of Voltalia.
 
Eight months after winning the VSM project (163 MW1 ), Voltalia secures a new 60 MW wind project, named VSM 2 (Ventos da Serra do Mel 2). The new sales contract was won during the national auctions organized on August 31 by the Brazilian regulator ANEEL. It will run for 20 years and will start on January 1, 2024.
 
As for most of Voltalia's projects in Brazil, construction will be accelerated. Between start of operations, which will occur during the second semester of 2020, and until the long-term power sales contract begins in 2024, production will be sold on the free market mainly through short-term private power sales agreements already secured at a price more than 60% higher than the 20-year contract price.
