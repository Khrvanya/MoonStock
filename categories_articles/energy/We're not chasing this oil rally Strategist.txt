There's a big question mark around the magnitude of the oil rally continuing into spring, despite momentum behind rising U.S. crude  prices, a strategist told CNBC on Monday.   "I still think there's some fundamental issues that will pose  problems for this rally to continue, and I really think there's a  fear of missing out," Chris Kettenmann, chief energy  strategist at Macro Risk Advisors, said on "Power Lunch."   Oil prices surged more than 6 percent Monday amid reports  of falling U.S. shale output and talk of communication between OPEC and noncartel countries.   But even if supplies fall for crude, refined petroleum  products like gasoline are likely to keep having a  glut, Kettenmann said. And much of the market's hope is  contingent on Iran's cooperation in talks — something  Kettenmann thinks is ultimately unlikely.   While it might be natural to think that oil prices will affect  the renewable energy sector, he said that category has been doubling down on its productivity for a while to compete with natural gas and coal. "We think it's set up for a nice attractive entry point," Kettenmann said.
