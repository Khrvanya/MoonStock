  After a rip-roaring week, Wall Street should be in better spirits  when it gets back to work Tuesday, as traders watch to see if  markets can hold recent lows.  China's mainland markets reopen after a week hiatus Monday, and  that could stir things up if selling there intensifies. Hong  Kong's market sold off in the past week when it reopened  after a three-day new year holiday.   In the U.S., selling reached a crescendo Thursday with both  stocks and oil hitting January lows, before erasing losses. Both  markets rallied hard on Friday with the  bouncing  nearly 2 percent, and West Texas Intermediate crude up more than  12 percent on the day.
