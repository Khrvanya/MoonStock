Oil MarketNorwegian oil and gas giant Equinor has shown huge confidence in the potential of the West of Shetland area by striking a deal to buy in to Rosebank, which it described as one of the biggest undeveloped finds on the UK Continental Shelf.Rosebank lies about 80 miles north west of Shetland and is estimated to contain around 300 million barrels oil.

Equinor has agreed to buy the 40 per cent interest in Rosebank held by America's Chevron, which is shifting investment from the North Sea to America's shale fields.

But Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, has signalled it is considering a massive investment in the field.

"We have a proven track record of high value field developments across the North Sea and will now be able to deploy this experience on a new project in the UK," said Al cook, vice president of global strategy and business development and UK country manager at Equinor.

The company is developing the 320 million barrel Mariner heavy oil field East of Shetland, which is due onstream this year.

Experts at Wood Mackenzie oil and gas consultancy reckon it could cost more than $6 billion to install all the facilities required to produce oil from Rosebank.
