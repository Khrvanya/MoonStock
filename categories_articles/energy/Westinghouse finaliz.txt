NuclearWestinghouse accomplished a major decommissioning project at the former Barseback nuclear power plant in Skane, Sweden.Barseback's unit 2 is not functional since 2005, while the decommissioning work commenced in August 2016.
 
Westinghouse's decommissioning goal lies in underwater segmentation and packaging of the reactor vessel internals, as well as the upfront engineering researches and equipment manufacturing and qualification.

Westinghouse is now ready for decommissioning work on Barseback unit 1 and intends to accomplish it in April 2019.

Barseback is an ABB-designed boiling water reactor (BWR) plant located in the south of Sweden, 30 kilometers from Malmo. The first reactor, Barseback 1, ended its operation on November 30, 1999, and the second, Barseback 2, became non-functional on May 31, 2005.

Both units of the 600-megawatt boiling-water-reactors were put on stream in 1975 and 1977, respectively.
