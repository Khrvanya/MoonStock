  Markets will likely move higher as monetary policy pumps up  stocks in Japan, China, and Europe, but there's greater risk  heading into 2015, Jeff Kleintop, chief global investment  strategist at Charles Schwab, told CNBC on Monday.  Europe in particular is facing a "Weekend at Bernie's" situation,  he told "Squawk on the Street."  "Certainly with a lot of central bank action, it may look like  the Eurozone economy is alive, but on closer inspection the heart  stopped beating a while ago," he said.  In the near term, stimulus will lift stocks, but there is only  so much central bank action can do in a frozen environment, he  said.

He said the good news is the market is in a range of reasonableness in terms of valuation,  but cautioned that it's moving to the high end of that range.

Kleintop said emerging markets stand to benefits from the  liquidity central banks are pumping into the market. He suggested  barbelling portfolios to keep core exposure in the United States,  focus on emerging markets while overlooking much of the developed  world.  The economic backdrop is much better for emerging markets, and  while some may be on life support, the heart is still beating, he  said.
