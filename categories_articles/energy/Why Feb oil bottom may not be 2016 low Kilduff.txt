  The low of the year for U.S. crude prices may not be in yet, oil  expert John Kilduff said Wednesday.  On CNBC's "Squawk Box," he said Sunday's meeting in Qatar  of OPEC and non-OPEC producers on a possible output freeze was "one  big joke" because of all the conflicting commentary from the  various oil ministers.  "This is going to be the mother of all 'buy the rumor sell the  news' events here on Sunday. I think there's no way they come  across with any kind of a deal or sufficient rhetoric to satisfy  this rally right now," Kilduff said. "I think there will be a  pullback starting next week."  West Texas Intermediate crude, the American benchmark, bottomed  on Feb. 11 at $26.05 per barrel. Since then, WTI has soared  more than 50 percent — nearly 4.5 percent on Tuesday alone.  The pieces are in place for oil to take another downturn, Kilduff  said, citing concerns about the global economic growth and  massive glut.Kilduff pointed to last week's International Monetary Fund downgrade of its world growth  forecast.  On the oversupply side, "we're still overproducing about a  million barrels a day more than we need. And I think this is  going to dawn on this market," said Kilduff, founding partner  of Again Capital, an alternative investment manager specializing  energy and metals.
