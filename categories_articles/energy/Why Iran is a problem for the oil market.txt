  An Iranian oil tanker, moored at the port of Assaluyeh for more  than a year, set sail for South Korea last week, heralding a new period  of uncertainty for world crude prices.  The global oil market, already suffering a supply glut, has been  anticipating the arrival of Iranian crude for months, and now  that sanctions against its nuclear program have been lifted, Iran is  free to sell more of its oil into a market already oversupplied  by 1.5 million barrels or more a day.   At the same time, neighboring Iraq promises to produce even more  than its current 3.7 million to 3.8 million barrels a day, a recent record. Reports that Iraq could produce more than 4 million barrels  a day weighed on energy prices Monday. West Texas Intermediate  crude fell 5.8 percent to $30.34 per barrel.
