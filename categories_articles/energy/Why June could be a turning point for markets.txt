  Even beyond talk of a "June swoon," an unusual number of major events makes this month a critical time  for markets.  From this week's European Central Bank meeting, to OPEC's Friday  meeting and the G-7 over the weekend, the month is  packed with events—not least of which is the Fed's June 16 and  17 meeting. Greece has a payment due to the IMF on Friday, and that has added a level of tension to markets this week.

"It has the potential to do the most damage."
