  Even in a Thanksgiving holiday lull, financial markets are  gearing up for a week of drama.  "Next week could be one of the most important weeks of the whole  year," said Marc Chandler, head of foreign exchange strategy at  Brown Brothers Harriman. While U.S markets were closed for the  Thanksgiving holiday Thursday, stocks were mixed Friday morning on extreme light volume in a shortened  session. The market focus is already on the  coming week, and for investors worldwide, it's a busy one.  First on Monday, the IMF is expected to grant China's yuan  reserve currency status. The yuan would be included in the fund's Special Drawing Rights basket which, while largely symbolic,  would elevate the currency and China's influence in the global  economy.
