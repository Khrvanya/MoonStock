  Depressed oil prices are likely to rally in the second half of  the year —perhaps as high as $85 per barrel, energy analyst  Michael Rothman said Monday. That said, he added any move higher  won't be a result of coordinated production cuts.  West Texas Intermediate crude tumbled around 5 percent in late morning trade to  under $32 per barrel, as hopes for a deal among OPEC countries and  Russia to reduce  output dwindled. Read MorePickens: Oil already  bottomed—here's what's next  An output cut "was never going to happen, the notion that [OPEC  and Russia] would agree to reduce their output and help support  prices was a nonstarter," said Rothman, founder and president of  the Cornerstone Analytics research firm.  While the bear case seems strong, "prices are not going to stay  this low for an extended period of time," he said. Rothman  believes there are plenty of factors setting up the other side of  the oil trade.   "Most budgets for the OPEC countries can't be maintained at this  level," he continued. "Even the Saudi budget is built on almost  $100 price for breakeven, which is why they've been dipping into  their reserves." So when will the reversal begin?  Rothman told CNBC's "Worldwide Exchange" that $85 per barrel crude is  just a few months away. "We'll actually start to see it when we  get past the winter. We'll see inventories being drawn down,  which most people you're going to talk to aren't expecting," Rothman added.  "That's really the bottom line of where supply and demand meet,"  he said. "I expect that the sentiment is [then] going to  shift."
