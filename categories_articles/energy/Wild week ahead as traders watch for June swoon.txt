  Markets face a barrage of potential catalysts as the month of  June begins, a traditional period of stock market weakness.From Greece's debt talks to a European Central Bank meeting and  Friday's U.S. jobs report, there are plenty of events in the  coming week that could shore up the dollar's gains, change  interest rate expectations and rock equities. OPEC also meets at  the end of the week, and Greece has a debt payment due to the IMF  on Friday.There is an important series of U.S. May economic data, including  ISM manufacturing Monday and auto sales Tuesday, which in  addition to Friday's May jobs report, could help clarify the  strength of the economy and change market perceptions about when  the Fed might start to raise interest rates.
