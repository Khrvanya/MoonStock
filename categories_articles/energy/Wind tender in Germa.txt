WindAnother onshore wind tender in Germany ended with no real competition, awarding just 187 MW of capacity at the ceiling price of EUR 62 (USD 68.4m) per MWh, Germany's Federal Network Agency announced today.The 500-MW tender was again undersubscribed and there is little hope the next one, scheduled for October 1, will attract significant interest.
 
WindPower Europe recently urged Germany to take measures to address the hurdles onshore wind is facing. A major one is the slower and more complex permitting process. In addition, many greenlit projects are stuck due to legal disputes. This leads to undersubscribed auctions as the number of eligible projects able to bid is too low.
 
The September auctions ended with 22 successful bids. North Rhine-Westphalia won four with a combined capacity of 64.2 MW. Six more, of 30.2 MW in total, went to Schleswig-Holstein.
 
Germany is expected to install less than 1.5 GW of onshore wind in 2019, down from an annual average of 4.3 GW over the last five years.
