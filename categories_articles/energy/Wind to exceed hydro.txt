WindAccording to the latest report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), wind power is expected to surpass hydroelectricity as the biggest green energy production source in the US.The study reveals that few new hydro plants are likely to come online in the following two years. It mentions that its forecast is mainly based on water runoff estimations.

The 2017 was a relatively wet year and hydro power offered 7.4% of total utility-scale production. It is likely to reach 6.5% this year and 6.6% next year. 
 
An important capacity of wind should come online this year and in 2019, is likely to raise by 8.3GW and 8GW respectively.

An augmentation of 9% of utility-scale wind capacity by the end of 2018 and another 8% by 2019 can take place if the new generating units would be put on track according to the plan.
 
EIA estimates that wind will provide 6.9% of the overall power production in 2019.
