Since April there has been high activity at the Dvalin field with installation of pipelines and the manifold at 400 m water depth.
 
In August, a 3,500 t processing module was completed and lifted on to the nearby Heidrun platform in preparation for receiving gas from the Dvalin field.
 
Dvalin is being developed as a subsea field tied back to Heidrun, which lies some 15 km to the northwest. 4 wells will be drilled to a depth of around 4,500 m.
