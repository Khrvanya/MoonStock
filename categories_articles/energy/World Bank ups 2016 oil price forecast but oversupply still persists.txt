  The World  Bank's issued its latest set of forecasts for  crude oil prices but interpreting the numbers may depend  on your disposition.  The good news: The World Bank has raised crude oil's price  forecast this year to $43 a barrel from $41 a barrel in its April  assessment.   The bad news: Prices are still expected to end the year lower  compared with current levels. Brent was  trading at $44.80 a barrel Tuesday afternoon in Asia.  The institution noted oil prices jumped over a third in the  second quarter due to supply outages and strong demand, so a fall  in inventories was expected going into the second half  of the year.  "The oil price rebound reflects a number of supply disruptions  that removed up to 2.5 million barrels per day of production at  peak during May and June, with large losses concentrated  in Canada due to wildfires, and  in Nigeria due to militant attacks on oil  infrastructure. In addition, there were disruptions in other  countries, including Kuwait, Iraq, and Libya," added the  World Bank.  Despite a higher forecast compared with the previous estimate,  the prediction still represented a 15 percent decline from 2015  as the fall in excess inventory was partly offset by  new supply coming on-board.The World Bank said production from non-OPEC countries declined,  but OPEC production rose, as Iran  pumped vigorously after Western sanctions against the  country were lifted.  Global demand meanwhile, remained strong, "albeit slowing."  "Downside risks to the energy price forecast include  higher-than-expected output and further weakening in growth (of  emerging market and developing economies). Supply disruptions  among key producers could lead to higher prices," the World Bank  added.  Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.
