WindNorwegian energy giant Statoil declared its Hywind project off Peterhead had surpassed expectations in its first three months of production.According to Statoil, the floating wind farm estimated at PS200 million operated at 65% of its peak capacity between November and January.
During those months, the medium capacity factor for a bottom-fixed array is 45-60%, as stated by the company.

Statoil and the partner of the project Masdar achieved this performance despite having to provisionally turn off the turbines during the period due to difficult weather conditions.

The 30 megawatt wind farm is situated 15miles off the Aberdeenshire coast and capable of providing around 20,000 homes with electricity.

Beate Myking, senior vice-president of offshore wind operations, Statoil, declared: "We have tested the Hywind technology in harsh weather conditions for many years and we know it works. Putting the world's first floating windfarm into production comes with some excitement. Therefore, it is very encouraging to see how well the turbines have performed so far."

Statoil has as target to reduce costs of energy from Hywind over the next 10 to 12 years.
