AGC Reports Historic Construction Spending, China Exports Hit Prices, Metals Index FlatThe monthly Construction MMI(r) registered a value of 89 in March, on par with February's value, reflecting a market still wary of large risks despite the economic recovery, as big projects such as California's high-speed rail expansion continue to lag.A surprise drop in exports swung China's trade balance into deficit last month and amplified fears of a slowdown in the world's No. 2 economy, according to Reuters. Chinese exports fell 18.1 percent in February from a year ago, while the market had been expecting an increase, causing several Chinese metals to trade lower.In a good sign, data from the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC) valued all spending in January at $943 billion, a 9.3 percent rise compared to January 2013. It was the fastest rate of growth for total construction spending since May 2006, the AGC said. The January figure was also up about one-tenth of a percent from December.
