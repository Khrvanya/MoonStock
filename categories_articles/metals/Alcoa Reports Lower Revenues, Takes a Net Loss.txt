Alcoa Reports Lower Revenues, Takes a Net LossThe largest US aluminum producer, Alcoa, reported quarterly revenues of $5.5 billion today. That was lower than the $5.8 billion reported in the first quarter of 2013 due to 8% lower year-over-year aluminum prices. Alcoa said smelting reductions also played a role. Alcoa also said the net loss was a result of an after-tax charge of $276 million associated with special items primarily related to restructuring.
