Aluminum Rises Due to Brazilian Supply; Alcoa, Rusal CutbacksProduction cuts buoyed aluminum Thursday on the LME. In Brazil, aluminum companies producing at the lowest level in 12 years as threats of summer energy rationing shutdowns continue to plague that market. Alcoa Inc. said it will cut output at its smelter in Geelong, Australia, and Russia's UC Rusal, the biggest producer, said its output would fall to the lowest in at least eight years, according to Bloomberg News.
