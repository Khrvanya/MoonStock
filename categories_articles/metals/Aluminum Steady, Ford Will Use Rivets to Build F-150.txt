Aluminum Steady, Ford Will Use Rivets to Build F-150If you want a peek at the daunting manufacturing challenge awaiting Ford to assemble F-150s with aluminum bodies, you need to look at rivets - and many other complex aspects of Range Rover's aluminum-bodied assembly plant in Solihull, England, writes Richard Truett of Automotive News. The 2014 Range Rover body uses 17 types of rivets, 3,722 per vehicle. If one jams in a gun or is inserted incorrectly, production stops. Ford's all-aluminum-body 2015 F-150 will debut later this year. FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering the Aluminum market.
