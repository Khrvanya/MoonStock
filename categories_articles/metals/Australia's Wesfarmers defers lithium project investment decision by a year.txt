Australia's Wesfarmers defers lithium project investment decision by a yearJan 23 (Reuters) - Australia's Wesfarmers Ltd has delayed its final investment decision on the Mt Holland lithium project by a year to the first quarter of 2021, it said on Thursday, as it focuses on cost-cutting amid ongoing weakness in metal prices. The decision follows a review in November of a definitive feasibility study for the project in Western Australia conducted by Covalent Lithium, a joint venture between Wesfarmers and Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile SA.
