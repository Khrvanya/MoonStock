Autodesk Unveils New Sustainable Design Applications at GreenbuildAt the annual Greenbuild International Conference and Expo this week in New Orleans, Autodesk unveiled several new sustainable design applications on Autodesk Labs, the AEC and media software company's testing site.FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering the metals markets of the Construction sector.The new releases include 3 new apps that help building and infrastructure project teams cost-justify sustainability strategies and 2 new apps that bring tighter integration between Building Performance Analysis (BPA) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) workflows for Autodesk Revit and Autodesk FormIt, a mobile conceptual design application."Autodesk's aim is to empower architects and engineers to design and build the highest performing buildings possible by delivering solutions that are intuitive to use and trustworthy," said Emile Kfouri, Director of Building Performance Analysis.Autodesk unveiled 3 new applications that help building and infrastructure project teams explore the cost implications of more efficient designs:Energy Cost Range (ECR), available here on Autodesk Labs, is a single, simple indicator of a project's overall potential energy use range, including comparison to the Architecture 2030 sustainability benchmark, and the key factors that influence it. A flexible new dashboard interface within Revit, called Project Solon (available on Autodesk Labs), allows users to more easily see and better understand the complex interplay of various design factors that affect building performance. Using the stock dashboards provided by Autodesk, a designer's work will be informed by results using a range of predefined building features (wall/roof insulation, glazing, daylight controls) and defaults based on American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Engineers' standards. When more detailed work is required, the designer or an experienced analyst can easily customize the automated simulation settings and deploy custom dashboards for company Revit users.
