Imports of copper ore and concentrate CNC-COPORE-IMP came in at 1.93 million tonnes last month, the General Administration of Customs said, down 10.5% from a record 2.157 million tonnes in November, while aluminium exports rose by 5.8% from the previous month to 478,000 tonnes, the highest since July.
