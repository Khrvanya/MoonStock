China Not Putting More Import Duties on US Silicon… YetIn China, there have been calls to ban imports of polysilicon imported from the US, usually for use in silicon photovoltaic solar panels. Imports into China of polysilicon topped 5,868 tons in May, 84.4% of the total amount of 6,949 ton.FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering the Renewable Energy metals market.China already placed 53.3%-57% anti-dumping duties on imports of polysilicon from the US back in January. Last month, however, the US imposed its own duties on Chinese silicon photovoltaic panels of 18.56%-35.21% set by an initial ruling of the US Department of Commerce.The countermeasure, however, appears to provide little help to China's polysilicon industry, as in the first quarter only a number of leading solar firms managed to remain in the black, with 10 second-tier firms maintaining only 54% of capacity utilization rate and most third-tier firms remaining closed. That is why many in China are calling for even more import duties on US polysilicon. Beijing has so far, turned a blind eye to the calls.US steel plate saw the largest upwards shift on the weekly Renewables MMI(r), rising 2.0 percent to settle at $866.00 per short ton.
