Commerce Dept. Places Duties on Silicon Photovoltaic Solar PanelsThe US Department of Commerce placed duties on imports of crystalline silicon photovoltaic products (including cells, modules, laminates and/or panels) from China. Commerce currently has existing antidumping duty and countervailing duties orders on crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, whether or not assembled into modules, from China. The scope of the investigation, prompted by a complaint from the Oregon-based subsidiary of German company SolarWorld, specifically excludes silicon products covered by the existing AD and CVD orders. Crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells typically form the basic element of solar panels, modules, and/or laminates but can be used in other products as well, including building-integrated photovoltaic walls and roofs.FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering the Renewable Energy metals market.The fight over duties placed manufacturers such as SolarWorld against installers who like the less-expensive Chinese products and can offer customers a cheaper alternative to all-in-one, manufacturer-purchased-and-installed solar panels. Commerce is scheduled to announce its final determination in this investigation on or about August 18, 2014, unless the statutory deadline is extended.
