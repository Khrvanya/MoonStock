Commerce Preliminarily Says Mexico, Turkey Dumped RebarThe Department of Commerce released preliminary findings of its dumping investigation into Mexican and Turkish rebar imports today. Commerce found that the Mexican and Turkish companies were, indeed, subsidized unfairly or "dumped" in most cases.As a result of the preliminary affirmative determinations in these investigations, Commerce will instruct US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to require cash deposits based on the preliminary rate of dumping for each company in the investigation.The petitioner for these investigations is the Rebar Trade Action Coalition and its individual members: Nucor Corporation, Gerdau Ameristeel U.S. Inc., Commercial Metals Company, Cascade Steel Rolling Mills, Inc., and Byer Steel Group, Inc. (OH). These are only preliminary determinations and the Commerce Dept. is scheduled to announce its final determinations on or about July 3, 2014. This deadline may be extended.
