Copper Down; CRU Says Too Much Surplus AvailableThe copper market's surplus this year will be almost four times bigger than previously estimated as demand slows in leading consumer China, metals researcher CRU told Bloomberg News last week. Production will outpace demand by 140,000 metric tons, Vanessa Davidson, copper group manager at CRU, said in an interview in London. That compares with 36,000 tons projected as of January. The researcher cut its estimate for this year's global usage by 45,000 tons, citing weaker demand in China.
