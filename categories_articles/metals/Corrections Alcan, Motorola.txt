Corrections Alcan, MotorolaAlcan is a Canadian company, not an American one, as we claimed in our article on the aluminium industry published on March 5th. In our survey of Taiwan published on January 15th, we stated incorrectly that Motorola had nearly half of Taiwan's mobile-phone market. The correct figure is about a fifth. Apologies.
