Demand for HRC, Steel Plate Down; Japan’s JFE Raises PricesJapanese steelmaker JFE announced it is raising prices for its flat steel products including hot rolled coil, cold rolled coil, and coated steel products by JPY 3,000 per ton. The move to raise prices comes after India's Essar and JSW cut prices to their primary steel products last week. The steel market is in a lull with lots of regional variation for construction demand.
