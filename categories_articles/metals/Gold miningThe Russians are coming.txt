Gold miningThe Russians are comingVLADIMIR POTANIN and Mikhail Prokhorov, joint bosses of Russia's Norilsk Nickel, want to be global gold tycoons as well. In 2002 Norilsk bought Polyus, Russia's largest gold producer; in 2003 two smaller gold miners there; and last April 20% of Gold Fields of South Africa, one of the global giants. This week Norilsk, whose shares are quoted in Moscow and on NASDAQ, announced plans to hive off all its gold interests into a separate company, also quoted at home and abroad.And next? Last October, Norilsk pledged its support to a takeover bid for Gold Fields launched by a smaller South African rival, Harmony. But money-losing Harmony could offer only paper, not cash, and its shares soon slumped (by this week to 46% below their pre-bid price). The bid won little other support. It is still limping through regulatory hurdles, but shows few signs of life, and fewer still of success. Norilsk began wavering long ago.Gold Fields this week was saying it would love to work with Norilsk as a "partner" and, by implication, in Russia. Norilsk may well have grander ideas. Its gold output, around 1m ounces a year, is only one-quarter of Gold Fields's; and the Gold Fields share price this week, after the Norilsk news, offered no hint of any future merger scheme, let alone bid, from Russia. But rule nothing out: Mr Potanin, a dollar billionaire, and Mr Prokhorov, Norilsk's chief executive, are not short of ambition.
