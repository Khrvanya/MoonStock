Gold productionThe output of the world's gold mines fell by 4% last year, according to estimates in a new report from the GFMS, a consultancy. More than half the 88-tonne fall in production was accounted for by a slump in gold mining in Indonesia. Supply from South Africa, once the world's largest producer, fell by 14%--the biggest drop since the Boer War. Last year's fall was partly owing to new safety procedures, which helped reduce the industry's fatality rate. Skills shortages and power cuts also affected operations. Australia's output fell by 14%, too, amid reports that some fledgling mining firms faced closure because of scarce credit. Of the world's six big producers, China, Russia and Peru all increased output last year.
