The field may hold as much as 50 billion barrels of oil -- almost as big as all of the reserves held in the U.S. (around 61 billion barrels).If and when oil from Iran's new field ever reaches world markets, however, is another matter.Looking for metal price forecasting and data analysis in one easy-to-use platform?
