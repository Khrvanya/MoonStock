Greenland’s electionsBelow the iceSHE grew up in a remote fishing village. Her father fell through the ice and died when she was seven. She was supposed to marry a hunter, but refused. Now Aleqa Hammond, who is 47 years old, looks set to become Greenland's first female prime minister. At elections on March 12th her social democratic Siumut party won 42.8% of the vote, beating the prime minister, Kuupik Kleist, and his socialist Inuit Ataqatigiit party, which came in at 34%.Mr Kleist lost over the issue of mining. Greenland's mineral wealth--which includes rare earths, essential to making many electronic devices--is becoming accessible as the country's ice cap melts. But many Greenlanders fear the impact of a mining boom. Complicating things, rare earths are often intermingled with uranium; its extraction is banned in Denmark, which still has a say in many of the affairs of its former colony.Both Inuit Ataqatigiit and Siumut are broadly pro-mining, but in different ways. Mr Kleist's government passed a law that allows mining firms to hire cheap foreign workers, but he is hesitant about lifting the ban on uranium extraction. Ms Hammond has said she would try to do just that, but wants mining firms to pay royalties. In the end Mr Kleist was seen as too pro-investor. He also seemed out of touch with ordinary people, whereas Ms Hammond is charismatic.She will now have to cobble together a coalition: the vote left her two seats short of a majority in Greenland's 31-seat parliament. It will be hard for her to ignore Partii Inuit, a protest party, which scored 6.4%. Its leader, Nikku Olsen, campaigned on limiting the influence of foreigners--including Danes.Ms Hammond's decision could be felt around the world: depending on what happens in Greenland, China may no longer be able to dominate the market for rare earths. A lot rests on a country that is four times the size of France but has a population of only 57,000.
