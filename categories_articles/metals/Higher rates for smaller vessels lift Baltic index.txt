Higher rates for smaller vessels lift Baltic indexFeb 24 (Reuters) - The Baltic Exchange's main sea freight index edged higher on Monday as gains in the panamax and supramax vessel segments offset lower capesize rates. * The Baltic index, which tracks rates for capesize, panamax and supramax vessels that ferry dry bulk commodities, rose 9 points to 506 points. * The panamax index climbed 24 points, or 3%, to 811 points, its highest since Jan. 21. * The index registered its 13th straight session of gains. * Average daily earnings for panamaxes, which usually carry coal or grain cargoes of about 60,000 tonnes to 70,000 tonnes, increased $215 to $7,302. * The supramax index rose 19 points to 543. * Meanwhile, the capesize index fell 13 points to -239 points. * Average daily earnings for capesizes, which typically transport 170,000 to 180,000 tonne cargoes including iron ore and coal, declined by $94 to $2,693. * The coronavirus outbreak has led to a reduction in shipping demand from China as the epidemic has forced authorities to shut factories and mills. * Stockpiles at China's ports fell further to 128.6 million tonnes as of Feb. 21, from 130.65 million tonnes a week earlier, data compiled by SteelHome consultancy showed.
