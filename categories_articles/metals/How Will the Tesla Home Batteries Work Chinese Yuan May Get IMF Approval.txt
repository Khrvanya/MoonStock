How Will the Tesla Home Batteries Work Chinese Yuan May Get IMF ApprovalNew metal technologies play a key role in all we do here at MetalCrawler and none could be more promising than Tesla Motors' line of batteries for the home. The Chinese yuan may also be on the cusp of being declared not manipulated by the International Monetary Fund.The idea is that homes and businesses powered by solar panels could harvest and store energy during the day that could be used to run homes at night, or be used as a backup during a power outage.Why Manufacturers Need to Ditch Purchase Price VarianceAlthough the exact technology involved in the battery, called Powerwall, is a closely guarded Tesla secret, it probably isn't based on revolutionary concepts, Jordi Cabana, a chemistry professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago told Live Science. Cabana studies new battery materials and said the batteries look as if they are based on the same lithium-ion batteries in Tesla's cars."Just looking at the specs that they publicize, it doesn't look very different -- in terms of the cost -- to what they're putting in their cars," Cabana said.The company is also planning to unveil a business-based battery-storage system, called the Powerpack, though the price for that system has not been released yet. Tesla is already taking orders for its residential system, but the products won't ship until late summer, company representatives said at the news conference.In what would be a blow to US manufacturers, particularly steelmakers, the International Monetary Fund is close to declaring China's yuan fairly valued for the first time in more than a decade, according to the Wall Street Journal, a milestone in the country's efforts to open its economy that would blunt US criticism of Beijing's currency policy.The fund's reassessment of the yuan--set to be made official in IMF reports on China's economy due out in the coming months--follows years of IMF censure of Beijing's management of the currency.Your email address will not be published.
