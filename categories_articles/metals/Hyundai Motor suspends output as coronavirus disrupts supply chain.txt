Hyundai Motor suspends output as coronavirus disrupts supply chainSEOUL, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor plans to gradually suspend its South Korean factories starting on Tuesday, as a virus outbreak in China has disrupted supplies of a vehicle component, Yonhap News Agency said. Hyundai's South Korean factories will be fully idled from Feb. 7 to Feb. 10 or Feb. 11, Yonhap added. A Hyundai Motor union official confirmed the factory suspension, but did not give further details. (Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin and Joyce Lee; Editing by Christian Schmollinger)
