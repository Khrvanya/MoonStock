Impeachment of Trump sets 'toxic' precedent, U.S. Senate leader saysWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House of Representatives' impeachment of President Donald Trump over his handling of Ukraine sets a "toxic" precedent for future U.S. presidents, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday.  "This particular House of Representatives has let its partisan rage at this particular president create a toxic new precedent that will echo well into the future," McConnell said, adding that House Democrats who control the chamber have failed to do their duty.
