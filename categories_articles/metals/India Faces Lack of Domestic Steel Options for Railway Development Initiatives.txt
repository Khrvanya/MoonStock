India Faces Lack of Domestic Steel Options for Railway Development InitiativesThe railways sector is one of the high-growth areas in India, so far as infrastructure is concerned.Need buying strategies for steel?

The government wants more of the IR projects given to domestic steelmakers, pointing to some other nations where steel for such projects are procured from the local market.The Railways, on the other hand, says there are only two, of which one, the Steel Authority of India (SAIL) has been persistently falling short of manufacturing targets. The other is private company Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL).Until July 2018, when JSPL got its first rail supply project, SAIL was the only supplier of rails in India. The former was asked to supply 100,000 tons of rail track, and later in the year bagged an additional order for supply of 30,000 tons.A couple of years ago, the IR was granted an exemption from the mandatory local sourcing clause for procuring steel rails. However, that was given when SAIL had expressed its inability to meet the entire requirement of the IR.Now, once again, JSPL has emerged as the lowest bidder for a 450,000-ton railway order, beating none other than ArcelorMittal, the New Indian Express reports.In fact, at a recent meeting of the Railway Board, concerns were raised over SAIL's supply crunch. In short, supply are wheels and axles, which SAIL said was due to production glitches.Want to see an Aluminum Price forecast?
