This is aimed at helping local steelmakers benefit when there is a surge in imports, the government said.A statement by the government said Chinese imports "were distorting the domestic market, which was under huge stress and led to financial stress in the industry."In the past, too, India has imposed a slew of anti-dumping duties on imports of steel and stainless steel products from China, Japan and South Korea.According to a Reuters report, the U.S. Department of Commerce also said it would be looking into possible dumping and subsidization of stainless steel flanges from China and India.Steel producers in India have welcomed the move.According to Jindal Stainless Vice-Chairman Abhyuday Jindal, the decision will encourage production of the metal within the country and will provide some relief to the domestic industry.India's apex stainless steel industry body, the Indian Stainless Steel Development Association (ISSDA), has also welcomed the imposition of countervailing duty, President KK Pahuja said.Due to the subsidized imports from China, the domestic players were facing huge losses. Industry experts have claimed several MSME segment businesses were forced to shut down due to subsidized imports from China. The imposition of a countervailing duty would help revive the industry, regain lost ground and create jobs, the Pahuja added.Free Sample Report: Our Annual Metal Buying OutlookThe CVD investigation was initiated on April 12, 2016, by the Directorate General of Anti-Dumping and Allied Duties (DGAD) in response to a surge in subsidized imports of stainless steel flat products from China.Your email address will not be published.
