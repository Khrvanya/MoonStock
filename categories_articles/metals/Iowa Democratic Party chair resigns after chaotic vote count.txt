Iowa Democratic Party chair resigns after chaotic vote count(Reuters) - Iowa Democratic Party chair Troy Price resigned on Wednesday after the failure of a vote-counting app and a backup phone system caused several days of delay in determining the results of the state's influential presidential nominating caucuses. "Democrats deserved better than what happened on caucus night," Price said in a statement distributed by the party. Reporting by Sharon Bernstein in Sacramento; Editing by Scott Malone and Chris Reese
