Iron and Steel Institute Applauds Infrastructure Bill Committee PassageThe American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) hailed the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's unanimous passage yesterday of the Surface Transportation Reauthorization and Reform Act (STRRA) of 2015. The legislation provides limited authorizations for infrastructure projects for the next 6 years.Free Sample Report: Our Annual Metal Buying OutlookIt comes at a cost of $325 billion, only the first 3 years of which are yet accounted for in current spending. Many House members have already said they will only support the bill if lawmakers come up with a way to fund the last 3 years of the proposal.Thomas J. Gibson, AISI president and CEO, said, "The House Transportation committee, led by Chairman Bill Shuster (R-PA), made good  progress toward fixing our crumbling infrastructure by passing this long-awaited multi-year authorization bill, and we commend their dedication and commitment to bipartisanship. This bill benefits the steel industry by creating an environment for the quick delivery of projects and by providing the certainty needed for long-term, steel-intensive highway and bridge projects to break ground.Free Download: The October MMI ReportGibson also said AISI is urging support for an amendment by Congressman Reid Ribble (R-Wis.), which was not voted on in committee but will be considered during floor debate on the bill, calling for state-optional reforms in federal truck weight limits to allow 6-axle trucks to carry up to 91,000 pounds of cargo. AISI has long-supported this policy to improve efficiency and safety, and lower logistical costs for steel manufacturers, fabricators and shippers.Please follow Jeff Yoders on Twitter @jyoders19Your email address will not be published.
