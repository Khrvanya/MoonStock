Is that a rebel rock on your fingerTHE United Nations, for a second time, is trying to end an African civil war by restricting the rebels' source of revenue. In 1998 the Security Council imposed a ban on trade with UNITA, the rebel movement in Angola. This week, on July 5th, it passed a resolution banning diamond exports from Sierra Leone, at least until the country's government gains control of its diamond mines, and can establish a certification system for legally mined stones. At present, most of Sierra Leone's diamonds are mined by the rebels, who sell them to buy weapons. No one believes that a ban on something as tiny and valuable as diamonds can be completely effective; someone will always buy them. A recent UN report found that the sanctions on trade with the Angolan rebels, which is also largely in diamonds, were ineffective, partly because several African heads of state ignored them. Sierra Leone's diamond trade tends to make its way through Liberia. That country's president, Charles Taylor, backs Sierra Leone's rebels and is suspected of acting as their middle-man. West African governments, supported by the United States, opposed a British attempt to extend the ban to Liberia. But at least the UN ban will drive down the price of diamonds from Sierra Leone. Already De Beers, which handles about 70% of gemstone production, has said it will not buy diamonds from any conflict zone. Other leading traders have said the same, as have the governments of countries--Belgium, Israel and India--which import rough diamonds for cutting and polishing. This means that diamond smugglers will get less money from dealers prepared to break the ban. But how much less? Nobody knows: estimates range from a 2% to a 50% cut in prices.
