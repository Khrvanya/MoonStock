Jingye moves ahead with British Steel takeover, saving 3,200 jobsMarch 3 (Reuters) - Chinese steelmaker Jingye Group said on Tuesday it has agreed to proceed towards the completion of its buyout of British Steel, saving 3,200 jobs and unlocking 1.2 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) in investment. Jingye said in a statement it will acquire British Steel's main plant, in the northern English town of Scunthorpe, despite not having a reply from the French government about its French unit, which had been seen as a potential stumbling block to the deal.
