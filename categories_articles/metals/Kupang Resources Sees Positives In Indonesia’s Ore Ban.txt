Kupang Resources Sees Positives In Indonesia’s Ore BanNot such a bad thing after all? "Australia's Kupang Resources finds itself in a sweet spot after Indonesia passed a mining law banning raw mineral ore exports," reports Reuters."Even before Indonesia made exporting certain ores illegal on Jan. 12 in the hope it will lead to development of a homegrown smelting and refining industry, Kupang was in the final stages of constructing a factory to process manganese ore into a semi-manufactured form in West Timor in Nusa Tenggara province.""Kupang's manager of operations, Simon Youds, said locals have long mined the rich endowments of manganese ore found in West Timor and shipped it to places like China where it is refined and sold onwards for greater profit.
