LME Begins Consultation on Opening LMESelect to Non-Clearing MembersThe London Metal Exchange (LME) yesterday launched a month-long consultation on proposals designed to broaden access to its electronic trading platform, LMEselect. The changes put forward include opening up LMEselect access to category 3 and category 4 (non-clearing) members of the exchange as well as adding flexibility to the criteria required to apply for LME membership.Why Manufacturers Need to Ditch Purchase Price Variance"Today's proposals are crucial to our overarching aim to maximize liquidity and participation on the LME," said Garry Jones, LME CEO. "Opening up access to trading on LMEselect is beneficial to everyone trading on any one of our venues as it will bring more liquidity and price transparency to all."Adding flexibility to the application criteria for LME membership means that prospective members may, in some cases, benefit from exemptions from the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) authorization requirements, which represents a significant step in the LME's Liquidity Roadmap. The changes would make the LME electronic market more attractive to non-UK based traders who want to take advantage of the Exchange's enhanced liquidity initiatives but who are currently not eligible or are discouraged from applying by electronic access restrictions.If the LME decides to proceed with the proposed changes after the consultation period ends, then full details of the category 4 membership requirements including fees and B share requirements will be published.Your email address will not be published.
