Lonmin had anticipated a mass return of its employees to work last week, but striking members of the main Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) prevented many other workers from going back to the mines.The strike has also hit the South African operations of Anglo American Platinum and Impala Platinum, taking out 40 percent of global production of the precious metal used for emissions-capping catalytic converters in automobiles. Still, platinum price has been largely unaffected as buyers amassed large stockpiles of the precious metal during the months prior to the strike.With a 1.6 percent increase on Wednesday, May 21, Chinese palladium bar was the biggest mover on the Global Precious Metals MMI(r).
