Lynas Corp Gets Green Light, But Rare Earths Price Index Still At Dismal All-Time LowWell, looks like Lynas Corp. has been granted a full license for its Lynas Advanced Material Plant (LAMP) operating in Kuantan, Malaysia, amidst much civilian protest - but that actually seems moot in light of recent news.MetalMiner's monthly Rare Earths MMI(r) registered a value of 27 in September, the second straight month of the lowest-ever reading for this index. Which means mainly one thing - that there must still be a load of over-supplied material out there, especially cerium and lanthanum, and buyers know it. (It's no surprise that this month, cerium oxide and lanthanum oxide were the two Biggest Losers within the MMI - see below.) Not only that, but substitutes for REEs have penetrated the markets in the wake of the 2010 price bubble, which won't really help support RE prices.Compare with last month's trends - here's our free August MMI(r) Report.Interestingly, we found an infographic via The Visual Capitalist that partially explains why, from a fundamental supply/demand perspective, rare earth prices could actually remain depressed for, um, the rest of time as we know it.More on that, and complete monthly price changes for the rare earth metals and oxides tracked by the MetalMiner IndX, in the full article!
