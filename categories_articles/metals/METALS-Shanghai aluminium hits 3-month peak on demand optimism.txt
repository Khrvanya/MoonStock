METALS-Shanghai aluminium hits 3-month peak on demand optimismSINGAPORE, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Shanghai aluminium scaled a three-month high on Wednesday, as the expected finalization of an initial U.S.-China trade deal fuelled optimism about demand for the metal used in transportation, construction and packaging. Aluminium demand has turned "extremely good" in China, said a source with a major smelter. "Real estate is quite good and expectations are not bad either" "Everyone has become optimistic," after news about the interim U.S.-China trade deal, the source added. Global investor confidence has improved since the United States and China last week said they reached a "phase one" trade pact to cool their 17-month-long trade war that has hurt global economic growth and the demand for most base metals, including aluminium. The most traded aluminium contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) climbed as much as 1% to 14,115 yuan ($2,005.28) a tonne, a level not seen since Sept. 18. Benchmark three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was 0.4% higher at $1,771 a tonne by 0315 GMT. * ALUMINA: China's average price of alumina SMM-ALM-AVEG, the substance used to make aluminium, fell to 2,429 yuan a tonne, its lowest since May 2017, lowering production costs for aluminium smelters. * LEAD: China's lead production hit a record high of 572,000 tonnes in November, up 15.1% year-on-year, sparking oversupply concern and pushing ShFE lead to 14,740 yuan a tonne, its lowest since April 2018. * BALANCE: But the global lead market recorded a deficit of 81,000 tonnes in the first 10 months of this year, compared with a shortage of 53,000 tonnes in the same period of 2018, the International Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG) said. * ZINC: The global zinc market moved to a surplus of 7,300 tonnes in October from a deficit of 21,100 tonnes in September.
