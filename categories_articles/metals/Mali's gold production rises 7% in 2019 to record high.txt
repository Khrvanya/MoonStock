Mali's gold production rises 7% in 2019 to record highBAMAKO, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Mali's industrial gold production rose 7% in 2019 to a record 65.1 tonnes, mines ministry statistics showed on Wednesday. The increase was partly due to the launch of production at a mine owned by Australia's Resolute Mining, ministry official Mamadou Sidibe said. The West African country's total gold output last year was probably around 71.1 tonnes due to the additional 6 tonnes of gold that artisanal miners are estimated to produce each year, Sidibe said. Industrial production is expected to increase further in 2020, he said, without giving further details. Reporting by Tiemoko Diallo
