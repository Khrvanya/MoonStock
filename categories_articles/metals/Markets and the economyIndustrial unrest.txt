Markets and the economyIndustrial unrestTHE third quarter results season started gloomily with Alcoa downgrading its forecast for global aluminium demand, thanks to a slowing Chinese economy. Industrial stocks, those most exposed to the economic cycle, have been disappointing investors for some time. Andrew Lapthorne of Societe Generale reports that the industrial sector, along with the also-cyclical basic materials group, has seen the worst balance between earnings upgrades and downgrades over the last month. The bad news is pretty evenly spread across the globe although Japan is the worst performer; presumably because of the political dispute with China which has disrupted production.As the graph shows, industrial stocks have been on a steady, although not precipitate, downtrend relative to the world market for the last 8 months. It is yet another sign that the global economy is slowing (see the recent post on corporate bond spreads for another indicator). Andrew Parry and James Rutherford, fund managers at Hermes SourceCap, say European companies are, like Alcoa, finding China a particular disappointment. And there is still scope for further downgrades; SG says the consensus forecast is for a 14% rise in global industrial earnings next year.
