You can register for this FREE event, here.We've covered the so-called "Car Wars" extensively on the site in recent years with Lisa herself authoring a 5-part series comparing the automotive industry (and lightweighting, specifically, within it) to the main storyline running through the sprawling space drama concocted by George Lucas himself. A unique comparison, no doubt, but an apt one at that. You can find Episode One, here.
