MiningDemanding supplyHEAVY global demand, particularly from China, has sent metals prices surging in recent years. For mining companies it is a time of plenty. Some of their bumper profits have encouraged a wave of mergers. Miners are also doing what they can to find fresh reserves and boost output. But underinvestment in the 1990s means that mining firms lack not only trained geologists and engineers but also the heavy machinery vital for increased production. Delivery times for the priciest sorts of mining equipment can be quadruple what they were before the metals-price boom.AFP
