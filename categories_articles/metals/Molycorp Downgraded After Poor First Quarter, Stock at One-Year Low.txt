Molycorp closed at $3.05, recording an intra-day loss of 17.8% during the day. Earlier last week, the company reported higher losses and lower revenues on a yearly basis for its first quarter of fiscal year 2014 due to lower pricing of rare earths and magnetic powders. Molycorp's travails are indicative of the problems faced by the entire rare earths mining industry as declines were seen on the weekly MMI for most of the computing and industrial metals.
