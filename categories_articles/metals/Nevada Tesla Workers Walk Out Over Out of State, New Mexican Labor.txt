Nevada Tesla Workers Walk Out Over Out of State, New Mexican LaborOn Monday, hundreds of Nevada Tesla Motors workers walked off their jobs at the giant battery factory that the company is building in the desert outside Reno, Nev. It wasn't your typical picket: They weren't protesting bad working conditions, or making a show of force around contract negotiations.
