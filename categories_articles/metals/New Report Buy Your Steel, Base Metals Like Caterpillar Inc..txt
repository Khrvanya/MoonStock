New Report Buy Your Steel, Base Metals Like Caterpillar Inc.With our Monthly MMI(r) report, your company can get one step closer to developing the strategies needed to buy your metals like the big boys.Just as we at MetalMiner are generally in a wait-and-see approach as far as springtime's arrival here in the US Midwest, the same can be said for our approach with most of the metals sectors that we track in the Monthly MMI(r). (More details on the report's methodology here.)As MetalMiner Executive Editor Lisa Reisman puts it, "March definitely went out like a lamb from a metals markets perspective."Most of the 10 metals sub-indexes that we track dribbled downward, with a few holding steady and only one - the Stainless MMI(r) - rising on the month (which is surprising, as nickel prices have been the primary drag on the stainless index for several months).Within this report, you'll get a better sense of what your company should do in the near, medium and longer term regarding the metals you buy - should you buy forward now, or wait? Should you hedge up? Should you hold pat? What are the top indicators to watch for outside of price movements? It's all in there.Fill out the form below to download the free report (*Members, just log in to grab the PDF!):
