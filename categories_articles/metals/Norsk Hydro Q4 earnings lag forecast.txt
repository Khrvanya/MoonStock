Norsk Hydro Q4 earnings lag forecastOSLO, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Aluminium producer Norsk Hydro reported a much smaller than expected rise in fourth-quarter earnings on Friday and said its results were weighed down by low metals prices. Underlying October-December earnings before interest and tax rose to 560 million Norwegian crowns ($60.69 million) from 534 million crowns a year earlier, lagging the average estimate of 1.02 billion crowns in a poll supplied by Hydro. It maintained an annual dividend of 1.25 crowns per share, while analysts on average had expected a decline to 1.20 crowns.
