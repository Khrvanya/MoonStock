Outokumpu to Keep ThyssenKrupp’s German Stainless Plant Open in 2015Stainless steelmaker Outokumpu agreed last week to push back the planned closure of its plant in Bochum, Germany until at least August 2015 and offer its workers compensation as well as jobs elsewhere. Outokumpu said in February it had scrapped plans to shut the plant, which it bought as part of its acquisition of German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp's stainless steel business last year.
