POSCO's Indian steel projectGreens v jobsINDIA needs steel, ports and investment. POSCO, a South Korean steel giant, wants to invest 545 billion rupees ($12 billion) to build a steel plant with a port in Orissa, a poorish state with lots of iron ore. It would be the single biggest foreign investment in India ever, and yield 12m tonnes of steel a year. Yet for five years the plan got nowhere. Farmers, fishermen, poor tribespeople and forest activists are fiercely opposed. They argue that the likely benefits, such as 17,000 jobs, would be outweighed by ecological damage and disruption to local lives. On January 3rd an environmental panel set up by the government approved an initial stage of the project, to produce 4m tonnes a year on a 4,000-acre (1,600-hectare) site. Yet POSCO's people are not cheering. They are waiting for India's environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, to give a final ruling. Last month Mr Ramesh said he remained "uncertain". He seems unswayed by the steel minister, Virbhadra Singh, who grumbles that if India approved investments faster it would produce an extra 36m tonnes of steel a year. Last year Mr Ramesh blocked another big venture, by Vedanta, a British firm, which had sought for five years to mine bauxite in the forested hills of Orissa. Vedanta, he ruled, had flouted environmental laws. But the POSCO project is different. It would be built mostly on coastal scrubland, not forest. And it would fit comfortably with India's wish for closer economic ties with its East Asian allies, South Korea and Japan.
