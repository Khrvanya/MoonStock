Palladium Price Weakness Drags Down Precious Metals WorldwideWithout major central bank actions, precious metals will continue to fall in Q2 and possibly longer.Free Download: Cost Certainty for Overseas Precious Metal PurchasesThe decline that began in February has taken hold and looks to be a long-term trend that won't end, based on market forces alone, for some time.The monthly Global Precious Metals MMI(r) registered a value of 83 in April, a decrease of 3.5% from 86 in March.With most of our metals still in bearish territory, even if they're posting small gains on the monthly MMI, global precious was a bright spot through January, when it was still being bolstered by strong industrial and investor demand for palladium. That demand began dropping last month and, without palladium to prop it up, our index fell even further this month without much hope for recovery.* Get the complete prices every day on the MetalMiner IndX(sm) As my colleague Raul de Frutos pointed out recently, palladium has broken a key support level and this indicates that selling pressure is increasing as the metal declines. It's now recording lower high points on the CME's spot index and that's a clear sign that there is diminishing buying pressure during upward bounces.Palladium-backed exchange-traded funds also saw their biggest weekly outflows (more than 50,000 ounces) since August last week. A  strong dollar and low oil prices look like barriers that automotive demand, alone, can't overcome for palladium. The mining cost of platinum and palladium has gone down with the ruble in top producer Russia and supply should be abundant enough to meet demand as production is being buttressed by the favorable exchange rate there and in number two producer South Africa.Gold is still falling in most of the world in the face of that strong dollar, as well. While many long-term forecasts predict that Chinese and Indian demand will eventually propel the world's favorite investment metal upward, the continuing strength of the dollar as a reserve currency is hurting it even more than base metals with more industrial uses.The Federal Reserve remains conservative when it comes to when it will raise interest rates for and it's not likely that other central banks will make a major move to rein in the strength of their currencies before the Fed. Chairwoman Janet Yellen also warned of continuing slow growth domestically and internationally this month, an argument that would seem to support keeping the rates low for the foreseeable future.My colleague, Stuart Burns, wrote this month that other strong economies such as the UK are not likely to join in raising central bank rates for at least a further 12 months even if the Fed raises its rates tomorrow. That will exacerbate the dollar's strength, particularly against economic regions such as the European Union, which is still dependent on a quantitative easing program.Our Free MetalMiner Newsletter(c)2020 MetalMiner  All rights reserved. | Media Kit | Cookie Consent Settings | privacy policy | terms of service
