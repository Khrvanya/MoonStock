Peru's Central Bank gloomier on 2019 growth projectionsSANTIAGO, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Peru's Central Bank on Friday said it had reduced its economic growth projection for 2019 to 2.3% from 2.7% previously amid a slowdown in the global economy and lower public investment in the Andean nation. The bank maintained its estimate for 3.8% GDP growth by 2020 in its latest macroeconomic projections report. It saw a lower fiscal deficit for 2019 of 1.7% of GDP compared to a previous 2.0% projection, and 1.6% by 2020. It projected inflation at 1.9% for 2019, down from 2.0% previously predicted, and maintained its projection of 2.0% inflation for 2020.
