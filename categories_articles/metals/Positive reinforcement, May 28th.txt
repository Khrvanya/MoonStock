Positive reinforcement, May 28thSIR --You list the plans to produce aluminium in Greenland as a case of 'Positive reinforcement'. I believe the opposite is true. If Greenland's glaciers melt and their power is not harnessed with dams it will simply go to waste. Greenland cannot be easily connected to other grids so turning this clean power into aluminium is the most practical way to export it. Cheap aluminium from Greenland may displace aluminium production in other parts of the world, where it competes for electricity with other users and some of the power is generated from gas or coal. Aluminium is replacing heavier steel in cars. Lighter cars have better fuel efficiency and generate less emissionsover the vehicle's lifetime. Iron for steel is reduced from its oxide ore with coal, emitting large amounts of CO2 compared to the electrical process for producing aluminium.If Greenland's glaciers are victims of global warming then let us at least use them to give Antarctica's a fighting chance.Oren TiroshTel Aviv
