Prices of Aluminum, Copper, HRC Steel in 2016You read right, dear readers - MetalMiner unveiled its forecast of average 2016 prices for aluminum, copper, nickel, lead, zinc, tin and hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel yesterday, and you may be surprised that we're more bearish than the big banks (the Standards, Macquaries, Goldman Sachses and the like) and their 2016 average price forecasts.And all of these average price forecasts can be yours...as soon as our Annual Metal Buying Outlook is published and ready for download. (Hint: it could drop as early as the end of this week. We'll update this post with the link to the report, so bookmark us!)As far as MetalMiner's departure from the banks' forecasts, co-founder and editor-at-large Stuart Burns had this to say recently: "It's definitely a bullish tone that bank and senior research analysts have taken...in our view, there's still plenty of excess capacity out there, demand is weak, and the dollar is strengthening," and those factors, ultimately, may make many of the banks' forecasts turn from bullish to bearish sooner rather than later.We're not the only ones on the block with a bearish outlook - just yesterday, the WTO released updates on its 2015 and 2016 global trade outlook. According to their full release, WTO economists have lowered their forecast for world trade growth in 2015 to 2.8%, from the 3.3% forecast made in April, and reduced their estimate for 2016 to 3.9% from 4.0%.Some main takeaways:For more on what US and global construction sector indicators can tell us, make sure you check out my colleague Jeff's rundown today.Don't forget, come back for our annual 2016 outlook!Your email address will not be published.
