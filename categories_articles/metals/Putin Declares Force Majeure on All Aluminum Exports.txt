Putin Declares Force Majeure on All Aluminum ExportsRussian President Vladimir Putin declared force majeure on all Russian aluminum exports to the US and Europe following the recent ruling in favor of primary producer UC Rusal against the London Metal Exchange (LME) for new rules designed to cut long aluminum load-out rates.Despite Rusal's win in the high court, the Russian president appeared defiant against Western demands for diplomacy with the situation in Ukraine. "I am sick and tired of hearing about these threats of sanctions from the West against us...therefore I have preemptively declared force majeure on all aluminum exports effective immediately," the angry president told Interfax, a news agency, early on Tuesday."Now the West can have a taste of their own medicine," he said.With an estimated 9 percent of total world production of primary aluminum ingot, Putin's declaration will likely cause dramatic price spikes for aluminum. In fact, MetalMiner predicts LME prices will steadily increase while Midwest premiums may skyrocket.
