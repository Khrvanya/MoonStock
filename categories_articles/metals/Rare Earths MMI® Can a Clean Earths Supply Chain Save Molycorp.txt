Rare Earths MMI® Can a Clean Earths Supply Chain Save MolycorpRare earth prices are falling because the metals used in magnets, batteries and electronics are not so, well, rare, these days. That availability has come with a major environmental price.Free Webinar: What The EPA Clean Power Plan Could Cost Your BusinessChina has lost control of its smaller, unauthorized rare-earth producers and, without export quotas, those metals are finding their way to foreign markets.In addition to upsetting markets, most of unauthorized producers also have minimal environmental controls and even government-approved factories dump acid-rich, radioactive waste water into giant, leaky, unlined ponds which are threatening to pollute the Yellow River, a source of water for 150 million people.Molycorp, by contrast, has cleaned up its act and spent billions restoring its Mountain Pass, Calif., project, replacing its extraction systems and securing its mines.Molycorp told Fortune it is building a rare earth supply chain that does not produce the kind of horrifying environmental damage other mines do. That means everything from using a process called chloralkali to use recycled water to separate the ore-less bad than chemicals, apparently-to generating power on-site.The company is also using a new process to seal and bury its toxic tailings. Before reopening Mountain Pass, Molycorp used to dump its tailings in a slurry behind a dam. Now it uses a high-pressure system to squeeze out most of the water, leaving behind a "paste" that will be reburied in what's essentially a 90-acre landfill just west of the pit mine.Molycorp was recently selected as a 10-year provider of rare earths to Siemens AG for its wind turbine business and both companies touted its clean supply chain as a reason behind the move. If Molycorp, and other US-based rare earths miners, want to compete with the glut of Chinese products the way they will have to distinguish themselves is through supply chain accountability.Our Free MetalMiner Newsletter(c)2020 MetalMiner  All rights reserved. | Media Kit | Cookie Consent Settings | privacy policy | terms of service
