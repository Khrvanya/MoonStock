Raw Steels MMI® Holds Steady in its Low Trough With No SupportSteel prices remain at their lowest levels. Almost every industrial metal price rose in April as a weaker dollar gave a boost to commodity markets. However, steel prices remained quiet, hanging at record lows.The monthly raw steels MMI(r) registered a value of 60 in May, on par with April's value.Scrap prices are at their lowest levels and we don't really see anything that could give prices significant momentum on the upside, at least until a bigger supply response is seen.Why Manufacturers Need to Ditch Purchase Price VarianceUnless we start seeing the dollar depreciate against other currencies, European scrap exports will keep gaining market share, leaving a supply excess for US steelmakers.Moreover, although prices seem low, it's still cheaper to make steel still using iron ore than scrap. Pig iron or billet could substitute some scrap as primary raw material in which case, US exporters would sell more in the domestic market, causing US scrap prices to keep falling lower.Meanwhile, steel imports keep arriving. Since US prices are no longer inflated compared to the rest of the world ,we would imagine steel imports to start slowing down through the remainder of the year. However, Chinese exports could actually increase due to the recent removal of export tariffs.Either way, steel demand remains weak, particularly in oil and gas tubular markets while the market remains oversupplied. It doesn't seem likely that steel prices will rise significantly higher this year.Our Free MetalMiner Newsletter(c)2020 MetalMiner  All rights reserved. | Media Kit | Cookie Consent Settings | privacy policy | terms of service
