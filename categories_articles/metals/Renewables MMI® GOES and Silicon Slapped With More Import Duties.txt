Renewables MMI® GOES and Silicon Slapped With More Import DutiesLast week the Department of Commerce doubled down and announced more import duties on silicon photovoltaic products- including cells, modules, laminates and/or panels - that might be used in production of solar power from China and Taiwan. The new duties will make it difficult for Chinese solar panel manufacturers to import any version of silicon that can later be used in solar panels without paying import duties ranging from 26 to 44% of their total value.
