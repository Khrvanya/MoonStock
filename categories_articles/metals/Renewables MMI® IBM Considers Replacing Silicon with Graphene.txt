Renewables MMI® IBM Considers Replacing Silicon with GrapheneCarbon Sciences Inc., the developer of a breakthrough technology to mass-produce graphene, commented today on IBM's recent announcement that it is considering replacing silicon with graphene for its LED and possibly solar panel applications. Graphene is a refined metal made from 99.9% pure graphite. It is a better conductor of heat and energy than copper and stronger than most thin-film applications for silicon.FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering the Renewable Energy metals market.IBM has developed a new method to use graphene as a substrate for single-crystalline semiconductor film growth such as the films used in LED lighting. Graphene will be less expensive than current single-crystalline wafers used in such production methods, as it can be reused indefinitely.
