Silver Drops 5% as Federal Reserve Statements Stunt Precious MetalsSilver fell again on Monday. Some of Silver's recent weakness is being blamed on the Federal Reserve, since new chair Janet Yellen suggested interest rates could be hiked sooner than expected as the firmer US dollar could take away the investments some would make in precious metals. Consumer confidence data came in its highest since 2008 as well.  The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes rose to 82.3, the highest since January 2008, from an upwardly revised 78.3 in February and against an expected reading of 78.6.
