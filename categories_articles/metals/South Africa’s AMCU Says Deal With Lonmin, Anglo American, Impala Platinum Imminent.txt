South Africa’s AMCU Says Deal With Lonmin, Anglo American, Impala Platinum ImminentThe leader of South Africa's largest miners' union said on Friday a wage deal with the top three platinum producers was imminent, signalling a possible end to a crippling five-month strike that has disrupted global output of the metal.FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering the Precious markets.Workers from the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) begged leader Joseph Mathunjwa on Thursday to end the country's longest mining strike and sign the latest offer - an increase of about 20 percent, or 1,000 rand (54.7 pounds) a month, Reuters reported.Mathunjwa told Johannesburg radio he would take the offer to more AMCU members at mines on Friday, before meeting with management at Lonmin, Anglo American Platinum and Impala Platinum later or over the weekend to relay the response of his miners to their offer.Markets reacted as prices for platinum and its precious metals cousin, palladium, declined. Stockpiles by industrial users largely muted any impact the strike had on global platinum and palladium prices, anyway.
