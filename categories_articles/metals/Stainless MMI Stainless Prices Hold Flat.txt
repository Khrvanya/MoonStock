The March PMI surpassed expectations and was up from 49.9 the previous month. The increase seems to come from Chinese state stimulus measures now impacting the economy, according to press reports. Additionally, other sources cite recovered export demand as the impetus behind the upbeat PMI reading.The availability of cheaper pig nickel iron -- an innovation created in China, which uses laterite nickel ores instead of pure nickel -- helps mitigate nickel price increases by serving as an alternative to standard nickel as an input in stainless steel production.In order to produce pig nickel iron, raw material, in the form of nickel laterite ore, generally must be sourced from outside of China, with Indonesia and the Philippines accounting for most nickel laterite ore production globally.The mining of nickel laterite ore reserves out of Indonesia increased quite a bit as a result, with several notable Chinese joint ventures in operation or planning operations within Indonesia.Recently, China's Tsingshan Group, for example, partnered with GEM Co Ltd for the buildout of additional nickel-related production facilities in Sulawesi, a nickel mining hub in Indonesia. The recent project, which just broke ground in January, aims to develop nickel sulphate for export, slated for use in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles (EVs).An earlier 2017 joint venture between Tsingshan and ERAMET formed around the nickel deposit at Weda Bay -- said to house 9.3 million tons of nickel -- focuses on nickel ferroalloy production.This month, the 304/304L-Coil and 316/316L-Coil NAS surcharges remained the same as last month.
