Steel Billet Surges, Futures Could Be Harbinger of an April DropSteel surged today on the LME, despite a drop in futures contracts. Reuters reported that Chinese steel and iron ore futures dropped for a second session on Monday after weak manufacturing data added to signs of a slowdown in Chinese economy, which may curb its demand for the commodities. Despite the outlook for April and beyond, the steel billet cash price saw a 2.6 percent increase on Monday, reaching $390.00 per metric ton on the LME and making it the biggest mover for the day.
