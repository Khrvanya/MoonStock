Steel Plate, Crude Oil Prices Hit New Lows, Renewable Energy Metals Index StuckCrude oil prices are at their lowest since 2012, with Brent crude falling 2% to hit $92 a barrel, while the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price coming in under the $90-per-barrel benchmark at $88.60. That is to say, this fossil fuel - in the same way as coal - remains economical for US producers and manufacturers. Which, in turn, may make the case for producers of wind and solar energy a bit tougher, at least in the near-to-medium term. But as long as the US and Chinese governments keep offering breaks and subsidies for solar investment, why not ride the "Uneconomical Express" train just a bit longer? (Ok, that was a bit harsh - but until we see an irrefutably strong economic argument emerge from the renewables side, artificial support will continue.)Particularly interesting to us is the progressive weakening of steel plate prices across global regions, as well as that of neodymium, within our monthly Renewables MMI(r), which overall registered a value of 66 in October, unmoved from September's value.Get the full prices within our renewable energy metals index and more commentary by clicking below.
