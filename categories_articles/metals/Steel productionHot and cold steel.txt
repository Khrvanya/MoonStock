Steel productionHot and cold steelIN 2009 China produced 47% of the world's total output of steel. It was one of just four countries that managed to increase its output in 2009, in a year in which global production fell by 8%. China's ambitious projects to improve it infrastructure rapidly require plenty of the metal. China has also spent much of the past two years trying to secure iron ore for steel production on better terms. It paid A$286m ($238m) for 15% of Aquila Resources, an Australian mining firm, in August 2009. However, attempts to purchase large stakes in other mining companies have proved tricky. An offer to increase a Chinese state-controlled firm's stake in Rio Tinto to 19% in 2009, and perhaps influence prices for iron ore, was rebuffed. AP
