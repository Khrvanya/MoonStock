Study London Silver Fix Suppresses PricesThe best part of the London Silver Price Fixing is that it will soon disappear, a researcher at the University of Western Australia and a subject matter expert told Kitco News.FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering the Precious markets.Andrew Caminschi is the author of a newly published report that looks at the silver market and the daily price fixing process. Caminschi analyzed 14 years of silver market data and said his research shows the fix creates "statistically lower prices.""This study finds a 10-12 (basis point) downward bias in the intraday price of silver around the time of the fixing. This represents three times the average daily return on silver over the same period," Caminschi wrote in his paper as one of his five key findings.He added that the price suppression around the fix is unwound within an hour of the end of the auction style price mechanism.Other findings he noted as a result of his research include "strong empirical evidence that price behavior of the fixing is significantly different to that of open markets instruments (spot and silver futures) trading at the same time;" as well he noted that market participants with prior knowledge of price direction have a daily average advantage of 25 basis points over uniformed traders.The silver fix is a teleconference among several banks to set silver prices for the day. It will be ended August 15, to be replaced by a new electronic benchmark to be administered jointly by Thomson Reuters and the CME Group.The price of US silver fell 1.3 percent on Monday, July 21 to $20.89 per ounce, making it the day's biggest mover.
