Swiss National Bank Head Speaks Out Against Gold Reserve ActThe head of Switzerland's central bank warned his fellow citizens that maintaining stable prices would be harder to achieve if the country votes to require the bank to keep a minimum amount of gold in its vaults, according to the Wall Street Journal.FREE Download: The Monthly MMI(r) Report - covering the Precious markets.The adoption of the so-called "Save Our Swiss Gold" initiative would be a "fatal error of judgment," Thomas Jordan, president of the Swiss National Bank, told Swiss newspaper 20 Minuten in an interview published Wednesday. On Nov. 30, the Swiss are scheduled to vote in a referendum on the initiative to make the Swiss National Bank to hold one fifth of its assets in gold, a level it would need to meet within 5 years. The SNB currently has assets of around $550 billion. It was a rare public statement from the head of the bank.The requirement, the campaign for which is led by members of the right-wing Swiss People's Party, would also prohibit the bank from selling any of its gold in the future and repatriate gold held overseas. A recent poll showed the vote was too close to call with 44% of respondents in favor of the initiative, 39% against and 17% undecided. A majority of voters and a majority of Switzerland's 26 cantons, akin to states, need to approve the initiative for it to pass.Japanese gold bullion saw a 2.1% increase on Tuesday, November 11, reaching JPY 4,295 ($39.45) per gram and making it the biggest upwards shift of the day.
