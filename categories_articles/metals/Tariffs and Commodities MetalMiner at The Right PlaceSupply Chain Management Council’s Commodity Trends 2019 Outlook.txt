Businesses have been forced to pay extra attention to risky links in their supply chains, particularly as tariff totals continue to rise between the U.S. and China.Other speakers at the event covered other angles of the tariff topic, including exemptions, Section 301 at large and the long-term view.MetalMiner's Taras Berezowsky covered the event for sister site SpendMatters:From the multiple expert presentations to numerous audience questions and comments on the topic, it didn't take much to pinpoint the effects of tariffs as a recurring theme of the half-day conference, at which MetalMiner Executive Editor Lisa Reisman presented our 2019 metals outlook. Indeed, the current onslaught of tariffs -- including those implemented under Sections 201, 232 and 301 of U.S. trade law -- seemed to be one of the primary concerns on everyone's minds. The hosting group's primary goal is to equip West Michigan businesses, mainly small and medium-sized manufacturers, with the knowledge they need to manage their commodity strategies. Given the current trade environment, it's no surprise that many of the event's key takeaways centered around what types of actions these manufacturers can -- or should -- take to avoid risks created current and potential tariffs.For more efficient carbon steel buying strategies, take a free trial of MetalMiner's Monthly Outlook!Read Berezowsky's full recap of the event here.Your email address will not be published.
