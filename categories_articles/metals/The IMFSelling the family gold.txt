The IMFSelling the family goldIT HAS whipped many developing countries into shape. Now it is time for the IMF to apply the birch to its own back. With crisis lending down, the fund has not been generating enough income to cover its $1 billion budget. By 2010 its deficit will be some $400m a year. It has enough reserves to tide it over. But ultimately it needs its own financial rescue plan.Which is why, on April 7th, the fund's board agreed to cut costs and boost income. A quarter of the gap will be plugged by cutting costs, including 380 jobs (or 15% of the total). The rest will come from new income sources. It wants to sell about 12.5% of its vast gold stocks, which amounts to 403.3 tonnes, and create an endowment with the proceeds. Using a (conservative) price estimate of $850 an ounce, the fund reckons such a sale would raise about $11 billion. In order to avoid upsetting the gold market, it would be done over several years.The fund also wants to broaden its investment strategy. At present it may invest its reserves only in government bonds. In future, it hopes to boost returns by half a percentage point a year by broadening its portfolio to include corporate bonds and perhaps shares. Is the doughty IMF to become an international version of a sovereign-wealth fund--ready to help recapitalise American banks or invest in a private-equity firm? Hardly. Conflicts of interest would be legion, so the investments will be made slowly and conservatively. Buying assets beyond government bonds requires a change in the fund's Articles of Agreement, which demands parliamentary ratification in many of the IMF's 185 member countries. The gold sales, too, face hurdles. America's Congress must approve--and hitherto senators from gold-producing states such as Nevada have been loth to agree. But with gold still near $1,000 an ounce, they may just be amenable.
