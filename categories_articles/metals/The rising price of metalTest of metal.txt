The rising price of metalTest of metalCassandra has already discussed soaring, volatile food prices as a major risk in 2011. The markets for raw materials will be no less eventful, according to the latest forecasts from the Economist Intelligence Unit. The EIU's metals index soared by 39% in 2010, with a further 9% rise in the index predicted this year. Prices for humble tin are expected to rise by 24% this year, on top of a 50% jump in 2010. Half of the world's tin is used for solder, with China the most voracious user. The country's tin consumption touched a record last year, and production of consumer electronics and appliances is expected to remain robust. Production problems in Indonesia, the world's second-largest tin supplier, will also support prices.At the other end of the scale, steel prices are expected to slip by 3%, following a rise of more than 30% last year. China is the story, again, as efforts to cool its economy--and construction in particular--will loom large in global steel markets. Building in developed economies will remain subdued, offering little boost to demand. Overall, more muted price rises for metals in 2011 will offer some relief to heavy industries after an across-the-board surge in 2010. But this will not be as welcome among commodities traders, who took advantage of capricious conditions in metals markets last year to make a mint.
