The world in figures IndustriesMetals and miningAs China's economy slows, demand for commodities will shift but not retreat. Painful adjustments loom for those who nailed their colours to Chinese demand for things like iron ore--think Australia and firms such as Rio Tinto. Too much steel, especially in China, will knock 11% off the metal's price. But those producing tin (for electronics) or lead (for electric-bicycle batteries) will gain from China's consumer shift. Chinese demand for lead will grow by 8% in 2014 and, since China accounts for 45% of the metal's demand, prices will also jump.In the West, investment banks that serve as intermediaries in the metals trade will receive greater regulatory scrutiny. Banks are accused of artificially extending waiting times to move aluminium and other base metals out of warehouses licensed by the London Metal Exchange, which proposes to introduce rules to hurry things up from April 2014. This will boost the supply of aluminium and these other metals, but markets will have already priced in much of the effect.Indeed, thanks to stronger demand, the Economist Intelligence Unit's index of base-metal prices will rebound by 4.7% in the coming year, largely regaining the ground it lost in 2013, though still far short of 2011 levels. Gold will be an outlier: a victim of the Federal Reserve's move to curb liquidity, its appeal as a hedge against inflation will be tarnished further; the price will slide by over 6%.
