The world in numbers IndustriesMetals and MiningDespite China's slowdown, it is still the chief mover of commodities markets. It consumes half of all copper and aluminium, major components of the EIU index of industrial materials. Scandals surrounding the (mis)use of metal as collateral at Qingdao port will frighten off foreign creditors, and stockbuilding and financial demand there will dwindle. But China's real needs remain robust: in 2015 it will again be much the biggest source of new demand for both metals. The build-out of China's power grid will suck in more copper, as will its secretive strategic reserve. China's consumption will swell by 7%, though its own production will rise by 9%; global copper prices will stabilise. Urbanisation in China and a shift towards lightweight vehicles will spur aluminium demand and supply. But aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) will surge by 16.5% in 2015, as availability is tight outside China. Importers of nickel ore are in hoarding mode, and stocks will run low in 2015: Indonesia's new government will come under pressure to overturn its ban on exporting raw materials. Car manufacturers will want more of the metal in 2015, as will stainless-steel makers. LME nickel prices will spike. To watch: Cut and dig. Owners of big mining firms will find reasons to celebrate, as their loud complaints prompt managers to stop expanding and refocus on digging stuff up more efficiently. The largest of the lot, BHP Billiton, will split up; Rio Tinto, the second-largest, will cut capital expenditure to $8bn in 2015, less than half its 2012 peak. But many of the best, easy-to-reach resources are already extracted; mining the rest will be expensive. Neither can miners simply shift production to high-margin alternatives. Iron ore and coal once fitted the bill, but prices are down.
