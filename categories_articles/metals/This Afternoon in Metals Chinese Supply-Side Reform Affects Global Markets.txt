This Afternoon in Metals Chinese Supply-Side Reform Affects Global Marketsgui yong nian/Adobe StockThis afternoon in metals news, supply-side reform in China is having significant effects on global markets, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer calls for trade action to combat cheap imports of steel and aluminum from China and other countries, and scientists have resolved a long-standing mystery about a prehistoric copper smelting event.Benchmark Your Current Metal Price by Grade, Shape and Alloy: See How it Stacks UpThere are many who question the impact of China's efforts to curtail excess production, but according to a report by Platts, supply-side reforms in the country are having major impacts around the world.China's net steel exports through the first seven months of the year were down almost a third, according to the report. Hot rolled coil prices have also risen in the process, reaching their highest point since 2013."Given the current protectionist bent that seems to span the globe, it will be interesting to see how China's metal exports will be perceived in a few years' time," the Platts report concludes. "In the US, for example, there is not enough steel capacity to deliver upon the infra-build being promised by President Trump, should Section 232 be imposed, and the build go ahead."The Trump administration launched Section 232 investigations into imports of steel and aluminum, with a particular focus on China.On Tuesday, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, sounded a similar note, according to a report in the Watertown Daily Times."There are top notch manufactures like Alcoa and Nucor ready to provide high-quality aluminum and steel to businesses in and around the country, but China's overproduction has resulted in a substantial threat to Upstate New York's metal industry by making it almost impossible for companies that play by the rules to compete," Schumer said in a statement.According to the report, Schumer has sent letters to Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on the matter.For more than half a century, the origins of a copper smelting event at a prehistoric archaeological site has remained a mystery.But recently, a team of scientists hit paydirt at the Late Neolithic site of Catalhoyuk in central Turkey."Scholars have been hotly debating the origins and spread of metallurgy for decades, mainly due to the relationship this technology had with the rise of social complexity and economy of the world's first civilisations in the Near East," according to a report in phys.org.Free Download: The July 2017 MMI ReportAccording to the report, a study published Tuesday in the Journal of Archaeological Science concludes that that after "the re-examination of a c. 8,500-year-old by-product from metal smelting, or 'slag', from the site of Catalhoyuk presents the conclusive reconstruction of events that led to the firing of a small handful of green copper minerals."Your email address will not be published.
