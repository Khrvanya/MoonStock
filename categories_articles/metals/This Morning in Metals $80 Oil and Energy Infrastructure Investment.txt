Request your two-month free trial of MetalMiner's OutlookIn a CNBC interview, Shell CEO Ben van Beurden said $80 oil would not be unreasonable and would support energy infrastructure investment.Van Beurden added some of the Trump administration's quotas on steel imports have impacted the company's construction projects.MetalMiner's Take: Shell is probably right in estimating the world can afford $80/barrel oil prices without harming growth; certainly, the U.S. economy is testament to that at the moment.But rising steel costs due to import tariffs are causing oil companies headaches when funding new infrastructure projects, projects the industry desperately needs to overcome transportation bottlenecks and meet rising refined product demand overseas.Outside of the U.S., oil majors are pushing ahead with large investments in a buoyant refining market. Exxon just announced a half-billion-dollar upgrade to its giant Fawley refinery in the U.K. to meet rising demand, surely a sign the oil price and demand trump construction costs.According to a Reuters report, the Chinese steelmaking heavyweight China Baowu Steel Group is in talks to acquire rival Magang Group.Per the report, the combined output of Baowu and Magang last year surpassed total U.S. production.Base metal prices struggled on Tuesday, according to a Reuters report, on the heels of a one-day closure of Chinese markets.For more efficient carbon steel buying strategies, take a free trial of MetalMiner's Monthly Outlook!After surging Friday, LME copper dropped 0.8% on Tuesday.Your email address will not be published.
