"The Taranto plant has been under seizure since 2012 and cannot be operated without legal protection until the environmental plan is implemented."The steelmaker continues added the Crescita law removes "legal safeguards.""However, the Crescita law decree removes the legal safeguards existing when ArcelorMittal agreed to invest in the Taranto plant," the firm said. "These safeguards are necessary until the company has completed the environmental plan to avoid incurring liability for issues that it did not create."With the law set to be ratified by June 29, the steelmaker said amendments can be made."AMI remains hopeful that, as part of the amendment process, legal certainty will be restored in the interest of the Italian economy and of the stakeholders of ArcelorMittal Italia, enabling AMI to continue operate of the plant while completing the environmental requalification plan," the firm said.Vietnam will impose anti-dumping duties on imports of coated steel from China and South Korea, S&P Global Platts reported.According to the report, the duties are set to take effect June 25 and extend for about four months.The No. 1 copper producer in the world, Chile's Codelco, is facing a work stoppage at its Chuquicamata mine, Bloomberg reported.Want to see an Aluminum Price forecast?
