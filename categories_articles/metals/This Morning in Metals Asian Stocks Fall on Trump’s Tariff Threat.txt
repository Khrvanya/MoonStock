"Despite several measures taken recent years to improve the situation, it has not been possible to turn the negative development."The closure will affect around 40 employees and is expected to be completed by Q1 2020. Employees, the Works Council, trade unions and other stakeholders have been informed and Hydro will work hard to ensure the restructuring process is carried out in a professional and respectful way for all parties involved."The E.U., in an effort to combat rising imports and diverted steel supplies as a result of the U.S.'s Section 232 tariff, earlier this year imposed steel safeguards (which it adjusted in September).However, many in the sector have argued the steel safeguards have not been effective, particularly with respect to the built-in incremental increases in steel quota levels.Looking for metal price forecasting and data analysis in one easy-to-use platform?

"We have seen a contraction of at least 3% this year, even as raw material prices and CO2 costs have boomed. In particular, these CO2 costs are not borne by any other producers around the world."This year, European steel companies have had to announce production cuts of at least 15 million tonnes; 15,000 jobs have been lost or put at risk. This is in addition to the 20% decline in the steel workforce since 2008."EUROFER also made reference to global excess capacity, particularly with respect to China."EUROFER requests that the safeguard be realigned to reflect the fact that the quota volumes were set far above traditional EU import levels, and that since then market conditions have considerably deteriorated," EUROFER said."EUROFER also believes that, in the context of the informal discussion on China planned during the Foreign Affairs Council, ministers should reflect on China's refusal to support the extension of the mandate of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity."Your email address will not be published.
