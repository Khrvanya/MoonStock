The company announced Thursday that it has begun commercial production of batteries using an increased portion of nickel (as opposed to the expensive, and scarce, cobalt)."The batteries will help extend a driving range of electric vehicles up to 500 kms, and we will also develop new batteries by 2020 that can provide a range of more than 700 kms," Lee Jon-ha, principal researcher of the company's battery R&D center, said in a statement quoted by Reuters.Free Download: The August 2017 MMI ReportYour email address will not be published.
