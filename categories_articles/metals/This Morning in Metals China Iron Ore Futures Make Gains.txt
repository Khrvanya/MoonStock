"Following extensive efforts to resolve this concern, USTR is requesting consultations at this time because recently drafted amendments to Korea's 'Monopoly Regulations and Fair Trade Act' fail to address U.S. concerns that KFTC hearings continue to deny U.S. firms due process rights under the KORUS agreement that are necessary to secure a fair competition hearing in Korea."In other China news, the country's inventories of hot-rolled coil have declined for the third straight week, according to Shanghai Metals Market.MetalMiner's Annual Outlook provides 2019 buying strategies for carbon steelAccording to the report, HRC inventories were 3.64 million tons as of March 14, down 1.1% from the previous week and down 4.7% from the same period in 2018.Your email address will not be published.
