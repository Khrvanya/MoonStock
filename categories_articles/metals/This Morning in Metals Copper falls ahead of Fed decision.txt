Through their method, the scientists seek to perfect a process that curbs the negative environmental impacts of processing metals, using easily recyclable compounds instead of toxic materials.The discovery was the result of a collaboration between Jean-Philip Lumb and Tomislav Friscic at McGill University in Montreal, and Kim Baines of Western University in London, Ont.As demand for electric vehicles grows and green initiatives become more visible, it's not surprising to see movement toward making the entire production process going green -- for example, from the processing of raw metals all the way to a final product itself (a "green" vehicle).It isn't a good time for nickel, which fell to its lowest price in a year Tuesday in a climate of falling Chinese steel prices and a weak forecast for the Chinese economy, Reuters reported.As the Chinese government tackles credit debts -- the nation was recently downgraded by rating agency Moody's for the first time since 1989 -- many expect growth to slow in the second half of the year.
