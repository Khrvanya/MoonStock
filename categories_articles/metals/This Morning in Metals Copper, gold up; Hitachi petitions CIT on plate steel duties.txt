Given analysts'  expectations of a Chinese growth slowdown in the second half of 2017, among other factors, it would not surprise to see copper experience setbacks throughout the remainder of the calendar year.Similarly, gold neared its year-to-date high on Tuesday, Reuters reported.The rise comes in a climate of political uncertainty, with an election in the United Kingdom, former FBI Director James Comey's testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday and a European Central Bank meeting this week.As is sometimes the case, the "safe-haven" metal is turned to by some investors in times of market uncertainty.Hitachi Metals Ltd., a Japanese steel plate manufacturer, filed two complaints on Tuesday to the U.S. Court of International Trade, Law360 reported.In the complaints against the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) and the Department of Commerce (DoC), Hitachi asks the court to get rid of anti-dumping and countervailing duties on tool steel, claiming that it is a specialty class of merchandise and was improperly included in a broader investigation into carbon and alloy steel plate, according to the article.Hitachi argues in the complaints that the ITC and DoC abandoned previous practice of treating tool steel as a "separate class or kind of merchandise from other [cut-to-length] plate products."Free Download: The May 2017 MMI ReportYour email address will not be published.
