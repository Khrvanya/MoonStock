In 2013, we set an ambitious target to become the first carbon neutral aluminium company from a lifecycle perspective by 2020. Now, when our 2020 target is within reach, we are setting a new ambition for cutting our own emissions by 30% by 2030," President and CEO Hilde Merete Aasheim.Copper prices ticked up Tuesday after positive news from the U.S.-China trade front.U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He in two weeks (the two countries held deputy-level talks last week).Free Partial Sample Report: 2020 MetalMiner Annual Metals OutlookAs such, LME three-month copper rose 0.3% Tuesday, up to $5,794/mt, Reuters reported.Your email address will not be published.
