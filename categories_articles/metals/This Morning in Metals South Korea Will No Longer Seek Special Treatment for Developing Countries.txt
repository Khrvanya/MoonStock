"For example, 7 out of the 10 wealthiest economies in the world as measured by Gross Domestic Product per capita on a purchasing-power parity basis -- Brunei, Hong Kong, Kuwait, Macao, Qatar, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates -- currently claim developing-country status.  Mexico, South Korea, and Turkey -- members of both the G20 and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) -- also claim this status."Through the first half of 2019, South Korea accounted for 9% of U.S. steel imports (1.3 million metric tons).Iron ore exports from Australia's Port Hedland are expected to hit a record high this fiscal year, according to a Bloomberg report.According to the report, iron ore volumes from the port last year reached 508.5 million tons.Rio Tinto has commissioned new press filter technology at its Vaudreuil alumina refinery in Quebec.Free Partial Sample Report: 2020 MetalMiner Annual Metals Outlook"The new filter presses will deliver environmental benefits by moving the refinery to dry stacking of bauxite residue and extend the life of the operation, which supports 1,000 jobs in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region," the company said. "The presses will ramp up to being fully operational in early 2020."The new presses will be able to dry bauxite residue -- preparing it for storage -- in just 17 minutes, according to Rio Tinto, down from the three years it currently takes to dry the material.Your email address will not be published.
