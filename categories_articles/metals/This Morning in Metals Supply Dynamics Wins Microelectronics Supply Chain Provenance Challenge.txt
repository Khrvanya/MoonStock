"Supreme Court approval of AMIPL's resolution plan is the final procedural step in ESIL's corporate insolvency process."Completion of the transaction is now expected before the end of the year. After completion, ArcelorMittal will jointly own and operate ESIL in partnership with Nippon Steel Corporation ('Nippon Steel'), Japan's largest steel producer and the third largest steel producer in the world, in-line with the joint venture formation agreement signed by the two companies."Looking for metal price forecasting and data analysis in one easy-to-use platform?
