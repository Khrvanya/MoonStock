Request your two-month free trial of MetalMiner's OutlookTokyo Steel plans to raise heavy plate prices by 2.5% in December, according to a Reuters report. The steelmaker had not raised heavy plate prices since January, the report noted.MetalMiner's Take: Plate prices have always had their own price dynamics separate from the other forms of flat rolled steel (such as HRC and CRC).Plate prices in the U.S. have remained fairly well-supported compared to the other forms of steel, so it should come as no surprise that in markets with strong construction demand, like Japan, mills would announce price increases.Interestingly, Chinese plate prices have started to slip, but those dynamics could change based on environmental curbs, whether the Japanese plate price increases stick and Chinese demand.U.S. metal-buying organizations will want to pay close attention to these price dynamics in Japan and China.Aluminum CapacityRio Tinto Group says the world needs new aluminum capacity outside of China in the coming years, Bloomberg reported.Prices of LME and SHFE copper increased Monday, Reuters reported, on the heels of positive sentiment stemming from comments made by President Donald Trump regarding tariffs on China.MetalMiner's Annual Outlook provides 2019 buying strategies for carbon steelDuring a press briefing Monday, Trump said the U.S. might not need to impose further tariffs on China, the world's top copper consumer.Your email address will not be published.
