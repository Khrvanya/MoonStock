"The United States has been an active and committed partner in this process, working to seek prompt implementation of the Forum's past policy recommendations, which are aimed at reducing excess capacity as well as restoring balance and market function in the global steel sector."However, the USTR argued the forum has not done enough to realize its goals."Unfortunately, what we have seen to date leaves us questioning whether the Forum is capable of delivering on these objectives," the statement continued. "We do not see an equal commitment to the process from all Forum members. Commitments to provide timely information critical to the proper functioning of the Forum's work, for example, have gone unfulfilled. More importantly, we have yet to see any concrete progress toward true market-based reform in the economies that have contributed most to the crisis of excess capacity in the steel sector."Chinese construction steel rebar prices were up Friday, according to a Reuters report.According to the report, the most-active contract on the SHFE rose 0.1% on Friday.On the heels of Washington's announcement this week of the forthcoming imposition of tariffs worth $200 billion on imports of Chinese goods, Walmart wrote a letter to USTR Robert Lighthizer warning that it may have to raise prices, Reuters reported.MetalMiner's Annual Outlook provides 2018 buying strategies for carbon steelAccording to the report, the letter cited products which could be hit with price increases, which included gas grills, bicycles and Christmas lights.Your email address will not be published.
