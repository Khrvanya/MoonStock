Toyota May Halt Production Due to Steel Shortage, Plant ExplosionToyota Motor Corp. said on Saturday it may halt production at its domestic plants early next month due to a steel shortage, following an explosion at a steel plant operated by one of its affiliates.Free Download: The January 2016 MMI ReportThe blast at an Aichi Steel plant has curbed production of steel parts, which may impact output at the world's best-selling automaker which produces around 40% of its global output in Japan."At the moment, there is enough supply inventory to keep our domestic plants running until Feb. 6," a Toyota spokesman told Reuters, adding that overtime and weekend shifts for next week had been canceled."After that, we will be monitoring our supply situation on a day-by-day basis and decide accordingly."

Their historical policy of tri-sourcing with some 60/20/20 supplier mix should prevent precisely this type of shut-down. Sole-sourcing is an inherently risky strategy for precisely this reason.I'd bet that Toyota has another supplier waiting in the wings before a plant shut-down. If not, it sounds like we'll have another story! LARIf Japan would open its markets to more U.S. SBQ suppliers such situations could be mitigated.Great point!Your email address will not be published.
