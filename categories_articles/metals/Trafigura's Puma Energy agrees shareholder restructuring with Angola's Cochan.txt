Trafigura's Puma Energy agrees shareholder restructuring with Angola's CochanLONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - Puma Energy, the fuel retail arm of Trafigura, has agreed a shareholder restructuring that would reduce take the stake of a retired Angolan general to less than 5%. Puma said late on Sunday that Geneva-based commodities trader Trafigura would buy back Cochan Holdings' shares which will then be re-purchased by Puma. General Leopoldino Fragoso do Nascimento, known as General Dino, holds a 15% stake in Puma via Cochan while Trafigura has 49% and Angola's state oil firm 28%. "The re-purchase by Puma Energy will be funded by a subordinated shareholder loan from Trafigura with an initial tenor of seven years," Puma's statement said.
