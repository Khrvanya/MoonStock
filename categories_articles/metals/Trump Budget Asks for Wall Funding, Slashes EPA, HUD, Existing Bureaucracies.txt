It significantly cuts funding to global institutions such as the World Bank and the United Nations, too.While the budget notes that plans and costs for the border wall are not yet completed, according to Mulvaney, the budget will include a request for $1.5 billion as the first installment payment for the promised wall and then another installment of $2.26 billion in 2018.The American Iron and Steel Institute recently reported that for the month of January 2017, U.S. steel mills shipped 7,708,416 net tons, a 7.5% increase from the 7,173,245 nt shipped in the previous month and a 9.6% increase from the 7,031,307 nt shipped in January 2016.Two-Month Trial: Metal Buying OutlookA comparison of January 2017 shipments to the previous month of December 2016 shows the following changes: hot-dipped galvanized sheets, up 14%, cold rolled sheets, up 13% and hot-rolled sheets, up 4%.Your email address will not be published.
