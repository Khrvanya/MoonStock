Turkey Steel Production to Up 8% in 2014; Korean Steel Scrap DownGood news for Turkey... "Turkey's steel production is expected to grow by 8 percent this year to 37.5 million tonnes thanks to global economic recovery, big infrastructure investments and urban regeneration projects ahead of local elections, its Steel Producers Association said," reports Reuters."Turkey was among the countries whose steel output fell by the most last year - by 3.4 percent to 34.65 million tonnes, the association's secretary-general, Veysel Yayan, told Reuters in answers to e-mailed questions.""Idle capacity in the world steel sector and squeezed profit margins weighed on competition and increasing imports, curbing Turkey's steel output in 2013, Yayan said. But the picture was expected to turn rosier this year, he said.""'Along with the recovery in the global economy and local elections, giant infrastructure investments as well as urban regeneration projects will help accelerate Turkey's steel consumption,' he said."In metal  price news for steel...Chinese steel prices were flat for the day.
