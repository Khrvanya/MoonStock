U.K. Politicians Get Serious About Supporting Local SteelToday, U.K. politicians are somewhat belatedly calling for requirements that national infrastructure projects use U.K. steel. Meanwhile, Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp are said to be eying a merger.U.K. Leaders said on Sunday that U.K. steel producers must be considered for infrastructure and other government contracts involving steel supplies, as part of plans to find a long-term solution to a crisis in the industry. The government is looking for ways to support domestic steel producers after India's Tata Steel put its loss-making British plant up for sale on Wednesday, putting thousands of jobs at risk.Speaking of which, Tata Steel and Germany's Thyssenkrupp have been talking about combining their European steel operations, a person aware of the talks said on Friday. The source, who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to speak publicly, said talks had been ongoing for about a year but declined to comment on their current status.Your email address will not be published.
