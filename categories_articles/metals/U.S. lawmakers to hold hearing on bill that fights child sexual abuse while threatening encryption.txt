U.S. lawmakers to hold hearing on bill that fights child sexual abuse while threatening encryptionWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate Judiciary Committee said on Wednesday it would hold a hearing on March 11 to discuss legislation aimed at curbing the online distribution of child sexual abuse material and penalizing companies that offer encryption.
