"We continue to call on the PRC to immediately release all those arbitrarily detained, and to end its draconian policies that for more than two years have terrorized its own citizens in Xinjiang," the embassy said an emailed statement to Reuters, quoting an unnamed spokesperson. It was referring to China by the initials of its official name, People's Republic of China.  Reporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman
