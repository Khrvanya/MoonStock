UC Rusal Reports Lower First Quarter Earnings, Backs New CME Aluminum ContractUC Rusal, the largest producer of aluminum in the world, narrowed its loss from the previous quarter even as aluminum prices sank to five year lows, which analysts said was a good sign that earnings may be near the bottom.
