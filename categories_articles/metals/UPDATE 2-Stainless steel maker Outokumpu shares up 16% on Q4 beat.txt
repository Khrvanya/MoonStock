Outokumpu said the raw materials-related profit boost included improved raw material efficiency and hedging. Outokumpu, which is due to publish fourth quarter results on Feb. 5, said adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) in the period would be around 70 million euros ($77.7 million), up from earlier guidance of around 45 million. Analysts were expecting adjusted EBITDA of 44.6 million euros, according to Refinitiv data, with estimates ranging from 26 million to 56 million.

Shares in Outokumpu jumped 16% in early trade to 3.29 euros, their highest since May. ($1 = 0.9010 euros) (Reporting by Tarmo Virki; Editing by Alex Richardson; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)
