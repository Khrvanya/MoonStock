United Airlines pulls Boeing 737 MAX from schedule until Sept 4CHICAGO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc said on Friday it is extending the cancellation of Boeing 737 MAX flights until Sept. 4, a fresh delay that comes as sources told Reuters that the timing of a key certification flight may not happen until at least April. U.S. airlines that operate Boeing Co's 737 MAX, which was grounded worldwide last March after two fatal crashes, had last pulled the jet from their flight schedules until early June. On Thursday, Southwest Airlines Co extended its MAX cancellations until Aug. 10. (Reporting by Tracy Rucinski Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
