Wall Street bounce too little, too late as world stocks post shock weekly declineNEW YORK (Reuters) - Coronavirus panic sent world stock markets tumbling again on Friday, with an index of global stocks setting its largest weekly fall since the 2008 global financial crisis, and over $5 trillion wiped from global market value this week. U.S. stocks shaved most of the day's losses late in the New York session but only the Nasdaq eked out a positive close. The Dow lost nearly 3,600 points this week and the S&P 500 posted a double-digit weekly percentage loss for only the fifth time since 1940. Yields on U.S. government bonds, widely seen as the world's most secure asset, ended the day near the fresh record lows.

Countries other than China now account for about three-quarters of new infections. "The uncertainty hovering over the markets will only be alleviated when there is a sense that the worst is almost over," said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial Inc.

The Nasdaq Composite added 0.89 points, or 0.01%, to 8,567.37. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.76% for a weekly loss over 10%, its second largest on record. The over $5 trillion lost in market capitalization globally this week is roughly equivalent to Japan's yearly GDP, the third-largest in the world. Japan's Nikkei futures lost 0.28%.
