White House stays mum about hearing participation as deadline passesWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's White House made no public statement as of a 6 p.m. (2300 GMT) deadline on Sunday to say whether he would send legal counsel to participate in a congressional impeachment hearing this week. Although the deadline passed, it was not immediately known if the White House had been in contact with the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee about whether Trump would participate in the hearing on Wednesday.
