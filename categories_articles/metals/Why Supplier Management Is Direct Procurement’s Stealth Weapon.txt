Why Supplier Management Is Direct Procurement’s Stealth WeaponCalling all MetalMiner readers in direct procurement - we've got a webinar for you this Thursday, Feb. 13, from 1-2pm CT (2-3pm ET):REGISTER HERE!Supplier management is near and dear to our overall coverage of the procurement and supply chain market across the Spend Matters Network.But let's face it - you're busy doing other stuff, and supplier management is rarely a priority by itself.As much as the entire Spend Matters team has shown irrational exuberance around supplier management tools since they went mainstream a few years ago, we admit that things like maintaining a clean vendor master and on-boarding new suppliers as seamlessly as possible often falls down the priority list compared to near-term sourcing wins.Yet for manufacturers, supplier management represents the one central technology area that can enable organizations to systematically reduce supply chain risk, improve supplier quality, and develop the right set of suppliers to drive overall product innovation.Not only that, supplier management can be a massive enabler for spend analytics, e-sourcing, supply chain network design, category management, transactional procurement, e-invoicing, and trade financing. (Whew!)Join us this Thursday as we explore 10 ways that supplier management can be the critical stealth enabler for procurement organizations of all kinds, acting as a force multiplier on virtually all of your other procurement, accounts payable, treasury, and risk management initiatives. We'll be sure to pay special attention to specific use cases for manufacturing organizations.We'll even cover elements of how to build a basic business case and ROI model for supplier management - and you'll see how to cover your costs for such initiatives just by making accounts payable and transactional procurement types happy.This webinar is free for all procurement practitioners (as well as all Spend Matters Plus/PRO subscribers).
